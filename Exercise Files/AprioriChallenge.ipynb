The data is in transactional format (as opposed to tabular format), which means that each row is a list of items purchased together and that the items may be in different order. There are 58 columns in each row, each column either contains a document ID or no data. (This dataset differs from the `Groceries` dataset in that it does not use `NaN` for blank cells, which makes the data file much smaller.)\n",
