514	PLAYING PILGRIMS
514	""
514	"""Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,"" grumbled Jo, lying"
514	on the rug.
514	""
514	"""It's so dreadful to be poor!"" sighed Meg, looking down at her old"
514	dress.
514	""
514	"""I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty"
514	"things, and other girls nothing at all,"" added little Amy, with an"
514	injured sniff.
514	""
514	"""We've got Father and Mother, and each other,"" said Beth contentedly"
514	from her corner.
514	""
514	The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the
514	"cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, ""We haven't got"
514	"Father, and shall not have him for a long time."" She didn't say"
514	"""perhaps never,"" but each silently added it, thinking of Father far"
514	away, where the fighting was.
514	""
514	"Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, ""You know"
514	the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was
514	because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we
514	ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in
514	the army.  We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and
514	"ought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don't,"" and Meg shook her"
514	head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.
514	""
514	"""But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good.  We've"
514	each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving
514	that.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want
514	"to buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself.  I've wanted it so long,"" said"
514	Jo, who was a bookworm.
514	""
514	"""I planned to spend mine in new music,"" said Beth, with a little sigh,"
514	which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.
514	""
514	"""I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need"
514	"them,"" said Amy decidedly."
514	""
514	"""Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to"
514	give up everything.  Let's each buy what we want, and have a little
514	"fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,"" cried Jo, examining the"
514	heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.
514	""
514	"""I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm"
514	"longing to enjoy myself at home,"" began Meg, in the complaining tone"
514	again.
514	""
514	"""You don't have half such a hard time as I do,"" said Jo. ""How would you"
514	like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps
514	you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to
514	"fly out the window or cry?"""
514	""
514	"""It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things"
514	tidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands
514	"get so stiff, I can't practice well at all."" And Beth looked at her"
514	rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.
514	""
514	"""I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,"" cried Amy, ""for you don't"
514	have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you
514	don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your
514	"father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice."""
514	""
514	"""If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa"
514	"was a pickle bottle,"" advised Jo, laughing."
514	""
514	"""I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's"
514	"proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,"" returned Amy,"
514	with dignity.
514	""
514	"""Don't peck at one another, children.  Don't you wish we had the money"
514	Papa lost when we were little, Jo?  Dear me! How happy and good we'd
514	"be, if we had no worries!"" said Meg, who could remember better times."
514	""
514	"""You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the"
514	King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in
514	"spite of their money."""
514	""
514	"""So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,"
514	"we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say."""
514	""
514	"""Jo does use such slang words!"" observed Amy, with a reproving look at"
514	the long figure stretched on the rug.
514	""
514	Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to
514	whistle.
514	""
514	"""Don't, Jo.  It's so boyish!"""
514	""
514	"""That's why I do it."""
514	""
514	"""I detest rude, unladylike girls!"""
514	""
514	"""I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!"""
514	""
514	"""Birds in their little nests agree,"" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with"
514	such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the
514	"""pecking"" ended for that time."
514	""
514	"""Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,"" said Meg, beginning to"
514	"lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. ""You are old enough to leave off"
514	boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn't matter so
514	much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up
514	"your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady."""
514	""
514	"""I'm not!   And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two"
514	"tails till I'm twenty,"" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down"
514	"a chestnut mane.  ""I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss"
514	March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster!  It's
514	bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy's games and work and
514	manners!  I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy.  And
514	it's worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa. And
514	"I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!"""
514	""
514	And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like
514	castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.
514	""
514	"""Poor Jo!  It's too bad, but it can't be helped.  So you must try to be"
514	contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us
514	"girls,"" said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the"
514	dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its
514	touch.
514	""
514	"""As for you, Amy,"" continued Meg, ""you are altogether too particular"
514	and prim.  Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected
514	little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and
514	refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant.  But your
514	"absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang."""
514	""
514	"""If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?"" asked Beth,"
514	ready to share the lecture.
514	""
514	"""You're a dear, and nothing else,"" answered Meg warmly, and no one"
514	contradicted her, for the 'Mouse' was the pet of the family.
514	""
514	As young readers like to know 'how people look', we will take this
514	moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat
514	knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly
514	without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within.  It was a comfortable
514	room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a
514	good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,
514	chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a
514	pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.
514	""
514	Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being
514	plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet
514	mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old
514	Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she
514	never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very
514	much in her way.  She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,
514	gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,
514	funny, or thoughtful.  Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it
514	was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way.  Round shoulders
514	had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the
514	uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a
514	woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her,
514	was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy
514	manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom
514	disturbed.  Her father called her 'Little Miss Tranquility', and the
514	name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of
514	her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.
514	Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own
514	opinion at least.  A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow
514	hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying
514	herself like a young lady mindful of her manners.  What the characters
514	of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.
514	""
514	The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair
514	of slippers down to warm.  Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a
514	good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone
514	brightened to welcome her.  Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the
514	lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot
514	how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the
514	blaze.
514	""
514	"""They are quite worn out.  Marmee must have a new pair."""
514	""
514	"""I thought I'd get her some with my dollar,"" said Beth."
514	""
514	"""No, I shall!"" cried Amy."
514	""
514	"""I'm the oldest,"" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, ""I'm the man"
514	of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for
514	"he told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone."""
514	""
514	"""I'll tell you what we'll do,"" said Beth, ""let's each get her something"
514	"for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves."""
514	""
514	"""That's like you, dear!  What will we get?"" exclaimed Jo."
514	""
514	Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the
514	"idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, ""I shall give"
514	"her a nice pair of gloves."""
514	""
514	"""Army shoes, best to be had,"" cried Jo."
514	""
514	"""Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,"" said Beth."
514	""
514	"""I'll get a little bottle of cologne.  She likes it, and it won't cost"
514	"much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,"" added Amy."
514	""
514	"""How will we give the things?"" asked Meg."
514	""
514	"""Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles."
514	"Don't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?"" answered Jo."
514	""
514	"""I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair"
514	with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the
514	presents, with a kiss.  I liked the things and the kisses, but it was
514	"dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,"""
514	said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same
514	time.
514	""
514	"""Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then"
514	surprise her.  We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so
514	"much to do about the play for Christmas night,"" said Jo, marching up"
514	and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.
514	""
514	"""I don't mean to act any more after this time.  I'm getting too old for"
514	"such things,"" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about"
514	'dressing-up' frolics.
514	""
514	"""You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown"
514	with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best
514	actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the
514	"boards,"" said Jo.  ""We ought to rehearse tonight.  Come here, Amy, and"
514	"do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that."""
514	""
514	"""I can't help it.  I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose to make"
514	myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.  If I can go down
514	easily, I'll drop.  If I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be
514	"graceful.  I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,"""
514	returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen
514	because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain
514	of the piece.
514	""
514	"""Do it this way.  Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,"
514	"crying frantically, 'Roderigo! Save me! Save me!'"" and away went Jo,"
514	with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.
514	""
514	Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and
514	"jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her ""Ow!"" was"
514	more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish.
514	Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let
514	"her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. ""It's no use!  Do"
514	the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don't
514	"blame me.  Come on, Meg."""
514	""
514	Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech
514	of two pages without a single break.  Hagar, the witch, chanted an
514	awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird
514	effect.  Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in
514	"agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, ""Ha! Ha!"""
514	""
514	"""It's the best we've had yet,"" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and"
514	rubbed his elbows.
514	""
514	"""I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo."
514	"You're a regular Shakespeare!"" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that"
514	her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.
514	""
514	"""Not quite,"" replied Jo modestly.  ""I do think _The Witches Curse, an"
514	Operatic Tragedy_ is rather a nice thing, but I'd like to try
514	_Macbeth_, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo.  I always wanted to do
514	"the killing part.  'Is that a dagger that I see before me?"" muttered"
514	Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous
514	tragedian do.
514	""
514	"""No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead of the"
514	"bread.  Beth's stage-struck!"" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a"
514	general burst of laughter.
514	""
514	"""Glad to find you so merry, my girls,"" said a cheery voice at the door,"
514	and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a
514	'can I help you' look about her which was truly delightful. She was not
514	elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the
514	gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in
514	the world.
514	""
514	"""Well, dearies, how have you got on today?  There was so much to do,"
514	getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come home to
514	dinner.  Has anyone called, Beth?  How is your cold, Meg?  Jo, you look
514	"tired to death.  Come and kiss me, baby."""
514	""
514	While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things
514	off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy
514	to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day.  The
514	girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own
514	way.  Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs,
514	dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched.  Beth
514	trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy
514	gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.
514	""
514	As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly
514	"happy face, ""I've got a treat for you after supper."""
514	""
514	A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth
514	clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up
514	"her napkin, crying, ""A letter!  A letter!  Three cheers for Father!"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, a nice long letter.  He is well, and thinks he shall get through"
514	the cold season better than we feared.  He sends all sorts of loving
514	"wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,"" said Mrs."
514	March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.
514	""
514	"""Hurry and get done!  Don't stop to quirk your little finger and simper"
514	"over your plate, Amy,"" cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her"
514	bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.
514	""
514	Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood
514	over the delight to come, till the others were ready.
514	""
514	"""I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too"
514	"old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,"" said Meg"
514	warmly.
514	""
514	"""Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan--what's its name?  Or a"
514	"nurse, so I could be near him and help him,"" exclaimed Jo, with a groan."
514	""
514	"""It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of"
514	"bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,"" sighed Amy."
514	""
514	"""When will he come home, Marmee?"" asked Beth, with a little quiver in"
514	her voice.
514	""
514	"""Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.  He will stay and do his"
514	work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a
514	"minute sooner than he can be spared.  Now come and hear the letter."""
514	""
514	They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her
514	feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on
514	the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter
514	should happen to be touching.  Very few letters were written in those
514	hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent
514	home.  In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the
514	dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful,
514	hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and
514	military news, and only at the end did the writer's heart over-flow
514	with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.
514	""
514	"""Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.  Tell them I think of them"
514	by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their
514	affection at all times.  A year seems very long to wait before I see
514	them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these
514	hard days need not be wasted.  I know they will remember all I said to
514	them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty
514	faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves
514	so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and
514	"prouder than ever of my little women."" Everybody sniffed when they came"
514	to that part.  Jo wasn't ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the
514	end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she
514	"hid her face on her mother's shoulder and sobbed out, ""I am a selfish"
514	girl!  But I'll truly try to be better, so he mayn't be disappointed in
514	"me by-and-by."""
514	""
514	"""We all will,"" cried Meg.  ""I think too much of my looks and hate to"
514	"work, but won't any more, if I can help it."""
514	""
514	"""I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman' and not be"
514	rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere
514	"else,"" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much"
514	harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.
514	""
514	Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and
514	began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that
514	lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all
514	that Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy
514	coming home.
514	""
514	Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her
514	"cheery voice, ""Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress"
514	when you were little things?  Nothing delighted you more than to have
514	me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and
514	sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from
514	the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop,
514	where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a
514	"Celestial City."""
514	""
514	"""What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and"
514	"passing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,"" said Jo."
514	""
514	"""I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs,"""
514	said Meg.
514	""
514	"""I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar"
514	and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the
514	top.  If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it
514	"over again,"" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things"
514	at the mature age of twelve.
514	""
514	"""We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are"
514	playing all the time in one way or another.  Our burdens are here, our
514	road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the
514	guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace
514	which is a true Celestial City.  Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you
514	begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can
514	"get before Father comes home."""
514	""
514	"""Really, Mother?  Where are our bundles?"" asked Amy, who was a very"
514	literal young lady.
514	""
514	"""Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather"
514	"think she hasn't got any,"" said her mother."
514	""
514	"""Yes, I have.  Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice"
514	"pianos, and being afraid of people."""
514	""
514	Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but
514	nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.
514	""
514	"""Let us do it,"" said Meg thoughtfully.  ""It is only another name for"
514	trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to
514	"be good, it's hard work and we forget, and don't do our best."""
514	""
514	"""We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled"
514	us out as Help did in the book.  We ought to have our roll of
514	"directions, like Christian.  What shall we do about that?"" asked Jo,"
514	delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull
514	task of doing her duty.
514	""
514	"""Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your"
514	"guidebook,"" replied Mrs. March."
514	""
514	They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then
514	out came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the
514	girls made sheets for Aunt March.  It was uninteresting sewing, but
514	tonight no one grumbled.  They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long
514	seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa,
514	and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they
514	talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through
514	them.
514	""
514	At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed.
514	No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had
514	a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant
514	accompaniment to the simple songs they sang.  Meg had a voice like a
514	flute, and she and her mother led the little choir.  Amy chirped like a
514	cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always
514	coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the
514	most pensive tune.  They had always done this from the time they could
514	lisp...
514	""
514	    Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,
514	""
514	and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.
514	The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the
514	house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same
514	cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar
514	lullaby.
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER TWO
514	""
514	A MERRY CHRISTMAS
514	""
514	Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No
514	stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much
514	disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down
514	because it was crammed so full of goodies.  Then she remembered her
514	mother's promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a
514	little crimson-covered book.  She knew it very well, for it was that
514	beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it
514	was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey.  She woke
514	"Meg with a ""Merry Christmas,"" and bade her see what was under her"
514	pillow.  A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside,
514	and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present
514	very precious in their eyes.  Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage
514	and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and
514	all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy
514	with the coming day.
514	""
514	In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,
514	which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved
514	her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently
514	given.
514	""
514	"""Girls,"" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her"
514	"to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, ""Mother wants"
514	us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once.
514	We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all
514	this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things.  You can
514	do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a
514	little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good
514	"and help me through the day."""
514	""
514	Then she opened her new book and began to read.  Jo put her arm round
514	her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression
514	so seldom seen on her restless face.
514	""
514	"""How good Meg is!  Come, Amy, let's do as they do.  I'll help you with"
514	"the hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,"""
514	whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her
514	sisters' example.
514	""
514	"""I'm glad mine is blue,"" said Amy.  and then the rooms were very still"
514	while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to
514	touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.
514	""
514	"""Where is Mother?"" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for"
514	their gifts, half an hour later.
514	""
514	"""Goodness only knows.  Some poor creeter came a-beggin', and your ma"
514	went straight off to see what was needed.  There never was such a woman
514	"for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',"" replied Hannah,"
514	who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by
514	them all more as a friend than a servant.
514	""
514	"""She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything"
514	"ready,"" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a"
514	basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper
514	"time.  ""Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?"" she added, as the"
514	little flask did not appear.
514	""
514	"""She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on"
514	"it, or some such notion,"" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take"
514	the first stiffness off the new army slippers.
514	""
514	"""How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they?  Hannah washed and ironed"
514	"them for me, and I marked them all myself,"" said Beth, looking proudly"
514	at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.
514	""
514	"""Bless the child!  She's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M."
514	"March'.  How funny!"" cried Jo, taking one up."
514	""
514	"""Isn't that right?  I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's"
514	"initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use these but Marmee,"""
514	said Beth, looking troubled.
514	""
514	"""It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for"
514	"no one can ever mistake now.  It will please her very much, I know,"""
514	said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.
514	""
514	"""There's Mother.  Hide the basket, quick!"" cried Jo, as a door slammed"
514	and steps sounded in the hall.
514	""
514	Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters
514	all waiting for her.
514	""
514	"""Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?"" asked Meg,"
514	surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so
514	early.
514	""
514	"""Don't laugh at me, Jo!  I didn't mean anyone should know till the time"
514	came.  I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I
514	gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any
514	"more."""
514	""
514	As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap
514	one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget
514	herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her 'a
514	trump', while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to
514	ornament the stately bottle.
514	""
514	"""You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about"
514	being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the
514	"minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest now."""
514	""
514	Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the
514	girls to the table, eager for breakfast.
514	""
514	"""Merry Christmas, Marmee!  Many of them!  Thank you for our books.  We"
514	"read some, and mean to every day,"" they all cried in chorus."
514	""
514	"""Merry Christmas, little daughters!  I'm glad you began at once, and"
514	hope you will keep on.  But I want to say one word before we sit down.
514	Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby.
514	Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they
514	have no fire.  There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy
514	came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold.  My girls, will
514	"you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?"""
514	""
514	They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a
514	"minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, ""I'm"
514	"so glad you came before we began!"""
514	""
514	"""May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?"" asked"
514	Beth eagerly.
514	""
514	"""I shall take the cream and the muffings,"" added Amy, heroically giving"
514	up the article she most liked.
514	""
514	Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one
514	big plate.
514	""
514	"""I thought you'd do it,"" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. ""You"
514	shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and
514	"milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime."""
514	""
514	They were soon ready, and the procession set out.  Fortunately it was
514	early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and
514	no one laughed at the queer party.
514	""
514	A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,
514	ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,
514	hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.
514	""
514	How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.
514	""
514	"""Ach, mein Gott!  It is good angels come to us!"" said the poor woman,"
514	crying for joy.
514	""
514	"""Funny angels in hoods and mittens,"" said Jo, and set them to laughing."
514	""
514	In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work
514	there.  Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the
514	broken panes with old hats and her own cloak.  Mrs. March gave the
514	mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while
514	she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own.  The
514	girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and
514	fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to
514	understand the funny broken English.
514	""
514	"""Das ist gut!""  ""Die Engel-kinder!"" cried the poor things as they ate"
514	and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had
514	never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable,
514	especially Jo, who had been considered a 'Sancho' ever since she was
514	born.  That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't get any of
514	it.  And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there
514	were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little
514	girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with
514	bread and milk on Christmas morning.
514	""
514	"""That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,"" said"
514	Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs
514	collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.
514	""
514	Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in
514	the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white
514	chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave
514	quite an elegant air to the table.
514	""
514	"""She's coming!  Strike up, Beth!  Open the door, Amy!  Three cheers for"
514	"Marmee!"" cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to"
514	the seat of honor.
514	""
514	Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted
514	escort with great dignity.  Mrs. March was both surprised and touched,
514	and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the
514	little notes which accompanied them.  The slippers went on at once, a
514	new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's
514	cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were
514	pronounced a perfect fit.
514	""
514	There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the
514	simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at
514	the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to
514	work.
514	""
514	The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of
514	the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities.  Being
514	still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to
514	afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their
514	wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made
514	whatever they needed.  Very clever were some of their productions,
514	pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats
514	covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering
514	with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the
514	same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of
514	preserve pots were cut out.  The big chamber was the scene of many
514	innocent revels.
514	""
514	No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart's
514	content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots
514	given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor.  These boots,
514	an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some
514	picture, were Jo's chief treasures and appeared on all occasions.  The
514	smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors
514	to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit
514	for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,
514	whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage
514	besides.  It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless
514	amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been
514	idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.
514	""
514	On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the
514	dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a
514	most flattering state of expectancy.  There was a good deal of rustling
514	and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an
514	occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the
514	excitement of the moment.  Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew
514	apart, and the _operatic tragedy_ began.
514	""
514	"""A gloomy wood,"" according to the one playbill, was represented by a"
514	few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the
514	distance.  This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof, bureaus
514	for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black
514	pot on it and an old witch bending over it.  The stage was dark and the
514	glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued
514	from the kettle when the witch took off the cover.  A moment was
514	allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain,
514	stalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black
514	beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots.  After pacing to and fro in
514	much agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain,
514	singing of his hatred for Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing
514	resolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's
514	voice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were
514	very impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused for
514	breath.  Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he
514	stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding,
514	"""What ho, minion! I need thee!"""
514	""
514	Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and
514	black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak.  Hugo
514	demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo.
514	Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call
514	up the spirit who would bring the love philter.
514	""
514	    Hither, hither, from thy home,
514	    Airy sprite, I bid thee come!
514	    Born of roses, fed on dew,
514	    Charms and potions canst thou brew?
514	    Bring me here, with elfin speed,
514	    The fragrant philter which I need.
514	    Make it sweet and swift and strong,
514	    Spirit, answer now my song!
514	""
514	A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave
514	appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden
514	hair, and a garland of roses on its head.  Waving a wand, it sang...
514	""
514	    Hither I come,
514	    From my airy home,
514	    Afar in the silver moon.
514	    Take the magic spell,
514	    And use it well,
514	    Or its power will vanish soon!
514	""
514	And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit
514	vanished.  Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a
514	lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having
514	croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a
514	mocking laugh.  Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his
514	boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he had
514	killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed him, and
514	intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him.  Then the curtain
514	fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the
514	merits of the play.
514	""
514	A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but
514	when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been
514	got up, no one murmured at the delay.  It was truly superb. A tower
514	rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning
514	in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and
514	silver dress, waiting for Roderigo.  He came in gorgeous array, with
514	plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of
514	course.  Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in
514	melting tones.  Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented
514	to fly.  Then came the grand effect of the play.  Roderigo produced a
514	rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara
514	to descend.  Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on
514	"Roderigo's shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when ""Alas!"
514	"Alas for Zara!"" she forgot her train.  It caught in the window, the"
514	tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the
514	unhappy lovers in the ruins.
514	""
514	A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the
514	"wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, ""I told you so!  I told"
514	"you so!""  With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire,"
514	rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside...
514	""
514	"""Don't laugh!  Act as if it was all right!"" and, ordering Roderigo up,"
514	banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly
514	shaken by the fall from the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old
514	gentleman and refused to stir.  This dauntless example fired Zara.  She
514	also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons
514	of the castle.  A stout little retainer came in with chains and led
514	them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the
514	speech he ought to have made.
514	""
514	Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to
514	free the lovers and finish Hugo.  She hears him coming and hides, sees
514	him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little
514	"servant, ""Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I"
514	"shall come anon.""  The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something,"
514	and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless.
514	Ferdinando, the 'minion', carries them away, and Hagar puts back the
514	cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty
514	after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal
514	of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him
514	what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.
514	""
514	This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have
514	thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair
514	rather marred the effect of the villain's death.  He was called before
514	the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose
514	singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the
514	performance put together.
514	""
514	Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing
514	himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as
514	the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,
514	informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if
514	he will.  A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of
514	rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his
514	lady love.
514	""
514	Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He
514	wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it, and after a
514	touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands
514	her hand.  Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and
514	gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear
514	away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter
514	and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared.  The latter
514	informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair
514	and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy.  The bag
514	is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage
514	till it is quite glorified with the glitter.  This entirely softens the
514	stern sire.  He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus,
514	and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's
514	blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.
514	""
514	Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the
514	cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut up and
514	extinguished the enthusiastic audience.  Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to
514	the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless
514	with laughter.  The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah
514	"appeared, with ""Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk"
514	"down to supper."""
514	""
514	This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table,
514	they looked at one another in rapturous amazement.  It was like Marmee
514	to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was
514	unheard of since the departed days of plenty.  There was ice cream,
514	actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and
514	distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great
514	bouquets of hot house flowers.
514	""
514	It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and
514	then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.
514	""
514	"""Is it fairies?"" asked Amy."
514	""
514	"""Santa Claus,"" said Beth."
514	""
514	"""Mother did it."" And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray"
514	beard and white eyebrows.
514	""
514	"""Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,"" cried Jo, with a"
514	sudden inspiration.
514	""
514	"""All wrong.  Old Mr. Laurence sent it,"" replied Mrs. March."
514	""
514	"""The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing"
514	"into his head?  We don't know him!"" exclaimed Meg."
514	""
514	"""Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an"
514	odd old gentleman, but that pleased him.  He knew my father years ago,
514	and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would
514	allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending
514	them a few trifles in honor of the day.  I could not refuse, and so you
514	have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk
514	"breakfast."""
514	""
514	"""That boy put it into his head, I know he did!  He's a capital fellow,"
514	and I wish we could get acquainted.  He looks as if he'd like to know
514	us but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him
514	"when we pass,"" said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to"
514	melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.
514	""
514	"""You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?"""
514	"asked one of the girls.  ""My mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says"
514	he's very proud and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps
514	his grandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor,
514	and makes him study very hard.  We invited him to our party, but he
514	didn't come.  Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us
514	"girls."""
514	""
514	"""Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the"
514	fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on,
514	when he saw Meg coming, and walked off.  I mean to know him some day,
514	"for he needs fun, I'm sure he does,"" said Jo decidedly."
514	""
514	"""I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so I've no"
514	objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He
514	brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if I had
514	been sure what was going on upstairs.  He looked so wistful as he went
514	"away, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own."""
514	""
514	"""It's a mercy you didn't, Mother!"" laughed Jo, looking at her boots."
514	"""But we'll have another play sometime that he can see.  Perhaps he'll"
514	"help act.  Wouldn't that be jolly?"""
514	""
514	"""I never had such a fine bouquet before!  How pretty it is!"" And Meg"
514	examined her flowers with great interest.
514	""
514	"""They are lovely.  But Beth's roses are sweeter to me,"" said Mrs."
514	March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.
514	""
514	"Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, ""I wish I could send my"
514	bunch to Father.  I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as
514	"we are."""

514	CHAPTER THREE
514	""
514	THE LAURENCE BOY
514	""
514	"""Jo!  Jo!  Where are you?"" cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs."
514	""
514	"""Here!"" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found"
514	her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped
514	up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window.
514	This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a
514	dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a
514	pet rat who lived near by and didn't mind her a particle.  As Meg
514	appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole.  Jo shook the tears off her
514	cheeks and waited to hear the news.
514	""
514	"""Such fun!  Only see!  A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner"
514	"for tomorrow night!"" cried Meg, waving the precious paper and then"
514	proceeding to read it with girlish delight.
514	""
514	"""'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at"
514	a little dance on New Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go, now
514	"what shall we wear?"""
514	""
514	"""What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our"
514	"poplins, because we haven't got anything else?"" answered Jo with her"
514	mouth full.
514	""
514	"""If I only had a silk!"" sighed Meg.  ""Mother says I may when I'm"
514	"eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait."""
514	""
514	"""I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us."
514	Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.
514	"Whatever shall I do?  The burn shows badly, and I can't take any out."""
514	""
514	"""You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The"
514	front is all right.  I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee
514	will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and
514	"my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like."""
514	""
514	"""Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I"
514	"shall have to go without,"" said Jo, who never troubled herself much"
514	about dress.
514	""
514	"""You must have gloves, or I won't go,"" cried Meg decidedly. ""Gloves are"
514	more important than anything else.  You can't dance without them, and
514	"if you don't I should be so mortified."""
514	""
514	"""Then I'll stay still.  I don't care much for company dancing. It's no"
514	"fun to go sailing round.  I like to fly about and cut capers."""
514	""
514	"""You can't ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are"
514	so careless.  She said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn't
514	"get you any more this winter.  Can't you make them do?"""
514	""
514	"""I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how"
514	stained they are.  That's all I can do.  No!  I'll tell you how we can
514	"manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one.  Don't you see?"""
514	""
514	"""Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove"
514	"dreadfully,"" began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her."
514	""
514	"""Then I'll go without.  I don't care what people say!"" cried Jo, taking"
514	up her book.
514	""
514	"""You may have it, you may!  Only don't stain it, and do behave nicely."
514	Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say 'Christopher
514	"Columbus!' will you?"""
514	""
514	"""Don't worry about me.  I'll be as prim as I can and not get into any"
514	scrapes, if I can help it.  Now go and answer your note, and let me
514	"finish this splendid story."""
514	""
514	So Meg went away to 'accept with thanks', look over her dress, and sing
514	blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her
514	story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.
514	""
514	On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls
514	played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the
514	all-important business of 'getting ready for the party'.  Simple as the
514	toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing
514	and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the
514	house.  Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to
514	pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.
514	""
514	"""Ought they to smoke like that?"" asked Beth from her perch on the bed."
514	""
514	"""It's the dampness drying,"" replied Jo."
514	""
514	"""What a queer smell!  It's like burned feathers,"" observed Amy,"
514	smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.
514	""
514	"""There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little"
514	"ringlets,"" said Jo, putting down the tongs."
514	""
514	She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the
514	hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of
514	little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.
514	""
514	"""Oh, oh, oh! What have you done?  I'm spoiled!  I can't go!  My hair,"
514	"oh, my hair!"" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on"
514	her forehead.
514	""
514	"""Just my luck!  You shouldn't have asked me to do it.  I always spoil"
514	everything.  I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made
514	"a mess,"" groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with"
514	tears of regret.
514	""
514	"""It isn't spoiled.  Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends"
514	come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion.
514	"I've seen many girls do it so,"" said Amy consolingly."
514	""
514	"""Serves me right for trying to be fine.  I wish I'd let my hair alone,"""
514	cried Meg petulantly.
514	""
514	"""So do I, it was so smooth and pretty.  But it will soon grow out"
514	"again,"" said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep."
514	""
514	After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the
514	united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up and her
514	dress on.  They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg's in
514	silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin.
514	Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white
514	chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light
514	"glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect ""quite"
514	"easy and fine"".  Meg's high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt"
514	her, though she would not own it, and Jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed
514	stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but,
514	dear me, let us be elegant or die.
514	""
514	"""Have a good time, dearies!"" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went"
514	"daintily down the walk.  ""Don't eat much supper, and come away at"
514	"eleven when I send Hannah for you.""  As the gate clashed behind them, a"
514	voice cried from a window...
514	""
514	"""Girls, girls!  Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,"" cried Jo, adding"
514	"with a laugh as they went on, ""I do believe Marmee would ask that if we"
514	"were all running away from an earthquake."""
514	""
514	"""It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real"
514	"lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,"" replied"
514	Meg, who had a good many little 'aristocratic tastes' of her own.
514	""
514	"""Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash"
514	"right?  And does my hair look very bad?"" said Meg, as she turned from"
514	the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a prolonged prink.
514	""
514	"""I know I shall forget.  If you see me doing anything wrong, just"
514	"remind me by a wink, will you?"" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch"
514	and her head a hasty brush.
514	""
514	"""No, winking isn't ladylike.  I'll lift my eyebrows if any thing is"
514	wrong, and nod if you are all right.  Now hold your shoulder straight,
514	and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to
514	"anyone.  It isn't the thing."""
514	""
514	"""How do you learn all the proper ways?  I never can.  Isn't that music"
514	"gay?"""
514	""
514	Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to
514	parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to
514	them.  Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and
514	handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie
514	and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't care much for girls
514	or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the
514	wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden.  Half
514	a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the
514	room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the
514	joys of her life.  She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows
514	went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir.  No one came to talk to
514	her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone.
514	She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth
514	would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing
514	began.  Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so
514	briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered
514	smilingly.  Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and
514	fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess,
514	intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace.  Unfortunately, another
514	bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell
514	behind her, she found herself face to face with the 'Laurence boy'.
514	""
514	"""Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here!"" stammered Jo, preparing to"
514	back out as speedily as she had bounced in.
514	""
514	But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little
514	"startled, ""Don't mind me, stay if you like."""
514	""
514	"""Shan't I disturb you?"""
514	""
514	"""Not a bit.  I only came here because I don't know many people and felt"
514	"rather strange at first, you know."""
514	""
514	"""So did I.  Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather."""
514	""
514	The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to
514	"be polite and easy, ""I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you"
514	"before.  You live near us, don't you?"""
514	""
514	"""Next door.""  And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim"
514	manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about
514	cricket when he brought the cat home.
514	""
514	That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her
514	"heartiest way, ""We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas"
514	"present."""
514	""
514	"""Grandpa sent it."""
514	""
514	"""But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?"""
514	""
514	"""How is your cat, Miss March?"" asked the boy, trying to look sober"
514	while his black eyes shone with fun.
514	""
514	"""Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence.  But I am not Miss March, I'm only"
514	"Jo,"" returned the young lady."
514	""
514	"""I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie."""
514	""
514	"""Laurie Laurence, what an odd name."""
514	""
514	"""My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called"
514	"me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead."""
514	""
514	"""I hate my name, too, so sentimental!  I wish every one would say Jo"
514	"instead of Josephine.  How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?"""
514	""
514	"""I thrashed 'em."""
514	""
514	"""I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.""  And"
514	Jo resigned herself with a sigh.
514	""
514	"""Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?"" asked Laurie, looking as if he"
514	thought the name suited her.
514	""
514	"""I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is"
514	lively.  In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on
514	people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and
514	"let Meg sail about.  Don't you dance?"""
514	""
514	"""Sometimes.  You see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't"
514	"been into company enough yet to know how you do things here."""
514	""
514	"""Abroad!"" cried Jo.  ""Oh, tell me about it!  I love dearly to hear"
514	"people describe their travels."""
514	""
514	Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager questions
514	soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay,
514	where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake,
514	and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their
514	teachers.
514	""
514	"""Don't I wish I'd been there!"" cried Jo.  ""Did you go to Paris?"""
514	""
514	"""We spent last winter there."""
514	""
514	"""Can you talk French?"""
514	""
514	"""We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay."""
514	""
514	"""Do say some!  I can read it, but can't pronounce."""
514	""
514	"""Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?"""
514	""
514	"""How nicely you do it!  Let me see ... you said, 'Who is the young lady"
514	"in the pretty slippers', didn't you?"""
514	""
514	"""Oui, mademoiselle."""
514	""
514	"""It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was!  Do you think she is"
514	"pretty?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and"
514	"quiet, and dances like a lady."""
514	""
514	Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and
514	stored it up to repeat to Meg.  Both peeped and criticized and chatted
514	till they felt like old acquaintances.  Laurie's bashfulness soon wore
514	off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and
514	Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody
514	lifted their eyebrows at her.  She liked the 'Laurence boy' better than
514	ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him
514	to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys
514	were almost unknown creatures to them.
514	""
514	"""Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine"
514	teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy,
514	"and altogether jolly.  Wonder how old he is?"""
514	""
514	It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked herself in
514	time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.
514	""
514	"""I suppose you are going to college soon?  I see you pegging away at"
514	"your books, no, I mean studying hard.""  And Jo blushed at the dreadful"
514	'pegging' which had escaped her.
514	""
514	"Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a shrug.  ""Not"
514	"for a year or two.  I won't go before seventeen, anyway."""
514	""
514	"""Aren't you but fifteen?"" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she"
514	had imagined seventeen already.
514	""
514	"""Sixteen, next month."""
514	""
514	"""How I wish I was going to college!  You don't look as if you liked it."""
514	""
514	"""I hate it!  Nothing but grinding or skylarking.  And I don't like the"
514	"way fellows do either, in this country."""
514	""
514	"""What do you like?"""
514	""
514	"""To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way."""
514	""
514	Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows
514	looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject
514	"by saying, as her foot kept time, ""That's a splendid polka!  Why don't"
514	"you go and try it?"""
514	""
514	"""If you will come too,"" he answered, with a gallant little bow."
514	""
514	"""I can't, for I told Meg I wouldn't, because..."" There Jo stopped, and"
514	looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.
514	""
514	"""Because, what?"""
514	""
514	"""You won't tell?"""
514	""
514	"""Never!"""
514	""
514	"""Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my"
514	frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely mended, it
514	shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it.  You may
514	"laugh, if you want to.  It is funny, I know."""
514	""
514	But Laurie didn't laugh.  He only looked down a minute, and the
514	"expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, ""Never mind"
514	that.  I'll tell you how we can manage.  There's a long hall out there,
514	"and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come."""
514	""
514	Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when
514	she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore.  The hall was
514	empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught
514	her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and
514	spring.  When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get
514	their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students'
514	festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister.  She
514	beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she
514	found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.
514	""
514	"""I've sprained my ankle.  That stupid high heel turned and gave me a"
514	sad wrench.  It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm
514	"ever going to get home,"" she said, rocking to and fro in pain."
514	""
514	"""I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes.  I'm sorry.  But I"
514	don't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all
514	"night,"" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke."
514	""
514	"""I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much.  I dare say"
514	I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it's a
514	"long way to the stable, and no one to send."""
514	""
514	"""I'll go."""
514	""
514	"""No, indeed!  It's past nine, and dark as Egypt.  I can't stop here,"
514	for the house is full.  Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll
514	"rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can."""
514	""
514	"""I'll ask Laurie.  He will go,"" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea"
514	occurred to her.
514	""
514	"""Mercy, no!  Don't ask or tell anyone.  Get me my rubbers, and put"
514	these slippers with our things.  I can't dance anymore, but as soon as
514	"supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes."""
514	""
514	"""They are going out to supper now.  I'll stay with you.  I'd rather."""
514	""
514	"""No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee.  I'm so tired I can't"
514	"stir."""
514	""
514	So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away
514	to the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet,
514	and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a
514	little private refreshment.  Making a dart at the table, she secured
514	the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of
514	her dress as bad as the back.
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!"" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's"
514	glove by scrubbing her gown with it.
514	""
514	"""Can I help you?"" said a friendly voice.  And there was Laurie, with a"
514	full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.
514	""
514	"""I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone"
514	"shook me, and here I am in a nice state,"" answered Jo, glancing"
514	dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.
514	""
514	"""Too bad!   I was looking for someone to give this to.  May I take it"
514	"to your sister?"""
514	""
514	"""Oh, thank you!  I'll show you where she is.  I don't offer to take it"
514	"myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did."""
514	""
514	Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a
514	little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo,
514	and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a 'nice
514	boy'.  They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in
514	the midst of a quiet game of _Buzz_, with two or three other young
514	people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared.  Meg forgot her foot
514	and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an
514	exclamation of pain.
514	""
514	"""Hush!  Don't say anything,"" she whispered, adding aloud, ""It's"
514	"nothing.  I turned my foot a little, that's all,"" and limped upstairs"
514	to put her things on.
514	""
514	Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she
514	decided to take things into her own hands.  Slipping out, she ran down
514	and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It
514	happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood
514	and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she
514	said, came up and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just
514	come for him, he said.
514	""
514	"""It's so early!  You can't mean to go yet?"" began Jo, looking relieved"
514	but hesitating to accept the offer.
514	""
514	"""I always go early, I do, truly!  Please let me take you home. It's all"
514	"on my way, you know, and it rains, they say."""
514	""
514	That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully
514	accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.  Hannah
514	hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they
514	rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and
514	elegant.  Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the
514	girls talked over their party in freedom.
514	""
514	"""I had a capital time.  Did you?"" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and"
514	making herself comfortable.
514	""
514	"""Yes, till I hurt myself.  Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy"
514	to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does.
514	She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be
514	"perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,"" answered Meg, cheering"
514	up at the thought.
514	""
514	"""I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from.  Was he"
514	"nice?"""
514	""
514	"""Oh, very!  His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and I"
514	"had a delicious redowa with him."""
514	""
514	"""He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. Laurie"
514	"and I couldn't help laughing.  Did you hear us?"""
514	""
514	"""No, but it was very rude.  What were you about all that time, hidden"
514	"away there?"""
514	""
514	Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at
514	home.  With many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to
514	disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little
514	nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...
514	""
514	"""Tell about the party!  Tell about the party!"""
514	""
514	With what Meg called 'a great want of manners' Jo had saved some
514	bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing the
514	most thrilling events of the evening.
514	""
514	"""I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home"
514	from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to
514	"wait on me,"" said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed"
514	her hair.
514	""
514	"""I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we"
514	do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight
514	"slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them."""
514	And I think Jo was quite right.
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER FOUR
514	""
514	BURDENS
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,"""
514	sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over,
514	the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the
514	task she never liked.
514	""
514	"""I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time. Wouldn't it be"
514	"fun?"" answered Jo, yawning dismally."
514	""
514	"""We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does"
514	seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties,
514	and drive home, and read and rest, and not work.  It's like other
514	people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I'm so
514	"fond of luxury,"" said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns"
514	was the least shabby.
514	""
514	"""Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but shoulder our"
514	bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does.  I'm sure Aunt
514	March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've
514	learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get
514	"so light that I shan't mind her."""
514	""
514	This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg
514	didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children,
514	seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to make herself
514	pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair
514	in the most becoming way.
514	""
514	"""Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross"
514	"midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?"" she muttered,"
514	"shutting her drawer with a jerk.  ""I shall have to toil and moil all my"
514	days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly
514	and sour, because I'm poor and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.
514	"It's a shame!"""
514	""
514	So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable
514	at breakfast time.  Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to
514	croak.
514	""
514	Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with
514	the cat and three kittens.  Amy was fretting because her lessons were
514	not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers.  Jo would whistle and
514	make a great racket getting ready.
514	""
514	Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at
514	once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn't suit her.
514	""
514	"""There never was such a cross family!"" cried Jo, losing her temper when"
514	she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings, and sat down upon
514	her hat.
514	""
514	"""You're the crossest person in it!"" returned Amy, washing out the sum"
514	that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate.
514	""
514	"""Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them"
514	"drowned,"" exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten"
514	which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.
514	""
514	Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because she
514	couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.
514	""
514	"""Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute!  I must get this off by the"
514	"early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,"" cried Mrs."
514	March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.
514	""
514	There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two
514	hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers were
514	an institution, and the girls called them 'muffs', for they had no
514	others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold
514	mornings.
514	""
514	Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she
514	might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got no other
514	lunch and were seldom home before two.
514	""
514	"""Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye, Marmee."
514	We are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home regular
514	"angels.  Now then, Meg!""  And Jo tramped away, feeling that the"
514	pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.
514	""
514	They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was
514	always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.
514	Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without
514	that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that
514	motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.
514	""
514	"""If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would"
514	serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never
514	"seen,"" cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and"
514	bitter wind.
514	""
514	"""Don't use such dreadful expressions,"" replied Meg from the depths of"
514	the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.
514	""
514	"""I like good strong words that mean something,"" replied Jo, catching"
514	her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away
514	altogether.
514	""
514	"""Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a"
514	"wretch and I don't choose to be called so."""
514	""
514	"""You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can't"
514	sit in the lap of luxury all the time.  Poor dear, just wait till I
514	make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and
514	"high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with."""
514	""
514	"""How ridiculous you are, Jo!""  But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt"
514	better in spite of herself.
514	""
514	"""Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be"
514	dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can
514	always find something funny to keep me up.  Don't croak any more, but
514	"come home jolly, there's a dear."""
514	""
514	Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted
514	for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm
514	turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,
514	hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.
514	""
514	When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate
514	friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something
514	toward their own support, at least.  Believing that they could not
514	begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their
514	parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good will
514	which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.
514	""
514	Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her
514	small salary.  As she said, she was 'fond of luxury', and her chief
514	trouble was poverty.  She found it harder to bear than the others
514	because she could remember a time when home was beautiful, life full of
514	ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown.  She tried not to be
514	envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl
514	should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a
514	happy life.  At the Kings' she daily saw all she wanted, for the
514	children's older sisters were just out, and Meg caught frequent
514	glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about
514	theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds,
514	and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to
514	her.  Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her
514	feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned to
514	know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.
514	""
514	Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active
514	person to wait upon her.  The childless old lady had offered to adopt
514	one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because
514	her offer was declined.  Other friends told the Marches that they had
514	lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will, but
514	the unworldly Marches only said...
514	""
514	"""We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes.  Rich or poor, we"
514	"will keep together and be happy in one another."""
514	""
514	The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet
514	Jo at a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt manners
514	struck the old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her for a
514	companion.  This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the place
514	since nothing better appeared and, to every one's surprise, got on
514	remarkably well with her irascible relative.  There was an occasional
514	tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn't bear it
514	longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent for her to
514	come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse, for in her
514	heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.
514	""
514	I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,
514	which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died.  Jo
514	remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads
514	and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about queer
514	pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever
514	he met her in the street.  The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring
514	down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of
514	all, the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked,
514	made the library a region of bliss to her.
514	""
514	The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with company, Jo
514	hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy chair,
514	devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures like a regular
514	bookworm.  But, like all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure
514	as she had just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of a
514	song, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a shrill voice
514	"called, ""Josy-phine! Josy-phine!"" and she had to leave her paradise to"
514	wind yarn, wash the poodle, or read Belsham's Essays by the hour
514	together.
514	""
514	Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid.  What it was, she had
514	no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and meanwhile, found
514	her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and
514	ride as much as she liked.  A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless
514	spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series
514	of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training
514	she received at Aunt March's was just what she needed, and the thought
514	that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite
514	"of the perpetual ""Josy-phine!"""
514	""
514	Beth was too bashful to go to school.  It had been tried, but she
514	suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home
514	with her father.  Even when he went away, and her mother was called to
514	devote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went
514	faithfully on by herself and did the best she could.  She was a
514	housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and
514	comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be
514	loved.  Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little
514	world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy
514	bee.  There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning,
514	for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever.  Not one
514	whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them
514	in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her
514	because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the
514	more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm
514	dolls.  No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh
514	words or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart
514	of the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and
514	caressed with an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of
514	dollanity had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was
514	left a wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued
514	by Beth and taken to her refuge.  Having no top to its head, she tied
514	on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid
514	these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed
514	to this chronic invalid.  If anyone had known the care lavished on that
514	dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they
514	laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out
514	to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies and
514	never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering
514	"tenderly, ""I hope you'll have a good night, my poor dear."""
514	""
514	Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but
514	a very human little girl, she often 'wept a little weep' as Jo said,
514	because she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine piano.  She
514	loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so
514	patiently at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if
514	someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her.  Nobody did,
514	however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that
514	wouldn't keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang like a little
514	lark about her work, never was too tired for Marmee and the girls, and
514	"day after day said hopefully to herself, ""I know I'll get my music some"
514	"time, if I'm good."""
514	""
514	There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners
514	till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the
514	sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and
514	the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow
514	behind.
514	""
514	If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she
514	"would have answered at once, ""My nose.""  When she was a baby, Jo had"
514	accidently dropped her into the coal hod, and Amy insisted that the
514	fall had ruined her nose forever.  It was not big nor red, like poor
514	'Petrea's', it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world
514	could not give it an aristocratic point.  No one minded it but herself,
514	and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a
514	Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.
514	""
514	"""Little Raphael,"" as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for"
514	drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing
514	fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art.  Her
514	teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her
514	slate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps
514	on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering
514	out of all her books at unlucky moments.  She got through her lessons
514	as well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model
514	of deportment.  She was a great favorite with her mates, being
514	good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.
514	Her little airs and graces were much admired, so were her
514	accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,
514	crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of
514	"the words.  She had a plaintive way of saying, ""When Papa was rich we"
514	"did so-and-so,"" which was very touching, and her long words were"
514	considered 'perfectly elegant' by the girls.
514	""
514	Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and her
514	small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,
514	however, rather quenched the vanities.  She had to wear her cousin's
514	clothes.  Now Florence's mama hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy
514	suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,
514	unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit.  Everything was
514	good, well made, and little worn, but Amy's artistic eyes were much
514	afflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull
514	purple with yellow dots and no trimming.
514	""
514	"""My only comfort,"" she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, ""is that"
514	Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria
514	Parks's mother does.  My dear, it's really dreadful, for sometimes she
514	is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can't come to school.
514	When I think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my
514	"flat nose and purple gown with yellow sky-rockets on it."""
514	""
514	Meg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and by some strange attraction of
514	opposites Jo was gentle Beth's.  To Jo alone did the shy child tell her
514	thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously
514	exercised more influence than anyone in the family.  The two older
514	girls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the
514	younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way,
514	'playing mother' they called it, and put their sisters in the places of
514	discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.
514	""
514	"""Has anybody got anything to tell?  It's been such a dismal day I'm"
514	"really dying for some amusement,"" said Meg, as they sat sewing together"
514	that evening.
514	""
514	"""I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I'll"
514	"tell you about it,"" began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories.  ""I was"
514	reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for
514	Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like
514	fury till she wakes up.  I actually made myself sleepy, and before she
514	began to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by
514	"opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once."""
514	""
514	"""I wish I could, and be done with it,"" said I, trying not to be saucy."
514	""
514	"""Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and"
514	think them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She never
514	finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob like a
514	top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the _Vicar of Wakefield_ out of my pocket,
514	and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. I'd just got to
514	where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out
514	loud.  Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me
514	to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy
514	and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though
514	she only said...
514	""
514	"""'I don't understand what it's all about.  Go back and begin it,"
514	"child.'"""
514	""
514	"""Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could."
514	Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,
514	"'I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am.  Shan't I stop now?'"""
514	""
514	"""She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave"
514	me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way, 'Finish
514	"the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss'."""
514	""
514	"""Did she own she liked it?"" asked Meg."
514	""
514	"""Oh, bless you, no!  But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran back"
514	after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar
514	that she didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of
514	the good time coming.  What a pleasant life she might have if only she
514	chose!  I don't envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all
514	"rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,"" added Jo."
514	""
514	"""That reminds me,"" said Meg, ""that I've got something to tell. It isn't"
514	funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came
514	home.  At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of
514	the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful,
514	and Papa had sent him away.  I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King
514	talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when
514	they passed me, so I shouldn't see how red and swollen their eyes were.
514	I didn't ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and
514	was rather glad I hadn't any wild brothers to do wicked things and
514	"disgrace the family."""
514	""
514	"""I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try_inger_ than"
514	"anything bad boys can do,"" said Amy, shaking her head, as if her"
514	"experience of life had been a deep one.  ""Susie Perkins came to school"
514	today with a lovely red carnelian ring.  I wanted it dreadfully, and
514	wished I was her with all my might.  Well, she drew a picture of Mr.
514	Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, 'Young ladies,
514	my eye is upon you!' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing.  We
514	were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye _was_ on us, and he
514	ordered Susie to bring up her slate.  She was _parry_lized with fright,
514	but she went, and oh, what _do_ you think he did?  He took her by the
514	ear--the ear!  Just fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation
514	platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so
514	"everyone could see."""
514	""
514	"""Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?"" asked Jo, who relished the"
514	scrape.
514	""
514	"""Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know"
514	she did.  I didn't envy her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian
514	rings wouldn't have made me happy after that. I never, never should
514	"have got over such a agonizing mortification."" And Amy went on with her"
514	work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance
514	of two long words in a breath.
514	""
514	"""I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at"
514	"dinner, but I forgot,"" said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in"
514	"order as she talked.  ""When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr."
514	Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn't see me, for I kept behind
514	the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fish-man. A poor
514	woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would
514	let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any
514	dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a day's work.
514	Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said 'No', rather crossly, so she was
514	going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big
514	fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her.  She was
514	so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him
514	over and over.  He told her to 'go along and cook it', and she hurried
514	off, so happy!  Wasn't it good of him?  Oh, she did look so funny,
514	hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven
514	"would be 'aisy'."""
514	""
514	When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one,
514	"and after a moments thought, she said soberly, ""As I sat cutting out"
514	blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about
514	Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything
514	happened to him.  It was not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying
514	till an old man came in with an order for some clothes.  He sat down
514	near me, and I began to talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and
514	anxious.
514	""
514	"""'Have you sons in the army?' I asked, for the note he brought was not"
514	"to me."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, ma'am.  I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and"
514	I'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.' he
514	"answered quietly."""
514	""
514	"""'You have done a great deal for your country, sir,' I said, feeling"
514	"respect now, instead of pity."""
514	""
514	"""'Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am.  I'd go myself, if I was any"
514	"use.  As I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'"""
514	""
514	"""He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give"
514	his all, that I was ashamed of myself.  I'd given one man and thought
514	it too much, while he gave four without grudging them.  I had all my
514	girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting, miles away,
514	to say good-by to him, perhaps!  I felt so rich, so happy thinking of
514	my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and
514	"thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me."""
514	""
514	"""Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this. I like"
514	"to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy,"""
514	said Jo, after a minute's silence.
514	""
514	Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this
514	little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.
514	""
514	"""Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and"
514	drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and
514	"parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented."" (Here"
514	the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew
514	"diligently.) ""These girls were anxious to be good and made many"
514	excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were
514	constantly saying, 'If only we had this,' or 'If we could only do
514	that,' quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things
514	they actually could do.  So they asked an old woman what spell they
514	could use to make them happy, and she said, 'When you feel
514	"discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.'"" (Here Jo"
514	looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing
514	that the story was not done yet.)
514	""
514	"""Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were"
514	surprised to see how well off they were.  One discovered that money
514	couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses, another
514	that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her
514	youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old
514	lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable as it
514	was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for it and
514	the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good
514	behavior.  So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings
514	already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken
514	away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe they were never
514	"disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman's advice."""
514	""
514	"""Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories"
514	"against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!"" cried Meg."
514	""
514	"""I like that kind of sermon.  It's the sort Father used to tell us,"""
514	said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's cushion.
514	""
514	"""I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more"
514	"careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susie's downfall,"""
514	said Amy morally.
514	""
514	"""We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it.  If we do so, you just"
514	say to us, as old Chloe did in _Uncle Tom_, 'Tink ob yer marcies,
514	"chillen!' 'Tink ob yer marcies!'"" added Jo, who could not, for the life"
514	of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though
514	she took it to heart as much as any of them.
514	""
514	""

514	CHAPTER FIVE
514	""
514	BEING NEIGHBORLY
514	""
514	"""What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?"" asked Meg one snowy"
514	afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber
514	boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the
514	other.
514	""
514	"""Going out for exercise,"" answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her"
514	eyes.
514	""
514	"""I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough!"
514	It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the
514	"fire, as I do,"" said Meg with a shiver."
514	""
514	"""Never take advice!  Can't keep still all day, and not being a"
514	pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire.  I like adventures, and I'm
514	"going to find some."""
514	""
514	Meg went back to toast her feet and read _Ivanhoe_, and Jo began to dig
514	paths with great energy.  The snow was light, and with her broom she
514	soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the
514	sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air.  Now, the garden
514	separated the Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence.  Both stood in
514	a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and
514	lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets.  A low hedge parted the two
514	estates.  On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and
514	shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the
514	flowers, which then surrounded it.  On the other side was a stately
514	stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury,
514	from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and
514	the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.
514	""
514	Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children
514	frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and
514	few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.
514	""
514	To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted
514	palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed.  She had
514	long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence
514	boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to
514	begin.  Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had
514	planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen
514	lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied
514	a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their
514	garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.
514	""
514	"""That boy is suffering for society and fun,"" she said to herself. ""His"
514	grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all
514	alone.  He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young
514	and lively.  I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman
514	"so!"""
514	""
514	The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always
514	scandalizing Meg by her queer performances.  The plan of 'going over'
514	was not forgotten.  And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to
514	try what could be done.  She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then
514	sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took
514	a survey.  All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out
514	of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a
514	thin hand at the upper window.
514	""
514	"""There he is,"" thought Jo, ""Poor boy!  All alone and sick this dismal"
514	day.  It's a shame!  I'll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and
514	"then say a kind word to him."""
514	""
514	Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a
514	face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes
514	brightened and the mouth began to smile.  Jo nodded and laughed, and
514	flourished her broom as she called out...
514	""
514	"""How do you do?  Are you sick?"""
514	""
514	Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...
514	""
514	"""Better, thank you.  I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week."""
514	""
514	"""I'm sorry.  What do you amuse yourself with?"""
514	""
514	"""Nothing.  It's dull as tombs up here."""
514	""
514	"""Don't you read?"""
514	""
514	"""Not much.  They won't let me."""
514	""
514	"""Can't somebody read to you?"""
514	""
514	"""Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don't interest him, and I hate to"
514	"ask Brooke all the time."""
514	""
514	"""Have someone come and see you then."""
514	""
514	"""There isn't anyone I'd like to see.  Boys make such a row, and my head"
514	"is weak."""
514	""
514	"""Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?  Girls are quiet"
514	"and like to play nurse."""
514	""
514	"""Don't know any."""
514	""
514	"""You know us,"" began Jo, then laughed and stopped."
514	""
514	"""So I do!  Will you come, please?"" cried Laurie."
514	""
514	"""I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me. I'll go"
514	"ask her.  Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come."""
514	""
514	With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house,
514	wondering what they would all say to her.  Laurie was in a flutter of
514	excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready,
514	for as Mrs. March said, he was 'a little gentleman', and did honor to
514	the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh collar,
514	and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen
514	servants, was anything but neat.  Presently there came a loud ring,
514	than a decided voice, asking for 'Mr. Laurie', and a surprised-looking
514	servant came running up to announce a young lady.
514	""
514	"""All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo,"" said Laurie, going to the door"
514	of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite
514	at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three kittens
514	in the other.
514	""
514	"""Here I am, bag and baggage,"" she said briskly.  ""Mother sent her love,"
514	and was glad if I could do anything for you.  Meg wanted me to bring
514	some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her
514	cats would be comforting.  I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't
514	"refuse, she was so anxious to do something."""
514	""
514	It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in
514	laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew
514	sociable at once.
514	""
514	"""That looks too pretty to eat,"" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo"
514	uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland
514	of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.
514	""
514	"""It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it."
514	Tell the girl to put it away for your tea.  It's so simple you can eat
514	it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.
514	"What a cozy room this is!"""
514	""
514	"""It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don't"
514	"know how to make them mind.  It worries me though."""
514	""
514	"""I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth"
514	brushed, so--and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so--and
514	the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from
514	"the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit.  Now then, you're fixed."""
514	""
514	And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things
514	into place and given quite a different air to the room.  Laurie watched
514	her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he
514	sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...
514	""
514	"""How kind you are!  Yes, that's what it wanted.  Now please take the"
514	"big chair and let me do something to amuse my company."""
514	""
514	"""No, I came to amuse you.  Shall I read aloud?"" and Jo looked"
514	affectionately toward some inviting books near by.
514	""
514	"""Thank you!  I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather"
514	"talk,"" answered Laurie."
514	""
514	"""Not a bit.  I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I"
514	"never know when to stop."""
514	""
514	"""Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes"
514	"out with a little basket?"" asked Laurie with interest."
514	""
514	"""Yes, that's Beth.  She's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too."""
514	""
514	"""The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?"""
514	""
514	"""How did you find that out?"""
514	""
514	"Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, ""Why, you see I often hear you"
514	calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help
514	looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good
514	times.  I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget
514	to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when
514	the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire,
514	and you all around the table with your mother.  Her face is right
514	opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help
514	"watching it.  I haven't got any mother, you know."" And Laurie poked the"
514	fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.
514	""
514	The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart.
514	She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,
514	and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child.  Laurie was
514	sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness,
514	she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and
514	her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...
514	""
514	"""We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look"
514	as much as you like.  I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd
514	come over and see us.  Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of
514	good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would
514	dance.  Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties,
514	"and we'd have jolly times.  Wouldn't your grandpa let you?"""
514	""
514	"""I think he would, if your mother asked him.  He's very kind, though he"
514	does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's
514	"afraid I might be a bother to strangers,"" began Laurie, brightening"
514	more and more.
514	""
514	"""We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be"
514	a bother.  We want to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever
514	so long.  We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got
514	"acquainted with all our neighbors but you."""
514	""
514	"""You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what"
514	happens outside.  Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know,
514	and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get
514	"on as I can."""
514	""
514	"""That's bad.  You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere"
514	you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places
514	to go to.  Never mind being bashful.  It won't last long if you keep
514	"going."""
514	""
514	Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of
514	bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible
514	not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.
514	""
514	"""Do you like your school?"" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a"
514	little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about
514	her, well pleased.
514	""
514	"""Don't go to school, I'm a businessman--girl, I mean.  I go to wait on"
514	"my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,"" answered Jo."
514	""
514	Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just
514	in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's
514	affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.
514	""
514	Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt
514	March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady,
514	her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where
514	she reveled.
514	""
514	Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old
514	gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine
514	speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy
514	lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid
514	popped her head in to see what was the matter.
514	""
514	"""Oh!  That does me no end of good.  Tell on, please,"" he said, taking"
514	his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.
514	""
514	Much elated with her success, Jo did 'tell on', all about their plays
514	and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting
514	events of the little world in which the sisters lived.  Then they got
514	to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie
514	loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.
514	""
514	"""If you like them so much, come down and see ours.  Grandfather is out,"
514	"so you needn't be afraid,"" said Laurie, getting up."
514	""
514	"""I'm not afraid of anything,"" returned Jo, with a toss of the head."
514	""
514	"""I don't believe you are!"" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much"
514	admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to
514	be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his
514	moods.
514	""
514	The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way
514	from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her
514	fancy.  And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her
514	hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted.  It was
514	lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting
514	little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow
514	chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open
514	fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.
514	""
514	"""What richness!"" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair"
514	"and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. ""Theodore"
514	"Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,"" she added"
514	impressively.
514	""
514	"""A fellow can't live on books,"" said Laurie, shaking his head as he"
514	perched on a table opposite.
514	""
514	Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with
514	"alarm, ""Mercy me!  It's your grandpa!"""
514	""
514	"""Well, what if it is?  You are not afraid of anything, you know,"""
514	returned the boy, looking wicked.
514	""
514	"""I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I should"
514	be.  Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse
514	"for it,"" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the"
514	door.
514	""
514	"""I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only"
514	afraid you are very tired of talking to me.  It was so pleasant, I
514	"couldn't bear to stop,"" said Laurie gratefully."
514	""
514	"""The doctor to see you, sir,"" and the maid beckoned as she spoke."
514	""
514	"""Would you mind if I left you for a minute?  I suppose I must see him,"""
514	said Laurie.
514	""
514	"""Don't mind me.  I'm happy as a cricket here,"" answered Jo."
514	""
514	Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was
514	standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door
514	"opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, ""I'm sure now"
514	that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his
514	mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.
514	"He isn't as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him."""
514	""
514	"""Thank you, ma'am,"" said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her"
514	great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.
514	""
514	Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began
514	to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said.  For a
514	minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly,
514	and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out
514	of the scrape as she could.  A second look showed her that the living
514	eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones,
514	and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good
514	deal.  The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said
514	"abruptly, after the dreadful pause, ""So you're not afraid of me, hey?"""
514	""
514	"""Not much, sir."""
514	""
514	"""And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?"""
514	""
514	"""Not quite, sir."""
514	""
514	"""And I've got a tremendous will, have I?"""
514	""
514	"""I only said I thought so."""
514	""
514	"""But you like me in spite of it?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, I do, sir."""
514	""
514	That answer pleased the old gentleman.  He gave a short laugh, shook
514	hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her
514	"face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, ""You've"
514	got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face.  He was a fine
514	man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and
514	"I was proud to be his friend."""
514	""
514	"""Thank you, sir,"" And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it"
514	suited her exactly.
514	""
514	"""What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?"" was the next"
514	question, sharply put.
514	""
514	"""Only trying to be neighborly, sir.""  And Jo told how her visit came"
514	about.
514	""
514	"""You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good"
514	perhaps.  We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,
514	"for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,"" said"
514	Jo eagerly.
514	""
514	"""Tut, tut, tut!  That was the boy's affair.  How is the poor woman?"""
514	""
514	"""Doing nicely, sir.""  And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told"
514	all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends
514	than they were.
514	""
514	"""Just her father's way of doing good.  I shall come and see your mother"
514	some fine day.  Tell her so.  There's the tea bell, we have it early on
514	"the boy's account.  Come down and go on being neighborly."""
514	""
514	"""If you'd like to have me, sir."""
514	""
514	"""Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't.""  And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm"
514	with old-fashioned courtesy.
514	""
514	"""What would Meg say to this?"" thought Jo, as she was marched away,"
514	while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the
514	story at home.
514	""
514	"""Hey!  Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?"" said the old"
514	gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a
514	start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his
514	redoubtable grandfather.
514	""
514	"""I didn't know you'd come, sir,"" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant"
514	little glance.
514	""
514	"""That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs.  Come to your tea,"
514	"sir, and behave like a gentleman.""  And having pulled the boy's hair by"
514	way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a
514	series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an
514	explosion of laughter from Jo.
514	""
514	The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea,
514	but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old
514	friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him.  There was
514	color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner,
514	and genuine merriment in his laugh.
514	""
514	"""She's right, the lad is lonely.  I'll see what these little girls can"
514	"do for him,"" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened.  He liked"
514	Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand
514	the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.
514	""
514	If the Laurences had been what Jo called 'prim and poky', she would not
514	have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward.
514	But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good
514	impression.  When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had
514	something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory,
514	which had been lighted for her benefit.  It seemed quite fairylike to
514	Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on
514	either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful
514	vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the
514	finest flowers till his hands were full.  Then he tied them up, saying,
514	"with the happy look Jo liked to see, ""Please give these to your mother,"
514	"and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much."""
514	""
514	They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing
514	room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which
514	stood open.
514	""
514	"""Do you play?"" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful"
514	expression.
514	""
514	"""Sometimes,"" he answered modestly."
514	""
514	"""Please do now.  I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth."""
514	""
514	"""Won't you first?"""
514	""
514	"""Don't know how.  Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly."""
514	""
514	So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in
514	heliotrope and tea roses.  Her respect and regard for the 'Laurence'
514	boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't put
514	on any airs.  She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so,
514	only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to
514	his rescue.
514	""
514	"""That will do, that will do, young lady.  Too many sugarplums are not"
514	good for him.  His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well in
514	more important things.  Going?  well, I'm much obliged to you, and I
514	hope you'll come again.  My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor
514	"Jo."""
514	""
514	He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.
514	When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something
514	amiss.  He shook his head.
514	""
514	"""No, it was me.  He doesn't like to hear me play."""
514	""
514	"""Why not?"""
514	""
514	"""I'll tell you some day.  John is going home with you, as I can't."""
514	""
514	"""No need of that.  I am not a young lady, and it's only a step.  Take"
514	"care of yourself, won't you?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, but you will come again, I hope?"""
514	""
514	"""If you promise to come and see us after you are well."""
514	""
514	"""I will."""
514	""
514	"""Good night, Laurie!"""
514	""
514	"""Good night, Jo, good night!"""
514	""
514	When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt
514	inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very
514	attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March
514	wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten
514	him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand
514	piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.
514	""
514	"""Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?"" asked Jo,"
514	who was of an inquiring disposition.
514	""
514	"""I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father,"
514	married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who
514	is very proud.  The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he
514	did not like her, and never saw his son after he married.  They both
514	died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him
514	home.  I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and
514	the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful.
514	Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother,
514	and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician.
514	At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so
514	"he 'glowered' as Jo said."""
514	""
514	"""Dear me, how romantic!"" exclaimed Meg."
514	""
514	"""How silly!"" said Jo.  ""Let him be a musician if he wants to, and not"
514	"plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go."""
514	""
514	"""That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I"
514	"suppose.  Italians are always nice,"" said Meg, who was a little"
514	sentimental.
514	""
514	"""What do you know about his eyes and his manners?  You never spoke to"
514	"him, hardly,"" cried Jo, who was not sentimental."
514	""
514	"""I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to"
514	behave.  That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent
514	"him."""
514	""
514	"""He meant the blanc mange, I suppose."""
514	""
514	"""How stupid you are, child!  He meant you, of course."""
514	""
514	"""Did he?"" And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her"
514	before.
514	""
514	"""I never saw such a girl!  You don't know a compliment when you get"
514	"it,"" said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the"
514	matter.
514	""
514	"""I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be silly"
514	and spoil my fun.  Laurie's a nice boy and I like him, and I won't have
514	any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish.  We'll all be
514	good to him because he hasn't got any mother, and he may come over and
514	"see us, mayn't he, Marmee?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will"
514	"remember that children should be children as long as they can."""
514	""
514	"""I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet,"" observed"
514	"Amy.  ""What do you say, Beth?"""
514	""
514	"""I was thinking about our '_Pilgrim's Progress_',"" answered Beth, who"
514	"had not heard a word.  ""How we got out of the Slough and through the"
514	Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying,
514	and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going
514	"to be our Palace Beautiful."""
514	""
514	"""We have got to get by the lions first,"" said Jo, as if she rather"
514	liked the prospect.
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER SIX
514	""
514	BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL
514	""
514	The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time
514	for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions.  Old
514	Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said
514	something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old
514	times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid
514	Beth.  The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich,
514	for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return.
514	But, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors,
514	and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's
514	motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in
514	that humble home of theirs.  So they soon forgot their pride and
514	interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.
514	""
514	All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new
514	friendship flourished like grass in spring.  Every one liked Laurie,
514	"and he privately informed his tutor that ""the Marches were regularly"
514	"splendid girls.""  With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took"
514	the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found
514	something very charming in the innocent companionship of these
514	simple-hearted girls.  Never having known mother or sisters, he was
514	quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy,
514	lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired
514	of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was
514	obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always
514	playing truant and running over to the Marches'.
514	""
514	"""Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,"" said"
514	"the old gentleman.  ""The good lady next door says he is studying too"
514	hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise.  I suspect she
514	is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his
514	grandmother.  Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He
514	can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs.
514	"March is doing more for him than we can."""
514	""
514	What good times they had, to be sure.  Such plays and tableaux, such
514	sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old
514	parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house.
514	Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in
514	bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed
514	the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed
514	beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie played 'lord of the manor' in
514	the most delightful style.
514	""
514	But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up
514	courage to go to the 'Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it.  She went
514	once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity,
514	"stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said ""Hey!"" so"
514	loud, that he frightened her so much her 'feet chattered on the floor',
514	she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never
514	go there any more, not even for the dear piano.  No persuasions or
514	enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr.
514	Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters.
514	During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation
514	to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine
514	organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found
514	it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and
514	nearer, as if fascinated.  At the back of his chair she stopped and
514	stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with
514	excitement of this unusual performance.  Taking no more notice of her
514	than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's
514	lessons and teachers.  And presently, as if the idea had just occurred
514	to him, he said to Mrs. March...
514	""
514	"""The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting"
514	too fond of it.  But the piano suffers for want of use.  Wouldn't some
514	of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just
514	"to keep it in tune, you know, ma'am?"""
514	""
514	Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to
514	keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and
514	the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her
514	breath away.  Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with
514	an odd little nod and smile...
514	""
514	"""They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I'm"
514	shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a
514	great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine
514	"o'clock."""
514	""
514	Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that
514	"last arrangement left nothing to be desired.  ""Please, tell the young"
514	"ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why, never mind."""
514	Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a
514	face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way...
514	""
514	"""Oh sir, they do care, very very much!"""
514	""
514	"""Are you the musical girl?"" he asked, without any startling ""Hey!"" as"
514	he looked down at her very kindly.
514	""
514	"""I'm Beth.  I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure"
514	"nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,"" she added, fearing to be rude,"
514	and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.
514	""
514	"""Not a soul, my dear.  The house is empty half the day, so come and"
514	"drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you."""
514	""
514	"""How kind you are, sir!"""
514	""
514	Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she was
514	not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she
514	had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The
514	old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping
514	down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...
514	""
514	"""I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.  God bless you, my"
514	"dear!  Good day, madam.""  And away he went, in a great hurry."
514	""
514	Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the
514	glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home.
514	How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her
514	because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in
514	her sleep.  Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out
514	of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the
514	side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing
514	room where her idol stood.  Quite by accident, of course, some pretty,
514	easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent
514	stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great
514	instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything
514	else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was
514	like the voice of a beloved friend.
514	""
514	She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no
514	appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state
514	of beatitude.
514	""
514	After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly
514	every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit
514	that came and went unseen.  She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his
514	study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked.  She never saw
514	Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never
514	suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the
514	rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her
514	about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things
514	that helped her so much.  So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found,
514	what isn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had
514	hoped.  Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing
514	that a greater was given her.  At any rate she deserved both.
514	""
514	"""Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers.  He is so"
514	kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do
514	"it?"" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his."
514	""
514	"""Yes, dear.  It will please him very much, and be a nice way of"
514	thanking him.  The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for
514	"the making up,"" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in"
514	granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked anything for
514	herself.
514	""
514	After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,
514	the materials bought, and the slippers begun.  A cluster of grave yet
514	cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very
514	appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with
514	occasional lifts over hard parts.  She was a nimble little needlewoman,
514	and they were finished before anyone got tired of them.  Then she wrote
514	a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled onto
514	the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.
514	""
514	When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen.
514	All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement
514	arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety
514	friend.  On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an
514	errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise.  As
514	she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads
514	popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,
514	several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...
514	""
514	"""Here's a letter from the old gentleman!  Come quick, and read it!"""
514	""
514	"""Oh, Beth, he's sent you..."" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly"
514	energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down
514	the window.
514	""
514	Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.  At the door her sisters
514	seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all
514	"pointing and all saying at once, ""Look there!  Look there!""  Beth did"
514	look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a
514	little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed
514	"like a sign board to ""Miss Elizabeth March."""
514	""
514	"""For me?"" gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should"
514	tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.
514	""
514	"""Yes, all for you, my precious!  Isn't it splendid of him?  Don't you"
514	think he's the dearest old man in the world?  Here's the key in the
514	"letter.  We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he says,"""
514	cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.
514	""
514	"""You read it!  I can't, I feel so queer!  Oh, it is too lovely!"" and"
514	Beth hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.
514	""
514	Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw
514	were...
514	""
514	"""Miss March: ""Dear Madam--"""
514	""
514	"""How nice it sounds!  I wish someone would write to me so!"" said Amy,"
514	who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.
514	""
514	"""'I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any"
514	"that suited me so well as yours,'"" continues Jo.  ""'Heart's-ease is my"
514	favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver.
514	I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow 'the old gentleman' to
514	send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he
514	"lost.  With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain ""'Your grateful"
514	"friend and humble servant, 'JAMES LAURENCE'."""
514	""
514	"""There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie told me"
514	how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept
514	all her little things carefully.  Just think, he's given you her piano.
514	"That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,"" said Jo, trying"
514	to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever
514	been before.
514	""
514	"""See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,"
514	puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and
514	"stool, all complete,"" added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying"
514	its beauties.
514	""
514	"""'Your humble servant, James Laurence'.  Only think of his writing that"
514	"to you.  I'll tell the girls.  They'll think it's splendid,"" said Amy,"
514	much impressed by the note.
514	""
514	"""Try it, honey.  Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny,"" said Hannah,"
514	who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.
514	""
514	So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano
514	ever heard.  It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie
514	order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the
514	happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly
514	touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright
514	pedals.
514	""
514	"""You'll have to go and thank him,"" said Jo, by way of a joke, for the"
514	idea of the child's really going never entered her head.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I mean to.  I guess I'll go now, before I get frightened thinking"
514	"about it."" And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth"
514	walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the
514	Laurences' door.
514	""
514	"""Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever see!  The"
514	"pianny has turned her head!  She'd never have gone in her right mind,"""
514	cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite
514	speechless by the miracle.
514	""
514	They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did
514	afterward.  If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the study
514	door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice
514	"called out, ""come in!"" she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who"
514	looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a
514	"small quaver in her voice, ""I came to thank you, sir, for..."" But she"
514	didn't finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech
514	and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she
514	put both arms round his neck and kissed him.
514	""
514	If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman
514	wouldn't have been more astonished.  But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he
514	liked it amazingly!  And was so touched and pleased by that confiding
514	little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on
514	his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as
514	if he had got his own little granddaughter back again.  Beth ceased to
514	fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if
514	she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude
514	can conquer pride.  When she went home, he walked with her to her own
514	gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back
514	again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old
514	gentleman, as he was.
514	""
514	When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of
514	expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her
514	"surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, ""Well, I do believe"
514	"the world is coming to an end."""
514	""
514	""

514	CHAPTER SEVEN
514	""
514	AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION
514	""
514	"""That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn't he?"" said Amy one day, as Laurie"
514	clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.
514	""
514	"""How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes?  And very handsome"
514	"ones they are, too,"" cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about"
514	her friend.
514	""
514	"""I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you need"
514	"fire up when I admire his riding."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, my goodness!  That little goose means a centaur, and she called"
514	"him a Cyclops,"" exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter."
514	""
514	"""You needn't be so rude, it's only a 'lapse of lingy', as Mr. Davis"
514	"says,"" retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin.  ""I just wish I had a"
514	"little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,"" she added, as if to"
514	herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.
514	""
514	"""Why?"" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy's"
514	second blunder.
514	""
514	"""I need it so much.  I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my turn to"
514	"have the rag money for a month."""
514	""
514	"""In debt, Amy?  What do you mean?"" And Meg looked sober."
514	""
514	"""Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay them, you"
514	know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged
514	"at the shop."""
514	""
514	"""Tell me all about it.  Are limes the fashion now?  It used to be"
514	"pricking bits of rubber to make balls.""  And Meg tried to keep her"
514	countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.
514	""
514	"""Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to"
514	be thought mean, you must do it too.  It's nothing but limes now, for
514	everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and trading them
514	off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something else, at recess.
514	If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime.  If she's mad with
514	her, she eats one before her face, and doesn't offer even a suck.  They
514	treat by turns, and I've had ever so many but haven't returned them,
514	"and I ought for they are debts of honor, you know."""
514	""
514	"""How much will pay them off and restore your credit?"" asked Meg, taking"
514	out her purse.
514	""
514	"""A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a"
514	"treat for you.  Don't you like limes?"""
514	""
514	"""Not much.  You may have my share.  Here's the money.  Make it last as"
514	"long as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, thank you!  It must be so nice to have pocket money!  I'll have a"
514	grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week.  I felt delicate
514	about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm actually suffering
514	"for one."""
514	""
514	Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the
514	temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper
514	parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.
514	During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got
514	twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to
514	treat circulated through her 'set', and the attentions of her friends
514	became quite overwhelming.  Katy Brown invited her to her next party on
514	the spot.  Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess,
514	and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon
514	her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish
514	answers to certain appalling sums.  But Amy had not forgotten Miss
514	Snow's cutting remarks about 'some persons whose noses were not too
514	flat to smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people who were not
514	too proud to ask for them', and she instantly crushed 'that Snow
514	"girl's' hopes by the withering telegram, ""You needn't be so polite all"
514	"of a sudden, for you won't get any."""
514	""
514	A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning,
514	and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her
514	foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume
514	the airs of a studious young peacock.  But, alas, alas!  Pride goes
514	before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with
514	disastrous success.  No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale
514	compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking
514	an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March
514	had pickled limes in her desk.
514	""
514	Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly
514	vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the
514	law.  This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum
514	after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated
514	novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had
514	forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done
514	all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in
514	order.  Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but
514	girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with
514	tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber.
514	Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of
514	all sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals,
514	feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular
514	importance.  It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and
514	Jenny knew it.  Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong
514	that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his
514	neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he
514	deserved.  Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, language
514	"of a schoolgirl, ""He was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear""."
514	The word 'limes' was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and
514	he rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat
514	with unusual rapidity.
514	""
514	"""Young ladies, attention, if you please!"""
514	""
514	At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,
514	gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.
514	""
514	"""Miss March, come to the desk."""
514	""
514	Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed
514	her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.
514	""
514	"""Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,"" was the unexpected"
514	command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.
514	""
514	"""Don't take all."" whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great"
514	presence of mind.
514	""
514	Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before Mr.
514	Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when
514	that delicious perfume met his nose.  Unfortunately, Mr. Davis
514	particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust
514	added to his wrath.
514	""
514	"""Is that all?"""
514	""
514	"""Not quite,"" stammered Amy."
514	""
514	"""Bring the rest immediately."""
514	""
514	With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.
514	""
514	"""You are sure there are no more?"""
514	""
514	"""I never lie, sir."""
514	""
514	"""So I see.  Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them"
514	"out of the window."""
514	""
514	There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as
514	the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.
514	Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times,
514	and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell from
514	her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of
514	the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by
514	the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes.  This--this was
514	too much.  All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable
514	Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.
514	""
514	"As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous ""Hem!"""
514	and said, in his most impressive manner...
514	""
514	"""Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago.  I am sorry"
514	this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I
514	"never break my word.  Miss March, hold out your hand."""
514	""
514	Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring
514	look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.
514	She was rather a favorite with 'old Davis', as, of course, he was
514	called, and it's my private belief that he would have broken his word
514	if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent
514	in a hiss.  That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible
514	gentleman, and sealed the culprit's fate.
514	""
514	"""Your hand, Miss March!"" was the only answer her mute appeal received,"
514	and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her head
514	defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her
514	little palm.  They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no
514	difference to her.  For the first time in her life she had been struck,
514	and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her
514	down.
514	""
514	"""You will now stand on the platform till recess,"" said Mr. Davis,"
514	resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.
514	""
514	That was dreadful.  It would have been bad enough to go to her seat,
514	and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her
514	few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon
514	her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only
514	drop down where she stood, and break her heart with crying.  A bitter
514	sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it,
514	and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove
514	funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so
514	motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that
514	pathetic figure before them.
514	""
514	During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive
514	little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.  To
514	others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a
514	hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been
514	governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her
514	before.  The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten
514	"in the sting of the thought, ""I shall have to tell at home, and they"
514	"will be so disappointed in me!"""
514	""
514	The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last,
514	and the word 'Recess!' had never seemed so welcome to her before.
514	""
514	"""You can go, Miss March,"" said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,"
514	uncomfortable.
514	""
514	He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she
514	went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched
514	"her things, and left the place ""forever,"" as she passionately declared"
514	to herself.  She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the
514	older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held
514	at once.  Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and
514	comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg
514	bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even
514	her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo
514	wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and
514	Hannah shook her fist at the 'villain' and pounded potatoes for dinner
514	as if she had him under her pestle.
514	""
514	No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates, but the
514	sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in
514	the afternoon, also unusually nervous.  Just before school closed, Jo
514	appeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk, and
514	delivered a letter from her mother, then collected Amy's property, and
514	departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat, as
514	if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.
514	""
514	"""Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a"
514	"little every day with Beth,"" said Mrs. March that evening. ""I don't"
514	approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls.  I dislike Mr.
514	Davis's manner of teaching and don't think the girls you associate with
514	are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I
514	"send you anywhere else."""
514	""
514	"""That's good!  I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old"
514	"school.  It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,"""
514	sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.
514	""
514	"""I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved"
514	"some punishment for disobedience,"" was the severe reply, which rather"
514	disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.
514	""
514	"""Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?"""
514	cried Amy.
514	""
514	"""I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,"" replied her"
514	"mother, ""but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a bolder"
514	method.  You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is
514	quite time you set about correcting it.  You have a good many little
514	gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit
514	spoils the finest genius.  There is not much danger that real talent or
514	goodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the consciousness of
514	possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of
514	"all power is modesty."""
514	""
514	"""So it is!"" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo."
514	"""I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and"
514	she didn't know it, never guessed what sweet little things she composed
514	when she was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if anyone had told
514	"her."""
514	""
514	"""I wish I'd known that nice girl.  Maybe she would have helped me, I'm"
514	"so stupid,"" said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly."
514	""
514	"""You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could,"""
514	answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his
514	merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face
514	in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.
514	""
514	Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, who
514	could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So
514	Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly
514	lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his
514	character.  When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all evening,
514	"said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, ""Is Laurie an"
514	"accomplished boy?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He will"
514	"make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,"" replied her mother."
514	""
514	"""And he isn't conceited, is he?"" asked Amy."
514	""
514	"""Not in the least.  That is why he is so charming and we all like him"
514	"so much."""
514	""
514	"""I see.  It's nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to"
514	"show off or get perked up,"" said Amy thoughtfully."
514	""
514	"""These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and"
514	conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display
514	"them,"" said Mrs. March."
514	""
514	"""Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and"
514	"ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them,"" added Jo, and"
514	the lecture ended in a laugh.
514	""

514	CHAPTER EIGHT
514	""
514	JO MEETS APOLLYON
514	""
514	"""Girls, where are you going?"" asked Amy, coming into their room one"
514	Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out with an
514	air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.
514	""
514	"""Never mind.  Little girls shouldn't ask questions,"" returned Jo"
514	sharply.
514	""
514	Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young,
514	"it is to be told that, and to be bidden to ""run away, dear"" is still"
514	more trying to us.  Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to
514	find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who
514	"never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, ""Do tell me!"
514	I should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is fussing over her
514	"piano, and I haven't got anything to do, and am so lonely."""
514	""
514	"""I can't, dear, because you aren't invited,"" began Meg, but Jo broke in"
514	"impatiently, ""Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all.  You can't"
514	"go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about it."""
514	""
514	"""You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are.  You were"
514	whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you
514	"stopped when I came in.  Aren't you going with him?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, we are.  Now do be still, and stop bothering."""
514	""
514	Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her
514	pocket.
514	""
514	"""I know!  I know!  You're going to the theater to see the _Seven"
514	"Castles!_"" she cried, adding resolutely, ""and I shall go, for Mother"
514	said I might see it, and I've got my rag money, and it was mean not to
514	"tell me in time."""
514	""
514	"""Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,"" said Meg soothingly."
514	"""Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not"
514	well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece.  Next week you
514	"can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time."""
514	""
514	"""I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please"
514	let me.  I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying
514	"for some fun.  Do, Meg!  I'll be ever so good,"" pleaded Amy, looking as"
514	pathetic as she could.
514	""
514	"""Suppose we take her.  I don't believe Mother would mind, if we bundle"
514	"her up well,"" began Meg."
514	""
514	"""If she goes I shan't, and if I don't, Laurie won't like it, and it"
514	will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy.  I
514	"should think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't wanted,"" said"
514	Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child
514	when she wanted to enjoy herself.
514	""
514	Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,
514	"in her most aggravating way, ""I shall go.  Meg says I may, and if I pay"
514	"for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it."""
514	""
514	"""You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn't sit"
514	alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our
514	pleasure.  Or he'll get another seat for you, and that isn't proper
514	when you weren't asked.  You shan't stir a step, so you may just stay
514	"where you are,"" scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her"
514	finger in her hurry.
514	""
514	Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to
514	reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls
514	hurried down, leaving their sister wailing.  For now and then she
514	forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child.  Just as the
514	party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening
514	"tone, ""You'll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain't."""
514	""
514	"""Fiddlesticks!"" returned Jo, slamming the door."
514	""
514	They had a charming time, for _The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake_
514	was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But in spite of the
514	comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and
514	princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.  The fairy
514	queen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she
514	amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her
514	'sorry for it'.  She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the
514	course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be
514	violent when fairly roused.  Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and
514	semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed
514	afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had
514	hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually
514	getting her into trouble.  Her anger never lasted long, and having
514	humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do
514	better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a
514	fury because she was such an angel afterward.  Poor Jo tried
514	desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame
514	up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.
514	""
514	When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed
514	an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from her book, or
514	asked a single question.  Perhaps curiosity might have conquered
514	resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing
514	description of the play.  On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's
514	first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had
514	soothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the
514	floor.  Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance
514	into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had
514	forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.
514	""
514	There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced
514	a tempest.  Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the
514	afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding
514	"breathlessly, ""Has anyone taken my book?"""
514	""
514	"Meg and Beth said, ""No."" at once, and looked surprised.  Amy poked the"
514	fire and said nothing.  Jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in
514	a minute.
514	""
514	"""Amy, you've got it!"""
514	""
514	"""No, I haven't."""
514	""
514	"""You know where it is, then!"""
514	""
514	"""No, I don't."""
514	""
514	"""That's a fib!"" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking"
514	fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.
514	""
514	"""It isn't.  I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and don't"
514	"care."""
514	""
514	"""You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or I'll"
514	"make you.""  And Jo gave her a slight shake."
514	""
514	"""Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book"
514	"again,"" cried Amy, getting excited in her turn."
514	""
514	"""Why not?"""
514	""
514	"""I burned it up."""
514	""
514	"""What!  My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to"
514	"finish before Father got home?  Have you really burned it?"" said Jo,"
514	turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy
514	nervously.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I did!  I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross yesterday,"
514	"and I have, so..."""
514	""
514	Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy
514	till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion of grief and
514	anger...
514	""
514	"""You wicked, wicked girl!  I never can write it again, and I'll never"
514	"forgive you as long as I live."""
514	""
514	Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside
514	herself, and with a parting box on her sister's ear, she rushed out of
514	the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.
514	""
514	The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard
514	the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her
514	sister.  Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her
514	family as a literary sprout of great promise.  It was only half a dozen
514	little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her
514	whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to
514	print.  She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the
514	old manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work of
514	several years.  It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a
514	dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.
514	Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her
514	pet.  Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one
514	would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now
514	regretted more than any of them.
514	""
514	When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable
514	that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly...
514	""
514	"""Please forgive me, Jo.  I'm very, very sorry."""
514	""
514	"""I never shall forgive you,"" was Jo's stern answer, and from that"
514	moment she ignored Amy entirely.
514	""
514	No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all had
514	learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted,
514	and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own
514	generous nature, softened Jo's resentment and healed the breach.  It
514	was not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their
514	mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was
514	wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed.  They felt this most
514	when singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a
514	stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother sang alone.  But in spite
514	of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not
514	seem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.
514	""
514	"As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, ""My"
514	dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger.  Forgive each other,
514	"help each other, and begin again tomorrow."""
514	""
514	Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her
514	grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she
514	felt so deeply injured that she really couldn't quite forgive yet.  So
514	she winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because Amy was
514	"listening, ""It was an abominable thing, and she doesn't deserve to be"
514	"forgiven."""
514	""
514	With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or
514	confidential gossip that night.
514	""
514	Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed,
514	and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured
514	than ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which
514	was particularly exasperating.  Jo still looked like a thunder cloud,
514	and nothing went well all day.  It was bitter cold in the morning, she
514	dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack
514	of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful
514	when she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were
514	always talking about being good and yet wouldn't even try when other
514	people set them a virtuous example.
514	""
514	"""Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating.  He is always"
514	"kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,"" said Jo to herself,"
514	and off she went.
514	""
514	Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient
514	exclamation.
514	""
514	"""There!  She promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice"
514	"we shall have.  But it's no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me."""
514	""
514	"""Don't say that.  You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive the"
514	loss of her precious little book, but I think she might do it now, and
514	"I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,"" said Meg.  ""Go"
514	after them.  Don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with
514	Laurie, than take a quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind
514	"thing, and I'm sure she'll be friends again with all her heart."""
514	""
514	"""I'll try,"" said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to"
514	get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over
514	the hill.
514	""
514	It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached
514	them.  Jo saw her coming, and turned her back.  Laurie did not see, for
514	he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm
514	spell had preceded the cold snap.
514	""
514	"""I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before we"
514	"begin to race,"" Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a"
514	young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.
514	""
514	Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on
514	her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned and
514	went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of
514	satisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished her anger till
514	it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and
514	feelings always do unless cast out at once.  As Laurie turned the bend,
514	he shouted back...
514	""
514	"""Keep near the shore.  It isn't safe in the middle."" Jo heard, but Amy"
514	was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word.  Jo glanced over
514	her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear...
514	""
514	"""No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself."""
514	""
514	Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,
514	far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the
514	river.  For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her
514	heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her
514	round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a
514	sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made
514	Jo's heart stand still with fear.  She tried to call Laurie, but her
514	voice was gone.  She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have
514	no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless,
514	staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the
514	black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried
514	out...
514	""
514	"""Bring a rail.  Quick, quick!"""
514	""
514	How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she worked
514	as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,
514	and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged
514	a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more
514	frightened than hurt.
514	""
514	"""Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can.  Pile our things on"
514	"her, while I get off these confounded skates,"" cried Laurie, wrapping"
514	his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed
514	so intricate before.
514	""
514	Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an
514	exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot
514	fire.  During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about,
514	looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and
514	her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When
514	Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by
514	the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.
514	""
514	"""Are you sure she is safe?"" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the"
514	golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever
514	under the treacherous ice.
514	""
514	"""Quite safe, dear.  She is not hurt, and won't even take cold, I think,"
514	"you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,"" replied"
514	her mother cheerfully.
514	""
514	"""Laurie did it all.  I only let her go.  Mother, if she should die, it"
514	"would be my fault.""  And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of"
514	penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her
514	hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the
514	heavy punishment which might have come upon her.
514	""
514	"""It's my dreadful temper!  I try to cure it, I think I have, and then"
514	it breaks out worse than ever.  Oh, Mother, what shall I do?  What
514	"shall I do?"" cried poor Jo, in despair."
514	""
514	"""Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is"
514	"impossible to conquer your fault,"" said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy"
514	head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo
514	cried even harder.
514	""
514	"""You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is!  It seems as if I could"
514	do anything when I'm in a passion.  I get so savage, I could hurt
514	anyone and enjoy it.  I'm afraid I shall do something dreadful some
514	day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help
514	"me, do help me!"""
514	""
514	"""I will, my child, I will.  Don't cry so bitterly, but remember this"
514	day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another
514	like it.  Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than
514	yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them.  You think
514	your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like
514	"it."""
514	""
514	"""Yours, Mother?  Why, you are never angry!""  And for the moment Jo"
514	forgot remorse in surprise.
514	""
514	"""I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded"
514	in controlling it.  I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I
514	have learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn not to feel it,
514	"though it may take me another forty years to do so."""
514	""
514	The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a
514	better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof.  She
514	felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her.  The
514	knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,
514	made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it,
514	though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a
514	girl of fifteen.
514	""
514	"""Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go"
514	"out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you?"""
514	asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and"
514	when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away
514	for a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and
514	"wicked,"" answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed"
514	and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair.
514	""
514	"""How did you learn to keep still?  That is what troubles me, for the"
514	sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about, and the more I say
514	the worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's feelings and say
514	"dreadful things.  Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear."""
514	""
514	"""My good mother used to help me..."""
514	""
514	"""As you do us..."" interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss."
514	""
514	"""But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years"
514	had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to
514	anyone else.  I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears
514	over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on.
514	Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be
514	good.  But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we
514	were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by
514	"nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything."""
514	""
514	"""Poor Mother!  What helped you then?"""
514	""
514	"""Your father, Jo.  He never loses patience, never doubts or complains,"
514	but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed
514	to do otherwise before him.  He helped and comforted me, and showed me
514	that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little
514	girls possess, for I was their example.  It was easier to try for your
514	sakes than for my own. A startled or surprised look from one of you
514	when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done,
514	and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest
514	reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them
514	"copy."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, Mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,"""
514	cried Jo, much touched.
514	""
514	"""I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch"
514	over your 'bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not
514	spoil your life.  You have had a warning. Remember it, and try with
514	heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you
514	"greater sorrow and regret than you have known today."""
514	""
514	"""I will try, Mother, I truly will.  But you must help me, remind me,"
514	and keep me from flying out.  I used to see Father sometimes put his
514	finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face,
514	and you always folded your lips tight and went away.  Was he reminding
514	"you then?"" asked Jo softly."
514	""
514	"""Yes.  I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me"
514	"from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look."""
514	""
514	Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled as she
514	spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,
514	"""Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it?  I didn't mean to be"
514	rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so
514	"safe and happy here."""
514	""
514	"""My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest"
514	happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how
514	"much I love them."""
514	""
514	"""I thought I'd grieved you."""
514	""
514	"""No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how"
514	much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his
514	"little daughters safe and good for him."""
514	""
514	"""Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went, and never"
514	"complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,"" said Jo, wondering."
514	""
514	"""I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was"
514	gone.  Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty
514	and will surely be the happier for it in the end?  If I don't seem to
514	need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to
514	comfort and sustain me.  My child, the troubles and temptations of your
514	life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive
514	them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your
514	Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one.  The more you love
514	and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will
514	depend on human power and wisdom.  His love and care never tire or
514	change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of
514	lifelong peace, happiness, and strength.  Believe this heartily, and go
514	to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as
514	"freely and confidingly as you come to your mother."""
514	""
514	Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which
514	followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart
514	without words.  For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not
514	only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of
514	self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother's hand, she had
514	drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love
514	stronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.
514	""
514	Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at once
514	to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it
514	had never worn before.
514	""
514	"""I let the sun go down on my anger.  I wouldn't forgive her, and today,"
514	if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too late!  How could I
514	"be so wicked?"" said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister"
514	softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.
514	""
514	As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a
514	smile that went straight to Jo's heart.  Neither said a word, but they
514	hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was
514	forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.

514	MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR
514	""
514	"""I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those"
514	"children should have the measles just now,"" said Meg, one April day, as"
514	she stood packing the 'go abroady' trunk in her room, surrounded by her
514	sisters.
514	""
514	"""And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise.  A whole"
514	"fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,"" replied Jo, looking like"
514	a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.
514	""
514	"""And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that,"" added Beth, tidily"
514	sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great
514	occasion.
514	""
514	"""I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice"
514	"things,"" said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically"
514	replenished her sister's cushion.
514	""
514	"""I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep my"
514	adventures to tell you when I come back.  I'm sure it's the least I can
514	do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get
514	"ready,"" said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,"
514	which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.
514	""
514	"""What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?"" asked Amy, who had"
514	not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs.
514	March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when
514	the proper time came.
514	""
514	"""A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue"
514	sash.  I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't time to make it over,
514	"so I must be contented with my old tarlaton."""
514	""
514	""
514	"""It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it"
514	off beautifully.  I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you
514	"might have had it,"" said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose"
514	possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.
514	""
514	"""There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but"
514	Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,
514	"and Laurie promised to send me all I want,"" replied Meg.  ""Now, let me"
514	see, there's my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my
514	hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks
514	heavy for spring, doesn't it?  The violet silk would be so nice.  Oh,
514	"dear!"""
514	""
514	"""Never mind, you've got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always"
514	"look like an angel in white,"" said Amy, brooding over the little store"
514	of finery in which her soul delighted.
514	""
514	"""It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to"
514	do.  My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that
514	I feel as if I'd got a new one.  My silk sacque isn't a bit the
514	fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's.  I didn't like to
514	say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella.  I told
514	Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one
514	with a yellowish handle.  It's strong and neat, so I ought not to
514	complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one
514	"with a gold top,"" sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great"
514	disfavor.
514	""
514	"""Change it,"" advised Jo."
514	""
514	"""I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took so much"
514	pains to get my things.  It's a nonsensical notion of mine, and I'm not
514	going to give up to it.  My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves
514	are my comfort.  You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo.  I feel so rich
514	and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up
514	"for common.""  And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box."
514	""
514	"""Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put"
514	"some on mine?"" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,"
514	fresh from Hannah's hands.
514	""
514	"""No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns without"
514	"any trimming on them.  Poor folks shouldn't rig,"" said Jo decidedly."
514	""
514	"""I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my"
514	"clothes and bows on my caps?"" said Meg impatiently."
514	""
514	"""You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you could only"
514	"go to Annie Moffat's,"" observed Beth in her quiet way."
514	""
514	"""So I did!  Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does seem as if"
514	the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it?  There now, the trays
514	are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for
514	"Mother to pack,"" said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the"
514	half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton,
514	which she called her 'ball dress' with an important air.
514	""
514	The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of
514	novelty and pleasure.  Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather
514	reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented
514	than she went.  But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take
514	good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a
514	winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went
514	to take her first taste of fashionable life.
514	""
514	The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,
514	at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its
514	occupants.  But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life
514	they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,
514	without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated
514	or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite
514	conceal the ordinary material of which they were made.  It certainly
514	was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her
514	best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself.  It suited her
514	exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of
514	those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,
514	crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as
514	well as she could.  The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things,
514	the more she envied her and sighed to be rich.  Home now looked bare
514	and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she
514	felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of
514	the new gloves and silk stockings.
514	""
514	She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls
514	were busily employed in 'having a good time'.  They shopped, walked,
514	rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at
514	home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to
514	entertain them.  Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one
514	was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.
514	Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and
514	Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as
514	her daughter had done.  Everyone petted her, and 'Daisey', as they
514	called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.
514	""
514	When the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin
514	wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses
514	and making themselves very fine indeed.  So out came the tarlatan,
514	looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new
514	one.  Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her
514	cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud.
514	No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and
514	Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white
514	arms.  But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her
514	heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others
514	laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.  The hard,
514	bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box
514	of flowers.  Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all
514	were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.
514	""
514	"""It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are"
514	"altogether ravishing,"" cried Annie, with a great sniff."
514	""
514	"""They are for Miss March, the man said.  And here's a note,"" put in the"
514	maid, holding it to Meg.
514	""
514	"""What fun!  Who are they from?  Didn't know you had a lover,"" cried the"
514	girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.
514	""
514	"""The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,"" said Meg"
514	simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.
514	""
514	"""Oh, indeed!"" said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note"
514	into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false
514	pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers
514	cheered her up by their beauty.
514	""
514	Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for
514	herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the
514	breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that
514	Clara, the elder sister, told her she was 'the sweetest little thing
514	she ever saw', and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.
514	Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest
514	went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed
514	face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and
514	fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so very
514	shabby now.
514	""
514	She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her
514	heart's content.  Everyone was very kind, and she had three
514	compliments.  Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a
514	remarkably fine voice.  Major Lincoln asked who 'the fresh little girl
514	with the beautiful eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with
514	her because she 'didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her', as he
514	gracefully expressed it.  So altogether she had a very nice time, till
514	she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely.
514	She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner
514	to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of
514	the flowery wall...
514	""
514	"""How old is he?"""
514	""
514	"""Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,"" replied another voice."
514	""
514	"""It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it?  Sallie"
514	"says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them."""
514	""
514	"""Mrs. M.  has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,"
514	"early as it is.  The girl evidently doesn't think of it yet,"" said Mrs."
514	Moffat.
514	""
514	"""She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and colored up"
514	when the flowers came quite prettily.  Poor thing! She'd be so nice if
514	she was only got up in style.  Do you think she'd be offended if we
514	"offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?"" asked another voice."
514	""
514	"""She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy tarlaton"
514	is all she has got.  She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good
514	"excuse for offering a decent one."""
514	""
514	Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and
514	rather agitated.  She was proud, and her pride was useful just then,
514	for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what
514	she had just heard.  For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she
514	could not help understanding the gossip of her friends.  She tried to
514	"forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, ""Mrs. M.  has"
514	"made her plans,"" ""that fib about her mamma,"" and ""dowdy tarlaton,"" till"
514	she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for
514	advice.  As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and
514	being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an
514	effort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she
514	was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till
514	her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.
514	Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and
514	much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived
514	as happily as a child.  Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled
514	by the silly speeches she had overheard.  Her faith in her mother was a
514	little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat,
514	who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be
514	contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter
514	was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby
514	dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.
514	""
514	Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half
514	resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not
514	speaking out frankly and setting everything right.  Everybody dawdled
514	that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even
514	to take up their worsted work.  Something in the manner of her friends
514	struck Meg at once.  They treated her with more respect, she thought,
514	took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with
514	eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity.  All this surprised and flattered
514	her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from
514	her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...
514	""
514	"""Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for"
514	Thursday.  We should like to know him, and it's only a proper
514	"compliment to you."""
514	""
514	Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply
514	"demurely, ""You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't come."""
514	""
514	"""Why not, Cherie?"" asked Miss Belle."
514	""
514	"""He's too old."""
514	""
514	"""My child, what do you mean?  What is his age, I beg to know!"" cried"
514	Miss Clara.
514	""
514	"""Nearly seventy, I believe,"" answered Meg, counting stitches to hide"
514	the merriment in her eyes.
514	""
514	"""You sly creature!  Of course we meant the young man,"" exclaimed Miss"
514	Belle, laughing.
514	""
514	"""There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy.""  And Meg laughed also"
514	at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her
514	supposed lover.
514	""
514	"""About your age,"" Nan said."
514	""
514	"""Nearer my sister Jo's; I am seventeen in August,"" returned Meg,"
514	tossing her head.
514	""
514	"""It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?"" said Annie,"
514	looking wise about nothing.
514	""
514	"""Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are"
514	so fond of them.  My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,
514	"so it is quite natural that we children should play together,"" and Meg"
514	hoped they would say no more.
514	""
514	"""It's evident Daisy isn't out yet,"" said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod."
514	""
514	"""Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,"" returned Miss Belle"
514	with a shrug.
514	""
514	"""I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls.  Can I do"
514	"anything for you, young ladies?"" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like"
514	an elephant in silk and lace.
514	""
514	"""No, thank you, ma'am,"" replied Sallie.  ""I've got my new pink silk for"
514	"Thursday and don't want a thing."""
514	""
514	"""Nor I..."" began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her that she"
514	did want several things and could not have them.
514	""
514	"""What shall you wear?"" asked Sallie."
514	""
514	"""My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadly"
514	"torn last night,"" said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling"
514	very uncomfortable.
514	""
514	"""Why don't you send home for another?"" said Sallie, who was not an"
514	observing young lady.
514	""
514	"""I haven't got any other.""  It cost Meg an effort to say that, but"
514	"Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, ""Only that?"
514	"How funny...""  She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook her head"
514	at her and broke in, saying kindly...
514	""
514	"""Not at all.  Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she"
514	isn't out yet?  There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had
514	a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown,
514	"and you shall wear it to please me, won't you, dear?"""
514	""
514	"""You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress if you don't, it does"
514	"well enough for a little girl like me,"" said Meg."
514	""
514	"""Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to"
514	do it, and you'd be a regular little beauty with a touch here and
514	there.  I shan't let anyone see you till you are done, and then we'll
514	"burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,"""
514	said Belle in her persuasive tone.
514	""
514	Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if
514	she would be 'a little beauty' after touching up caused her to accept
514	and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.
514	""
514	On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and
514	between them they turned Meg into a fine lady.  They crimped and curled
514	her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,
514	touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense
514	would have added 'a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not rebelled.  They
514	laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly
514	breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in
514	the mirror.  A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,
514	brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink
514	silk which did not show.  A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and
514	a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders,
514	and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her
514	heart.  A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder
514	holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the
514	satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.
514	""
514	"""Mademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she not?"" cried Hortense,"
514	clasping her hands in an affected rapture.
514	""
514	"""Come and show yourself,"" said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room"
514	where the others were waiting.
514	""
514	As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings
514	tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her
514	fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that
514	she was 'a little beauty'.  Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase
514	enthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in
514	the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like
514	a party of magpies.
514	""
514	"""While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt"
514	and those French heels, or she will trip herself up.  Take your silver
514	butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,
514	"Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,"""
514	said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.
514	""
514	"""You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere"
514	beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I
514	assure you.  Let your flowers hang, don't be so careful of them, and be
514	"sure you don't trip,"" returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was"
514	prettier than herself.
514	""
514	Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs
514	and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early
514	guests were assembled.  She very soon discovered that there is a charm
514	about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures
514	their respect.  Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her
514	before, were very affectionate all of a sudden.  Several young
514	gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only
514	stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but
514	agreeable things to her, and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas,
514	and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air
514	of interest.  She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...
514	""
514	"""Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,"
514	but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;
514	"sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her."""
514	""
514	"""Dear me!"" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another"
514	observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard and been
514	rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs. The 'queer feeling' did not pass
514	away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so
514	got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the
514	train kept getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest
514	her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken.  She was flirting
514	her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried
514	to be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused,
514	for just opposite, she saw Laurie.  He was staring at her with
514	undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for though he
514	bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and
514	wish she had her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle
514	nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to
514	see, looked unusually boyish and shy.
514	""
514	"""Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head.  I won't care for"
514	"it, or let it change me a bit,"" thought Meg, and rustled across the"
514	room to shake hands with her friend.
514	""
514	"""I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't."" she said, with her most"
514	grown-up air.
514	""
514	"""Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,"" answered"
514	Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her
514	maternal tone.
514	""
514	"""What shall you tell her?"" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his"
514	opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.
514	""
514	"""I shall say I didn't know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike"
514	"yourself, I'm quite afraid of you,"" he said, fumbling at his glove"
514	button.
514	""
514	"""How absurd of you!  The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like"
514	"it.  Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?"" said Meg, bent on making him say"
514	whether he thought her improved or not.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I think she would,"" returned Laurie gravely."
514	""
514	"""Don't you like me so?"" asked Meg."
514	""
514	"""No, I don't,"" was the blunt reply."
514	""
514	"""Why not?"" in an anxious tone."
514	""
514	He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically
514	trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,
514	which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it.
514	""
514	"""I don't like fuss and feathers."""
514	""
514	That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg
514	"walked away, saying petulantly, ""You are the rudest boy I ever saw."""
514	""
514	Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool
514	her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant
514	color.  As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after
514	she heard him saying to his mother...
514	""
514	"""They are making a fool of that little girl.  I wanted you to see her,"
514	"but they have spoiled her entirely.  She's nothing but a doll tonight."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear!"" sighed Meg.  ""I wish I'd been sensible and worn my own"
514	things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so
514	"uncomfortable and ashamed of myself."""
514	""
514	She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the
514	curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some
514	one touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he
514	said, with his very best bow and his hand out...
514	""
514	"""Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me."""
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,"" said Meg, trying to"
514	look offended and failing entirely.
514	""
514	"""Not a bit of it, I'm dying to do it.  Come, I'll be good. I don't like"
514	"your gown, but I do think you are just splendid."" And he waved his"
514	hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.
514	""
514	Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch
514	"the time, ""Take care my skirt doesn't trip you up.  It's the plague of"
514	"my life and I was a goose to wear it."""
514	""
514	"""Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,"" said Laurie,"
514	looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.
514	""
514	Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home,
514	they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant
514	sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more
514	friendly than ever after their small tiff.
514	""
514	"""Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?"" said Meg, as he stood"
514	fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon though she
514	would not own why.
514	""
514	"""Won't I!"" said Laurie, with alacrity."
514	""
514	"""Please don't tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won't"
514	"understand the joke, and it will worry Mother."""
514	""
514	"""Then why did you do it?"" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that Meg"
514	hastily added...
514	""
514	"""I shall tell them myself all about it, and 'fess' to Mother how silly"
514	"I've been.  But I'd rather do it myself.  So you'll not tell, will you?"""
514	""
514	"""I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when they ask me?"""
514	""
514	"""Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time."""
514	""
514	"""I'll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other?  You"
514	"don't look as if you were having a good time.  Are you?"" And Laurie"
514	looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper...
514	""
514	"""No, not just now.  Don't think I'm horrid.  I only wanted a little"
514	"fun, but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it."""
514	""
514	"""Here comes Ned Moffat.  What does he want?"" said Laurie, knitting his"
514	black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a
514	pleasant addition to the party.
514	""
514	"""He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's coming for"
514	"them.  What a bore!"" said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused"
514	Laurie immensely.
514	""
514	He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her drinking
514	champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving 'like a
514	pair of fools', as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort
514	of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a
514	defender was needed.
514	""
514	"""You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that."
514	"I wouldn't, Meg, your mother doesn't like it, you know,"" he whispered,"
514	leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher
514	stooped to pick up her fan.
514	""
514	"""I'm not Meg tonight, I'm 'a doll' who does all sorts of crazy things."
514	Tomorrow I shall put away my 'fuss and feathers' and be desperately
514	"good again,"" she answered with an affected little laugh."
514	""
514	"""Wish tomorrow was here, then,"" muttered Laurie, walking off,"
514	ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.
514	""
514	Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did.
514	After supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly
514	upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that
514	scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture.  But he got
514	no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say
514	good night.
514	""
514	"""Remember!"" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had"
514	already begun.
514	""
514	"""Silence a la mort,"" replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as"
514	he went away.
514	""
514	This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg was too
514	tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a
514	masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected.  She was
514	sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with
514	her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had 'sat in the lap of luxury'
514	long enough.
514	""
514	"""It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all"
514	"the time.  Home is a nice place, though it isn't splendid,"" said Meg,"
514	looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother
514	and Jo on the Sunday evening.
514	""
514	"""I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem"
514	"dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,"" replied her mother, who"
514	had given her many anxious looks that day.  For motherly eyes are quick
514	to see any change in children's faces.
514	""
514	Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a
514	charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her
514	spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat
514	thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried.
514	As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her
514	chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee,
514	saying bravely...
514	""
514	"""Marmee, I want to 'fess'."""
514	""
514	"""I thought so.  What is it, dear?"""
514	""
514	"""Shall I go away?"" asked Jo discreetly."
514	""
514	"""Of course not.  Don't I always tell you everything?  I was ashamed to"
514	speak of it before the younger children, but I want you to know all the
514	"dreadful things I did at the Moffats'."""
514	""
514	"""We are prepared,"" said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little"
514	anxious.
514	""
514	"""I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they"
514	powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a
514	fashion-plate.  Laurie thought I wasn't proper.  I know he did, though
514	he didn't say so, and one man called me 'a doll'.  I knew it was silly,
514	but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of
514	"nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me."""
514	""
514	"""Is that all?"" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast"
514	face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to
514	blame her little follies.
514	""
514	"""No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was"
514	"altogether abominable,"" said Meg self-reproachfully."
514	""
514	"""There is something more, I think.""  And Mrs. March smoothed the soft"
514	cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...
514	""
514	"""Yes.  It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have"
514	"people say and think such things about us and Laurie."""
514	""
514	Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats',
514	and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill
514	pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind.
514	""
514	"""Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard,"" cried Jo"
514	"indignantly.  ""Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the spot?"""
514	""
514	"""I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me.  I couldn't help hearing at"
514	first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't remember that I
514	"ought to go away."""
514	""
514	"""Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to settle"
514	such ridiculous stuff.  The idea of having 'plans' and being kind to
514	Laurie because he's rich and may marry us by-and-by!  Won't he shout
514	"when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?"""
514	And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good
514	joke.
514	""
514	"""If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you!  She mustn't, must she,"
514	"Mother?"" said Meg, looking distressed."
514	""
514	"""No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you"
514	"can,"" said Mrs. March gravely.  ""I was very unwise to let you go among"
514	people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but worldly,
514	ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people.  I am more
514	sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,
514	"Meg."""
514	""
514	"""Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me.  I'll forget all the bad and"
514	remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you
514	very much for letting me go.  I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied,
514	Mother.  I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay with you till
514	I'm fit to take care of myself.  But it is nice to be praised and
514	"admired, and I can't help saying I like it,"" said Meg, looking half"
514	ashamed of the confession.
514	""
514	"""That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not"
514	become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things.
514	Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite
514	the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty,
514	"Meg."""
514	""
514	Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind
514	her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new
514	thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and
514	things of that sort.  And Jo felt as if during that fortnight her
514	sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a
514	world where she could not follow.
514	""
514	"""Mother, do you have 'plans', as Mrs. Moffat said?"" asked Meg bashfully."
514	""
514	"""Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine differ"
514	somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect.  I will tell you some of them,
514	for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and
514	heart of yours right, on a very serious subject.  You are young, Meg,
514	but not too young to understand me, and mothers' lips are the fittest
514	to speak of such things to girls like you.  Jo, your turn will come in
514	time, perhaps, so listen to my 'plans' and help me carry them out, if
514	"they are good."""
514	""
514	Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they
514	were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,
514	and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her
514	serious yet cheery way...
514	""
514	"""I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. To be"
514	admired, loved, and respected.  To have a happy youth, to be well and
514	wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care
514	and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen
514	by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a
514	woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful
514	experience.  It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait
514	for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when the happy time comes,
514	you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy.  My dear
514	girls, I am ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the
514	world, marry rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid
514	houses, which are not homes because love is wanting.  Money is a
514	needful and precious thing, and when well used, a noble thing, but I
514	never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for.
514	I'd rather see you poor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved,
514	"contented, than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace."""
514	""
514	"""Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put"
514	"themselves forward,"" sighed Meg."
514	""
514	"""Then we'll be old maids,"" said Jo stoutly."
514	""
514	"""Right, Jo.  Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or"
514	"unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands,"" said Mrs. March"
514	"decidedly.  ""Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere"
514	lover.  Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls,
514	but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave
514	these things to time.  Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for
514	homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they
514	are not.  One thing remember, my girls.  Mother is always ready to be
514	your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust
514	that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and
514	"comfort of our lives."""
514	""
514	"""We will, Marmee, we will!"" cried both, with all their hearts, as she"
514	bade them good night.
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER TEN
514	""
514	THE P.C. AND P.O.
514	""
514	As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the
514	lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.
514	The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the
514	"little plot to do what she liked with.  Hannah used to say, ""I'd know"
514	"which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny,"" and so"
514	she might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.
514	Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.
514	Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying
514	experiments.  This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the
514	seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed Aunt
514	Cockle-top and her family of chicks.  Beth had old-fashioned fragrant
514	flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,
514	pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and catnip for
514	the pussies.  Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but
514	very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging
514	their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall
514	white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants
514	as would consent to blossom there.
514	""
514	Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine
514	days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some old, some
514	new, all more or less original.  One of these was the 'P.C.', for as
514	secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one,
514	and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the
514	Pickwick Club.  With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a
514	year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which
514	occasions the ceremonies were as follows:  Three chairs were arranged
514	in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges,
514	with a big 'P.C.' in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper
514	called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something,
514	while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven
514	o'clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges
514	round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity.  Meg, as
514	the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus
514	Snodgrass, Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,
514	who was always trying to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.
514	Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original
514	tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which
514	they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short
514	comings.  On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles
514	without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared
514	hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he
514	arranged himself properly, began to read:

514	    Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble
514	    steps, and left its lovely load to swell the
514	    brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count
514	    Adelon.  Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks
514	    and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance.
514	    Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so
514	    with mirth and music the masquerade went on.
514	"    ""Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight?"""
514	    asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who
514	    floated down the hall upon his arm.
514	""
514	"    ""Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad!  Her"
514	    dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds
514	"    Count Antonio, whom she passionately hates."""
514	""
514	"    ""By my faith, I envy him.  Yonder he comes,"
514	    arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask.
514	    When that is off we shall see how he regards the
514	    fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her
514	"    stern father bestows her hand,"" returned the troubadour."
514	""
514	"    ""Tis whispered that she loves the young English"
514	    artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the
514	"    old Count,"" said the lady, as they joined the dance."
514	    The revel was at its height when a priest
514	    appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove,
514	    hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel.
514	    Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a
514	    sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of
514	    orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the
514	    hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:
514	""
514	"    ""My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which"
514	    I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of
514	"    my daughter.  Father, we wait your services."""
514	    All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a
514	    murmur of amazement went through the throng, for
514	    neither bride nor groom removed their masks.  Curiosity
514	    and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained
514	    all tongues till the holy rite was over.  Then the
514	    eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding
514	    an explanation.
514	""
514	"    ""Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only"
514	    know that it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I
514	    yielded to it.  Now, my children, let the play end.
514	"    Unmask and receive my blessing."""
514	""
514	    But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom
514	    replied in a tone that startled all listeners
514	    as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand
514	    Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the
514	    breast where now flashed the star of an English earl
514	    was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.
514	""
514	"    ""My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your"
514	    daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a
514	    fortune as the Count Antonio.  I can do more, for even
514	    your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux
514	    and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless
514	    wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,
514	"    now my wife."""
514	""
514	    The count stood like one changed to stone, and
514	    turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with
514	"    a gay smile of triumph, ""To you, my gallant friends, I"
514	    can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has
514	    done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have

514	    to market.  A grocerman bought and put it in his shop.
514	    That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat
514	    and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went
514	    and bought it for her mother.  She lugged it home, cut
514	    it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it
514	    with salt and butter, for dinner.  And to the rest she added
514	    a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg,

514	    A SAD ACCIDENT
514	""
514	    On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock
514	    in our basement, followed by cries of distress.
514	    On rushing in a body to the cellar, we discovered our beloved
514	    President prostrate upon the floor, having tripped and
514	    fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes.  A perfect
514	    scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr. Pickwick
514	    had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water,
514	    upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form,  and torn
514	    his garments badly.  On being removed from this perilous
514	    situation, it was discovered that he had suffered

514	    Snowball Pat Paw.  This lovely and beloved cat was the
514	    pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends; for

514	    endeared her to all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt
514	    by the whole community.

514	    When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching
514	    the butcher's cart, and it is feared that some villain,
514	    tempted by her charms, basely stole her.  Weeks have passed,
514	    but no trace of her has been discovered, and we relinquish

514	"Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest.  ""Sir, I give you my word as a"

514	"""The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,"" began Mr. Pickwick,"
514	trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an

514	"the hand, ""who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed"
514	for the base stratagem of tonight.  I planned it, and she only gave in
514	"after lots of teasing."""

514	""
514	"""Never mind what she says.  I'm the wretch that did it, sir,"" said the"
514	"new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick.  ""But on my honor,"
514	I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself to the interest
514	"of this immortal club."""
514	""
514	"""Hear!  Hear!"" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a"
514	cymbal.
514	""
514	"""Go on, go on!"" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed"
514	benignly.
514	""
514	"""I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the"
514	honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between
514	adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the
514	lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on
514	the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I
514	may be allowed the expression.  It's the old martin house, but I've
514	stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts
514	of things, and save our valuable time.  Letters, manuscripts, books,
514	and bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it
514	will be uncommonly nice, I fancy.  Allow me to present the club key,
514	"and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat."""
514	""
514	Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and
514	subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some
514	time before order could be restored.  A long discussion followed, and
514	everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her best.  So it was an
514	unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it
514	broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.
514	""
514	No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,
514	well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did
514	add 'spirit' to the meetings, and 'a tone' to the paper, for his
514	orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent,
514	being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never
514	sentimental.  Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or
514	Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought.
514	""
514	The P.  O.  was a capital little institution, and flourished
514	wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as
514	through the real post office.  Tragedies and cravats, poetry and
514	pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers,
514	invitations, scoldings, and puppies.  The old gentleman liked the fun,
514	and amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and
514	funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah's
514	charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's care.  How they laughed
514	when the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that
514	little post office would hold in the years to come.

514	"""Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!"" said Jo. ""I was"
514	mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her.  If she had, I should have
514	felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a
514	churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry
514	getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to
514	me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly
514	helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me.
514	I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright,
514	for as it drove of, she popped out her head, saying, 'Josyphine, won't
514	you--?' I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled.  I did
514	"actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe."""
514	""
514	"""Poor old Jo!  She came in looking as if bears were after her,"" said"
514	Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.
514	""
514	"""Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?"" observed Amy, tasting"
514	her mixture critically.
514	""
514	"""She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter.  It's too warm"
514	"to be particular about one's parts of speech,"" murmured Jo."
514	""
514	"""What shall you do all your vacation?"" asked Amy, changing the subject"
514	with tact.
514	""
514	"""I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,"" replied Meg, from the depths"
514	"of the rocking chair.  ""I've been routed up early all winter and had to"
514	spend my days working for other people, so now I'm going to rest and
514	"revel to my heart's content."""
514	""
514	"""No,"" said Jo, ""that dozy way wouldn't suit me.  I've laid in a heap of"
514	books, and I'm going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in
514	"the old apple tree, when I'm not having l----"""
514	""
514	"""Don't say 'larks!'"" implored Amy, as a return snub for the 'samphire'"
514	correction.
514	""
514	"""I'll say 'nightingales' then, with Laurie.  That's proper and"
514	"appropriate, since he's a warbler."""
514	""
514	"""Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time"
514	"and rest, as the girls mean to,"" proposed Amy."
514	""
514	"""Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind.  I want to learn some new songs,"
514	and my children need fitting up for the summer.  They are dreadfully
514	"out of order and really suffering for clothes."""
514	""
514	"""May we, Mother?"" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in"
514	what they called 'Marmee's corner'.
514	""
514	"""You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it.  I"
514	think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as
514	"bad as all work and no play."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear, no!  It will be delicious, I'm sure,"" said Meg complacently."
514	""
514	"""I now propose a toast, as my 'friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp', says."
514	"Fun forever, and no grubbing!"" cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the"
514	lemonade went round.
514	""
514	They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the
514	rest of the day.  Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock.
514	Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely
514	and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and
514	Amy's books lay scattered about.  Nothing was neat and pleasant but
514	'Marmee's corner', which looked as usual.  And there Meg sat, to 'rest
514	and read', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses
514	she would get with her salary.  Jo spent the morning on the river with
514	Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over _The Wide, Wide
514	World_, up in the apple tree.  Beth began by rummaging everything out
514	of the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before
514	half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her
514	music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her
514	bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to
514	draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who
514	the young artist was.  As no one appeared but an inquisitive
514	daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk,
514	got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.
514	""
514	At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a
514	delightful, though unusually long day.  Meg, who went shopping in the
514	afternoon and got a 'sweet blue muslin', had discovered, after she had
514	cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her
514	slightly cross.  Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a
514	raging headache by reading too long.  Beth was worried by the confusion
514	of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at
514	once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy
514	Brown's party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she
514	had 'nothing to wear'.  But these were mere trifles, and they assured
514	their mother that the experiment was working finely.  She smiled, said
514	nothing, and with Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home
514	pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly.  It was
514	astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was
514	produced by the 'resting and reveling' process.  The days kept getting
514	longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were
514	tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found
514	plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do.  As the height of luxury,
514	Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily,
514	that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to
514	furbish them up a la Moffat.  Jo read till her eyes gave out and she
514	was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a
514	quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished
514	she had gone with Aunt March.  Beth got on pretty well, for she was
514	constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell
514	back into her old ways now and then.  But something in the air affected
514	her, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so
514	that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her
514	she was 'a fright'.  Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were
514	small, and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found
514	that accomplished and important little self a great burden.  She didn't
514	like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn't draw all the
514	time.  Tea parties didn't amount to much, neither did picnics, unless
514	"very well conducted.  ""If one could have a fine house, full of nice"
514	girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at
514	home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try
514	"the patience of a Boaz,"" complained Miss Malaprop, after several days"
514	devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.
514	""
514	No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday
514	night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was
514	nearly done.  Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who
514	had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an
514	appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls
514	enjoy the full effect of the play system.
514	""
514	When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,
514	no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.
514	""
514	"""Mercy on us!  What has happened?"" cried Jo, staring about her in"
514	dismay.
514	""
514	Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather
514	bewildered, and a little ashamed.
514	""
514	"""Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay"
514	quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can.  It's a very
514	queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself.  But she
514	says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble but take
514	"care of ourselves."""
514	""
514	"""That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for something to"
514	"do, that is, some new amusement, you know,"" added Jo quickly."
514	""
514	In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and
514	they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's
514	"saying, ""Housekeeping ain't no joke.""  There was plenty of food in the"
514	larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,
514	wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.
514	""
514	"""I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think"
514	"of her, for she'd take care of herself,"" said Meg, who presided and"
514	felt quite matronly behind the teapot.
514	""
514	So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the
514	cook's compliments.  The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet
514	scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March
514	received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo
514	was gone.
514	""
514	"""Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid, but they"
514	"won't suffer, and it will do them good,"" she said, producing the more"
514	palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of
514	the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly
514	little deception for which they were grateful.
514	""
514	Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook
514	"at her failures.  ""Never mind, I'll get the dinner and be servant, you"
514	"be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,"" said"
514	Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.
514	""
514	This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the
514	parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the
514	sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting.  Jo, with
514	perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the
514	quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to
514	dinner.
514	""
514	"""You'd better see what you have got before you think of having"
514	"company,"" said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act."
514	""
514	"""Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some"
514	asparagus and a lobster, 'for a relish', as Hannah says. We'll have
514	lettuce and make a salad.  I don't know how, but the book tells.  I'll
514	have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you
514	"want to be elegant."""
514	""
514	"""Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but"
514	gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat.  I wash my hands of the
514	dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own
514	"responsibility, you may just take care of him."""
514	""
514	"""I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the"
514	"pudding.  You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?"""
514	asked Jo, rather hurt.
514	""
514	"""Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few trifles.  You"
514	"had better ask Mother's leave before you order anything,"" returned Meg"
514	prudently.
514	""
514	"""Of course I shall.  I'm not a fool.""  And Jo went off in a huff at the"
514	doubts expressed of her powers.
514	""
514	"""Get what you like, and don't disturb me.  I'm going out to dinner and"
514	"can't worry about things at home,"" said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to"
514	"her.  ""I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation"
514	"today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself."""
514	""
514	The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and
514	reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural
514	phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic
514	eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.
514	""
514	"""Everything is out of sorts, somehow,"" she said to herself, going"
514	"downstairs.  ""There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that something is"
514	"wrong in this family.  If Amy is bothering, I'll shake her."""
514	""
514	Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to
514	find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with
514	his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for
514	want of which he had died.
514	""
514	"""It's all my fault, I forgot him, there isn't a seed or a drop left."
514	"Oh, Pip!  Oh, Pip!  How could I be so cruel to you?"" cried Beth, taking"
514	the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.
514	""
514	Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding
514	him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for a
514	coffin.
514	""
514	"""Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,"" said Amy"
514	hopefully.
514	""
514	"""He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead.  I'll make"
514	him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I'll never have
514	"another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,"" murmured"
514	Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.
514	""
514	"""The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go.  Now, don't"
514	cry, Bethy.  It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has
514	had the worst of the experiment.  Make the shroud, and lay him in my
514	"box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice little funeral,"""
514	said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.
514	""
514	Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which
514	was in a most discouraging state of confusion.  Putting on a big apron,
514	she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when
514	she discovered that the fire was out.
514	""
514	"""Here's a sweet prospect!"" muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open,"
514	and poking vigorously among the cinders.
514	""
514	Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the
514	water heated.  The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself
514	that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a
514	very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid
514	strawberries.  By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and
514	the stove was red-hot.  Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had
514	worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and
514	forgotten it.  Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when
514	the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure
514	appeared, demanding tartly...
514	""
514	"""I say, isn't bread 'riz' enough when it runs over the pans?"""
514	""
514	Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high
514	as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the
514	sour bread into the oven without further delay.  Mrs. March went out,
514	after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a
514	word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear
514	departed lay in state in the domino box.  A strange sense of
514	helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the
514	corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker
514	appeared, and said she'd come to dinner.  Now this lady was a thin,
514	yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw
514	everything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had
514	been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and
514	had few friends.  So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain
514	her, while she asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories
514	of the people whom she knew.
514	""
514	Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions
514	which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a
514	standing joke.  Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,
514	and discovered that something more than energy and good will is
514	necessary to make a cook.  She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was
514	grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.
514	The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that
514	she could not make it fit to eat.  The lobster was a scarlet mystery to
514	her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager
514	proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves.  The potatoes had
514	to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at
514	the last.  The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe
514	as they looked, having been skilfully 'deaconed'.
514	""
514	"""Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only"
514	"it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,"""
514	thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and
514	stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before
514	Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose
514	tattling tongue would report them far and wide.
514	""
514	Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after
514	another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,
514	Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all
514	his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene.  Jo's one
514	strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a
514	pitcher of rich cream to eat with it.  Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle,
514	and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and
514	everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea
514	of cream.  Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some
514	water hastily.  Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough,
514	for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but
514	he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his
514	mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate.  Amy, who was fond of
514	delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her
514	napkin, and left the table precipitately.
514	""
514	"""Oh, what is it?"" exclaimed Jo, trembling."
514	""
514	"""Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,"" replied Meg with a"
514	tragic gesture.
514	""
514	Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had
514	given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes
514	on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the
514	refrigerator.  She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when
514	she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic
514	efforts.  The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she
514	laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.  So did everyone else, even
514	'Croaker' as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner
514	ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.
514	""
514	"""I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober"
514	"ourselves with a funeral,"" said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made"
514	ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's
514	dinner table.
514	""
514	They did sober themselves for Beth's sake.  Laurie dug a grave under
514	the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his
514	tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of
514	violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,
514	composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.
514	""
514	    Here lies Pip March,
514	    Who died the 7th of June;
514	    Loved and lamented sore,
514	    And not forgotten soon.
514	""
514	At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome
514	with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, for the
514	beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up
514	the pillows and putting things in order.  Meg helped Jo clear away the
514	remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so
514	tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.
514	""
514	Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour
514	cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper.  Mrs. March came
514	home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the
514	afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success
514	of one part of the experiment.
514	""
514	Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was
514	a scramble to get ready to see them.  Then tea must be got, errands
514	done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last
514	minute.  As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on
514	the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each
514	groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.
514	""
514	"""What a dreadful day this has been!"" began Jo, usually the first to"
514	speak.
514	""
514	"""It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,"" said Meg."
514	""
514	"""Not a bit like home,"" added Amy."
514	""
514	"""It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip,"" sighed Beth, glancing"
514	with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.
514	""
514	"""Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you"
514	"want it."""
514	""
514	As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as
514	if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.
514	""
514	"""Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another"
514	"week of it?"" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned"
514	toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.
514	""
514	"""I don't!"" cried Jo decidedly."
514	""
514	"""Nor I,"" echoed the others."
514	""
514	"""You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a"
514	"little for others, do you?"""
514	""
514	"""Lounging and larking doesn't pay,"" observed Jo, shaking her head. ""I'm"
514	"tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off."""
514	""
514	"""Suppose you learn plain cooking.  That's a useful accomplishment,"
514	"which no woman should be without,"" said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly"
514	at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for she had met Miss Crocker
514	and heard her account of it.
514	""
514	"""Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we'd"
514	"get on?"" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day."
514	""
514	"""Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing"
514	her share faithfully.  While Hannah and I did your work, you got on
514	pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable.  So I
514	thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when
514	everyone thinks only of herself.  Don't you feel that it is pleasanter
514	to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when
514	it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and
514	"lovely to us all?"""

514	"""Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for"
514	though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as
514	we learn to carry them.  Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for
514	everyone.  It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and
514	spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than

514	better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as
514	"they are."" said Meg."

514	"""I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music"
514	and dolls.  I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not
514	"playing,"" was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their example by"
514	"heroically declaring, ""I shall learn to make buttonholes, and attend to"
514	"my parts of speech."""

514	"""Very good!  Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy"
514	that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the other extreme
514	and delve like slaves.  Have regular hours for work and play, make each
514	day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth
514	of time by employing it well.  Then youth will be delightful, old age
514	will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite

514	CHAPTER TWELVE
514	""
514	CAMP LAURENCE
514	""
514	Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it
514	regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door
514	and distributing the mail.  One July day she came in with her hands
514	full, and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the
514	penny post.
514	""
514	"""Here's your posy, Mother!  Laurie never forgets that,"" she said,"
514	putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in 'Marmee's corner',
514	and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.
514	""
514	"""Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,"" continued Beth, delivering"
514	the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching
514	wristbands.
514	""
514	"""Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,"" said Meg,"
514	"looking at the gray cotton glove.  ""Didn't you drop the other in the"
514	"garden?"""
514	""
514	"""No, I'm sure I didn't, for there was only one in the office."""
514	""
514	"""I hate to have odd gloves!  Never mind, the other may be found.  My"
514	letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted.  I think Mr.
514	"Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing."""
514	""
514	Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham
514	morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and
514	very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full of tidy
514	white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother's mind as she
514	sewed and sang, while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied
514	with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt,
514	that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied.
514	""
514	"""Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered"
514	"the whole post office and stuck outside,"" said Beth, laughing as she"
514	went into the study where Jo sat writing.
514	""
514	"""What a sly fellow Laurie is!  I said I wished bigger hats were the"
514	fashion, because I burn my face every hot day.  He said, 'Why mind the
514	fashion?  Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I would if I had
514	one, and he has sent me this, to try me.  I'll wear it for fun, and
514	"show him I don't care for the fashion.""  And hanging the antique"
514	broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.
514	""
514	One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said
514	to her...
514	""
514	""
514	My Dear:
514	""
514	I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch
514	your efforts to control your temper.  You say nothing about your
514	trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no one sees
514	them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the
514	well-worn cover of your guidebook.  I, too, have seen them all, and
514	heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins
514	to bear fruit.  Go on, dear, patiently and bravely, and always believe
514	that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving...
514	""
514	Mother
514	""
514	""
514	"""That does me good!  That's worth millions of money and pecks of"
514	praise.  Oh, Marmee, I do try!  I will keep on trying, and not get
514	"tired, since I have you to help me."""
514	""
514	Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy
514	tears, for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts
514	to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,
514	because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most
514	valued.  Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon,
514	she pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest
514	she be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite
514	ready for either good or bad news.  In a big, dashing hand, Laurie
514	wrote...
514	""
514	Dear Jo, What ho!
514	""
514	Some English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to
514	have a jolly time.  If it's fine, I'm going to pitch my tent in
514	Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet--have a
514	fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks.  They are
514	nice people, and like such things.  Brooke will go to keep us boys
514	steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls.  I want you
514	all to come, can't let Beth off at any price, and nobody shall worry
514	her.  Don't bother about rations, I'll see to that and everything else,
514	only do come, there's a good fellow!
514	""
514	In a tearing hurry, Yours ever, Laurie.
514	""
514	"""Here's richness!"" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg."
514	""
514	"""Of course we can go, Mother?  It will be such a help to Laurie, for I"
514	can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some
514	"way."""
514	""
514	"""I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people.  Do you know anything"
514	"about them, Jo?"" asked Meg."
514	""
514	"""Only that there are four of them.  Kate is older than you, Fred and"
514	Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or
514	ten.  Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys.  I fancied, from the
514	way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn't admire
514	"Kate much."""
514	""
514	"""I'm so glad my French print is clean, it's just the thing and so"
514	"becoming!"" observed Meg complacently.  ""Have you anything decent, Jo?"""
514	""
514	"""Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me.  I shall row and"
514	tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of.  You'll come,
514	"Betty?"""
514	""
514	"""If you won't let any boys talk to me."""
514	""
514	"""Not a boy!"""
514	""
514	"""I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so"
514	kind.  But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. I'll work
514	hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me, Jo, so I'll
514	"go."""
514	""
514	"""That's my good girl.  You do try to fight off your shyness, and I love"
514	you for it.  Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know, and a cheery word
514	"kind of gives a lift.  Thank you, Mother,"" And Jo gave the thin cheek a"
514	grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back
514	the rosy roundness of her youth.
514	""
514	"""I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,"""
514	said Amy, showing her mail.
514	""
514	"""And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to"
514	"him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,"" added Beth,"
514	whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.
514	""
514	"""Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play"
514	"tomorrow with free minds,"" said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a"
514	broom.
514	""
514	When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning to promise
514	them a fine day, he saw a comical sight.  Each had made such
514	preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an
514	extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously
514	anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to
514	bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had
514	capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the
514	offending feature.  It was one of the kind artists use to hold the
514	paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and
514	effective for the purpose it was now being put.  This funny spectacle
514	appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo
514	woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.
514	""
514	Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a
514	lively bustle began in both houses.  Beth, who was ready first, kept
514	reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters' toilets by
514	frequent telegrams from the window.
514	""
514	"""There goes the man with the tent!  I see Mrs. Barker doing up the"
514	lunch in a hamper and a great basket.  Now Mr. Laurence is looking up
514	at the sky and the weathercock.  I wish he would go too.  There's
514	Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy!  Oh, mercy me!  Here's a
514	carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful
514	boys.  One is lame, poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell
514	us that.  Be quick, girls!  It's getting late. Why, there is Ned
514	Moffat, I do declare.  Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day
514	"when we were shopping?"""
514	""
514	"""So it is.  How queer that he should come.  I thought he was at the"
514	mountains.  There is Sallie.  I'm glad she got back in time. Am I all
514	"right, Jo?"" cried Meg in a flutter."
514	""
514	"""A regular daisy.  Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it"
514	looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff.
514	"Now then, come on!"""
514	""
514	"""Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat?  It's too absurd!"
514	"You shall not make a guy of yourself,"" remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied"
514	down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie
514	had sent for a joke.
514	""
514	"""I just will, though, for it's capital, so shady, light, and big. It"
514	"will make fun, and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable."" With"
514	that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed, a bright little
514	band of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy
514	faces under the jaunty hatbrims.
514	""
514	Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial
514	manner.  The lawn was the reception room, and for several minutes a
514	lively scene was enacted there.  Meg was grateful to see that Miss
514	Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls
514	would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned's
514	assurances that he came especially to see her.  Jo understood why
514	Laurie 'primmed up his mouth' when speaking of Kate, for that young
514	lady had a standoff-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with
514	the free and easy demeanor of the other girls.  Beth took an
514	observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not
514	'dreadful', but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that
514	account.  Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and
514	after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly
514	became very good friends.
514	""
514	Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the
514	party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving
514	Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore.  Laurie and Jo rowed one
514	boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous
514	twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a
514	disturbed water bug.  Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it
514	was of general utility.  It broke the ice in the beginning by producing
514	a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as
514	she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if
514	a shower came up, she said.  Miss Kate decided that she was 'odd', but
514	rather clever, and smiled upon her from afar.
514	""
514	Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with
514	the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with
514	uncommon 'skill and dexterity'.  Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young
514	man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice.  Meg liked his
514	quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful
514	knowledge.  He never talked to her much, but he looked at her a good
514	deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion.  Ned,
514	being in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it
514	their bounden duty to assume.  He was not very wise, but very
514	good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic.
514	Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and
514	chattering with the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror
514	by his pranks.
514	""
514	It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets
514	down by the time they arrived.  A pleasant green field, with three
514	wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for
514	croquet.
514	""
514	"""Welcome to Camp Laurence!"" said the young host, as they landed with"
514	exclamations of delight.
514	""
514	"""Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the other"
514	fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. The tent is
514	for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is
514	the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen.  Now, let's have a game
514	"before it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner."""
514	""
514	Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the
514	other eight.  Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took Sallie,
514	Jo, and Ned.  The English played well, but the Americans played better,
514	and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of
514	'76 inspired them.  Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once
514	narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had
514	missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal.  Fred was
514	close behind her and his turn came before hers.  He gave a stroke, his
514	ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side.  No one was
514	very near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his
514	toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.
514	""
514	"""I'm through!  Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,"" cried"
514	the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.
514	""
514	"""You pushed it.  I saw you.  It's my turn now,"" said Jo sharply."
514	""
514	"""Upon my word, I didn't move it.  It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is"
514	"allowed.  So, stand off please, and let me have a go at the stake."""
514	""
514	"""We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,"" said Jo"
514	angrily.
514	""
514	"""Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows.  There you go!"""
514	returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.
514	""
514	Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,
514	colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket
514	with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out
514	with much exultation.  She went off to get her ball, and was a long
514	time finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and
514	quiet, and waited her turn patiently.  It took several strokes to
514	regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side
514	had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the last but one and lay near the
514	stake.
514	""
514	"""By George, it's all up with us!  Goodbye, Kate.  Miss Jo owes me one,"
514	"so you are finished,"" cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to"
514	see the finish.
514	""
514	"""Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,"" said Jo,"
514	"with a look that made the lad redden, ""especially when they beat them,"""
514	she added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a
514	clever stroke.
514	""
514	Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult
514	over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer
514	"to whisper to his friend, ""Good for you, Jo!  He did cheat, I saw him."
514	"We can't tell him so, but he won't do it again, take my word for it."""
514	""
514	Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and
514	"said approvingly, ""It was dreadfully provoking, but you kept your"
514	"temper, and I'm so glad, Jo."""
514	""
514	"""Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should"
514	certainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the nettles till I
514	got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue. It's simmering now,
514	"so I hope he'll keep out of my way,"" returned Jo, biting her lips as"
514	she glowered at Fred from under her big hat.
514	""
514	"""Time for lunch,"" said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch. ""Commissary"
514	general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss March, Miss
514	"Sallie, and I spread the table?  Who can make good coffee?"""
514	""
514	"""Jo can,"" said Meg, glad to recommend her sister.  So Jo, feeling that"
514	her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over
514	the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys
514	made a fire and got water from a spring near by.  Miss Kate sketched
514	and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes
514	to serve as plates.
514	""
514	The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an
514	inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with
514	green leaves.  Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone
514	settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and
514	exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for
514	everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter
514	startled a venerable horse who fed near by.  There was a pleasing
514	inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and
514	plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the
514	refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down
514	from the tree to see what was going on.  Three white-headed children
514	peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the
514	other side of the river with all his might and main.
514	""
514	"""There's salt here,"" said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of berries."
514	""
514	"""Thank you, I prefer spiders,"" she replied, fishing up two unwary"
514	"little ones who had gone to a creamy death.  ""How dare you remind me of"
514	"that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?"" added"
514	Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run
514	short.
514	""
514	"""I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet."
514	This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do anything.  It's you and
514	Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I'm no end obliged to you.  What
514	"shall we do when we can't eat anymore?"" asked Laurie, feeling that his"
514	trump card had been played when lunch was over.
514	""
514	"""Have games till it's cooler.  I brought Authors, and I dare say Miss"
514	Kate knows something new and nice.  Go and ask her.  She's company, and
514	"you ought to stay with her more."""
514	""
514	"""Aren't you company too?  I thought she'd suit Brooke, but he keeps"
514	talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous
514	glass of hers.  I'm going, so you needn't try to preach propriety, for
514	"you can't do it, Jo."""
514	""
514	Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and
514	the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing
514	room to play Rig-marole.
514	""
514	"""One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as"
514	he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when
514	the next takes it up and does the same.  It's very funny when well
514	done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh
514	"over.  Please start it, Mr. Brooke,"" said Kate, with a commanding air,"
514	which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any
514	other gentleman.
514	""
514	Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke
514	obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed
514	upon the sunshiny river.
514	""
514	"""Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,"
514	for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He traveled a long
514	while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till
514	he came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to
514	anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he
514	was very fond.  The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely,
514	for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new
514	master, though he was freakish and wild.  Every day, when he gave his
514	lessons to this pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the
514	city, and as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful
514	face, which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found.  One
514	day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a
514	ruinous castle the lovely face.  He was delighted, inquired who lived
514	in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were
514	kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their
514	liberty.  The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he
514	was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and
514	longing to see it out in the sunshine.  At last he resolved to get into
514	the castle and ask how he could help them.  He went and knocked.  The
514	"great door flew open, and he beheld..."""
514	""
514	"""A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, 'At"
514	"last!  At last!'"" continued Kate, who had read French novels, and"
514	"admired the style.  ""'Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her"
514	feet in an ecstasy of joy.  'Oh, rise!' she said, extending a hand of
514	marble fairness.  'Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue you,' swore
514	the knight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain
514	here till my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?' 'In the
514	mauve salon.  Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 'I obey, and
514	return victorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away,
514	and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when
514	"he received..."""
514	""
514	"""A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a"
514	"black gown fired at him,"" said Ned.  ""Instantly, Sir What's-his-name"
514	recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to
514	join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow, found the door
514	locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when
514	the ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet
514	below.  Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came
514	to a little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads
514	together till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling
514	exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a
514	pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as
514	your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss
514	March.  At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took
514	"his breath away and chilled his blood..."""
514	""
514	"""A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in"
514	"its wasted hand,"" went on Meg.  ""It beckoned, gliding noiselessly"
514	before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb.  Shadowy
514	effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the
514	lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face
514	toward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil.
514	They reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music.  He
514	sprang forward to enter, but the specter plucked him back, and waved
514	"threateningly before him a..."""
514	""
514	"""Snuffbox,"" said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the"
514	"audience.  ""'Thankee,' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch and"
514	sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off.  'Ha! Ha!'
514	laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the
514	princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her
514	victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other
514	knights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all
514	"rose and began to..."""
514	""
514	"""Dance a hornpipe,"" cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, ""and, as they"
514	danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail.
514	'Up with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard alee, and man
514	the guns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight,
514	with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. 'Go in and win, my
514	hearties!' says the captain, and a tremendous fight began.  Of course
514	"the British beat--they always do."""
514	""
514	"""No, they don't!"" cried Jo, aside."
514	""
514	"""Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the"
514	schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers
514	ran blood, for the order had been 'Cutlasses, and die hard!' 'Bosun's
514	mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if
514	he doesn't confess his sins double quick,' said the British captain.
514	The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank,
514	while the jolly tars cheered like mad.  But the sly dog dived, came up
514	under the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail
514	"set, 'To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea' where..."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, gracious!  What shall I say?"" cried Sallie, as Fred ended his"
514	rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases
514	"and facts out of one of his favorite books. ""Well, they went to the"
514	bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on
514	finding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine,
514	hoping to discover the mystery about them, for being a woman, she was
514	curious.  By-and-by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, 'I'll give
514	you a box of pearls if you can take it up,' for she wanted to restore
514	the poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself.  So
514	the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to
514	find no pearls.  He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found
514	"by a..."""
514	""
514	"""Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,"" said"
514	"Amy, when Sallie's invention gave out.  ""The little girl was sorry for"
514	them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them.  'Your
514	geese will tell you, they know everything.' said the old woman.  So she
514	asked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,
514	"and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed..."""
514	""
514	"""'Cabbages!'"" continued Laurie promptly.  ""'Just the thing,' said the"
514	girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,
514	the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way
514	rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other
514	heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it.  The
514	knight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and
514	learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and
514	married, but one.  He was in a great state of mind at that, and
514	mounting the colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to
514	the castle to see which was left.  Peeping over the hedge, he saw the
514	queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden.  'Will you give
514	me a rose?' said he.  'You must come and get it.  I can't come to you,
514	it isn't proper,' said she, as sweet as honey.  He tried to climb over
514	the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher.  Then he tried to
514	push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair.
514	So he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole
514	through which he peeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in!  Let me in!'
514	But the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her
514	roses quietly, and left him to fight his way in.  Whether he did or
514	"not, Frank will tell you."""
514	""
514	"""I can't.  I'm not playing, I never do,"" said Frank, dismayed at the"
514	sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd
514	couple.  Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.
514	""
514	"""So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?"" asked"
514	Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in
514	his buttonhole.
514	""
514	"""I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a"
514	"while,"" said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his"
514	tutor.
514	""
514	"""What a piece of nonsense we have made!  With practice we might do"
514	"something quite clever.  Do you know Truth?"""
514	""
514	"""I hope so,"" said Meg soberly."
514	""
514	"""The game, I mean?"""
514	""
514	"""What is it?"" said Fred."
514	""
514	"""Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn,"
514	and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question
514	"put by the rest.  It's great fun."""
514	""
514	"""Let's try it,"" said Jo, who liked new experiments."
514	""
514	Miss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo,

514	""
514	"""Try again.  Truth isn't a bad game,"" said Fred."
514	""
514	"""It's a very good one for you,"" retorted Jo in a low voice. Her turn"
514	came next.

514	"""What is your greatest fault?"" asked Fred, by way of testing in her the"
514	virtue he lacked himself.
514	""
514	"""A quick temper."""

514	"""Not a true answer.  You must say what you really do want most."""
514	""
514	"""Genius.  Don't you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?"" And she"
514	slyly smiled in his disappointed face.
514	""
514	"""What virtues do you most admire in a man?"" asked Sallie."
514	""
514	"""Courage and honesty."""
514	""
514	"""Now my turn,"" said Fred, as his hand came last."

514	"""Let's give it to him,"" whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded and asked at"
514	once...
514	""
514	"""Didn't you cheat at croquet?"""
514	""
514	"""Well, yes, a little bit."""
514	""
514	"""Good!  Didn't you take your story out of _The Sea Lion?_"" said Laurie."
514	""
514	"""Rather."""
514	""
514	"""Don't you think the English nation perfect in every respect?"" asked"
514	Sallie.

514	"""He's a true John Bull.  Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance"
514	without waiting to draw.  I'll harrrow up your feelings first by asking
514	"if you don't think you are something of a flirt,"" said Laurie, as Jo"
514	nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.
514	""
514	"""You impertinent boy!  Of course I'm not,"" exclaimed Sallie, with an"
514	air that proved the contrary.

514	"of Authors to refresh our minds,"" proposed Jo."
514	""
514	Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went on,
514	the three elders sat apart, talking.  Miss Kate took out her sketch
514	again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with
514	a book, which he did not read.
514	""
514	"""How beautifully you do it!  I wish I could draw,"" said Meg, with"
514	mingled admiration and regret in her voice.

514	"""Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy.  So did mine, but I"

514	"""I have none."""

514	"""I don't go at all.  I am a governess myself."""

514	"""Oh, indeed!"" said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said, ""Dear"
514	"me, how dreadful!"" for her tone implied it, and something in her face"
514	made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.
514	""
514	"Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, ""Young ladies in America love"

514	"respected for supporting themselves."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do so.  We"
514	have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and
514	are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of
514	"gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,"" said"
514	Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's pride, and made her
514	work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.

514	"""Did the German song suit, Miss March?"" inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking"
514	an awkward pause.

514	""
514	"""Not very well.  My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't get on"
514	"very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation."""
514	""
514	"""Try a little now.  Here is Schiller's Mary Stuart and a tutor who"

514	inviting smile.

514	"""It's so hard I'm afraid to try,"" said Meg, grateful, but bashful in"
514	the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.
514	""
514	"""I'll read a bit to encourage you."" And Miss Kate read one of the most"
514	beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless
514	manner.
514	""
514	Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg, who said
514	"innocently, ""I thought it was poetry."""

514	"""Some of it is.  Try this passage."""

514	There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he opened at poor
514	Mary's lament.

514	Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used
514	to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of
514	the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice.  Down the
514	page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in
514	the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little
514	touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen.  If she had seen
514	the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked
514	up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.

514	"""Very well indeed!"" said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her"
514	many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.

514	Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little
514	tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension,
514	"""You've a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader.  I advise"
514	you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers.  I
514	"must look after Grace, she is romping."" And Miss Kate strolled away,"
514	"adding to herself with a shrug, ""I didn't come to chaperone a"

514	lament her hard lot.
514	""
514	"""I'm glad I live in it then.  I don't like my work, but I get a good"

514	would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who
514	"stay at home,"" she added sorrowfully."

514	"""I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die,"""
514	said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the
514	hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.

514	"""Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all"
514	"be very sorry to have any harm happen to you,"" said Meg heartily."

514	again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old
514	horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the
514	young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.

514	"""Don't you love to ride?"" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting"
514	after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.

514	an old sidesaddle and no horse.  Out in our garden is an apple tree
514	that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some
514	reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree
514	"whenever we like."""
514	""
514	"""How funny!"" laughed Grace.  ""I have a pony at home, and ride nearly"

514	"""Dear, how charming!  I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I'd rather"
514	"go to Rome than the Row,"" said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what"
514	the Row was and wouldn't have asked for the world.

514	Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were
514	saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture
514	as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical
514	gymnastics.  Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards,
514	"looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, ""I'm afraid you are"
514	"tired.  Can I do anything for you?"""

514	If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a
514	more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to run to,

514	that she bravely resolved to try.

514	"""What do you like to talk about?"" she asked, fumbling over the cards"
514	and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.
514	""
514	"""Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,"" said"
514	Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.
514	""
514	My heart!  What shall I do?  I don't know anything about them, thought
514	Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry, she said,
514	"hoping to make him talk, ""I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you"
514	"know all about it."""
514	""
514	"""I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a"
514	confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds for

514	innocent blunder.
514	""
514	"""Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,"" she said,"
514	turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one
514	of the boys' books in which Jo delighted.
514	""
514	Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to
514	amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her
514	sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking
514	away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged
514	protection.
514	""
514	"""Bless her heart!  She pities him, so she is good to him,"" said Jo,"
514	beaming at her from the croquet ground.

514	cups.
514	""
514	"""My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,"" said"
514	Amy, well pleased at Beth's success.  She meant 'facinating', but as
514	Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either word, fastidious sounded
514	well and made a good impression.
514	""
514	An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet
514	finished the afternoon.  At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed,
514	wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the
514	river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental,
514	warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...

514	he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she laughed
514	outright and spoiled his song.
514	""
514	"""How can you be so cruel to me?"" he whispered, under cover of a lively"
514	"chorus.  ""You've kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day,"
514	"and now you snub me."""
514	""
514	"""I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't help it,"""
514	replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was
514	quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and
514	the talk after it.
514	""
514	Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her
514	"rather pettishly, ""There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?"""
514	""
514	"""Not a particle, but she's a dear,"" returned Sallie, defending her"
514	friend even while confessing her shortcomings.
514	""
514	"""She's not a stricken deer anyway,"" said Ned, trying to be witty, and"
514	succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.
514	""
514	On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with
514	cordial good nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada.
514	As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked
514	"after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, ""In"
514	spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when
514	"one knows them."""
514	""
514	"""I quite agree with you,"" said Mr. Brooke."

514	CHAPTER THIRTEEN
514	""
514	CASTLES IN THE AIR
514	""
514	Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm
514	September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too
514	lazy to go and find out.  He was in one of his moods, for the day had
514	been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could
514	live it over again.  The hot weather made him indolent, and he had
514	shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,
514	displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened
514	the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that
514	one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman
514	about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his
514	hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the
514	peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up
514	into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed
514	dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the
514	ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him
514	ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw
514	the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.
514	""
514	"""What in the world are those girls about now?"" thought Laurie, opening"
514	his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather
514	peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors.  Each wore a large,
514	flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried
514	a long staff.  Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a
514	portfolio.  All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little
514	back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and
514	river.
514	""
514	"""Well, that's cool,"" said Laurie to himself, ""to have a picnic and"
514	never ask me!  They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't got
514	the key.  Perhaps they forgot it.  I'll take it to them, and see what's
514	"going on."""
514	""
514	Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find
514	one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in
514	his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped
514	the fence and ran after them.  Taking the shortest way to the
514	boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went
514	up the hill to take an observation.  A grove of pines covered one part
514	of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than
514	the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.
514	""
514	"""Here's a landscape!"" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and"
514	looking wide-awake and good-natured already.
514	""
514	It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in
514	the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic
514	wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the
514	little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no
514	strangers but old friends.  Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily
514	with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her
514	pink dress among the green.  Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick
514	under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them.  Amy
514	was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud.
514	A shadow passed over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he
514	ought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed
514	very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his
514	restless spirit.  He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its
514	harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and
514	skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the
514	wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.
514	""
514	"""May I come in, please?  Or shall I be a bother?"" he asked, advancing"
514	slowly.
514	""
514	Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at
514	"once, ""Of course you may.  We should have asked you before, only we"
514	"thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this."""
514	""
514	"""I always like your games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll go away."""
514	""
514	"""I've no objection, if you do something.  It's against the rules to be"
514	"idle here,"" replied Meg gravely but graciously."
514	""
514	"""Much obliged.  I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, for it's"
514	as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there.  Shall I sew, read, cone,
514	"draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I'm ready.""  And Laurie"
514	sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.
514	""
514	"""Finish this story while I set my heel,"" said Jo, handing him the book."
514	""
514	"""Yes'm."" was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his"
514	gratitude for the favor of admission into the 'Busy Bee Society'.
514	""
514	The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured to
514	ask a few questions as a reward of merit.
514	""
514	"""Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming"
514	"institution is a new one?"""
514	""
514	"""Would you tell him?"" asked Meg of her sisters."
514	""
514	"""He'll laugh,"" said Amy warningly."
514	""
514	"""Who cares?"" said Jo."
514	""
514	"""I guess he'll like it,"" added Beth."
514	""
514	"""Of course I shall!  I give you my word I won't laugh.  Tell away, Jo,"
514	"and don't be afraid."""
514	""
514	"""The idea of being afraid of you!  Well, you see we used to play"
514	Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, all
514	"winter and summer."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, I know,"" said Laurie, nodding wisely."
514	""
514	"""Who told you?"" demanded Jo."
514	""
514	"""Spirits."""
514	""
514	"""No, I did.  I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away,"
514	"and he was rather dismal.  He did like it, so don't scold, Jo,"" said"
514	Beth meekly.
514	""
514	"""You can't keep a secret.  Never mind, it saves trouble now."""
514	""
514	"""Go on, please,"" said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work,"
514	looking a trifle displeased.
514	""
514	"""Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours?  Well, we have"
514	tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at
514	it with a will.  The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,
514	"and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, I should think so,"" and Laurie thought regretfully of his own"
514	idle days.
514	""
514	"""Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring"
514	our work here and have nice times.  For the fun of it we bring our
514	things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,
514	and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago.  We call this hill the
514	Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where
514	"we hope to live some time."""
514	""
514	Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the
514	wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the
514	other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green
514	hills that rose to meet the sky.  The sun was low, and the heavens
514	glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset.  Gold and purple clouds
514	lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery
514	white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.
514	""
514	"""How beautiful that is!"" said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see"
514	and feel beauty of any kind.
514	""
514	"""It's often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but"
514	"always splendid,"" replied Amy, wishing she could paint it."
514	""
514	"""Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime--the real"
514	country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It would be
514	nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could
514	"ever go to it,"" said Beth musingly."
514	""
514	"""There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go,"
514	"by-and-by, when we are good enough,"" answered Meg with her sweetest"
514	voice.
514	""
514	"""It seems so long to wait, so hard to do.  I want to fly away at once,"
514	"as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate."""
514	""
514	"""You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,"" said Jo."
514	"""I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and"
514	"maybe never get in after all."""
514	""
514	"""You'll have me for company, if that's any comfort.  I shall have to do"
514	a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City.  If
514	"I arrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you, Beth?"""
514	""
514	Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend, but she said
514	"cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, ""If people"
514	really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will
514	get in, for I don't believe there are any locks on that door or any
514	guards at the gate.  I always imagine it is as it is in the picture,
514	where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor
514	"Christian as he comes up from the river."""
514	""
514	"""Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could"
514	"come true, and we could live in them?"" said Jo, after a little pause."
514	""
514	"""I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd have,"""
514	said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had
514	betrayed him.
514	""
514	"""You'd have to take your favorite one.  What is it?"" asked Meg."
514	""
514	"""If I tell mine, will you tell yours?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, if the girls will too."""
514	""
514	"""We will.  Now, Laurie."""
514	""
514	"""After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle"
514	in Germany and have just as much music as I choose.  I'm to be a famous
514	musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me.  And I'm never
514	to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live
514	"for what I like.  That's my favorite castle. What's yours, Meg?"""
514	""
514	Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a
514	brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she
514	"said slowly, ""I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of"
514	luxurious things--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture,
514	pleasant people, and heaps of money.  I am to be mistress of it, and
514	manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a
514	bit.  How I should enjoy it!  For I wouldn't be idle, but do good, and
514	"make everyone love me dearly."""
514	""
514	"""Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?"" asked Laurie"
514	slyly.
514	""
514	"""I said 'pleasant people', you know,"" and Meg carefully tied up her"
514	shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.
514	""
514	"""Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband and some"
514	angelic little children?  You know your castle wouldn't be perfect
514	"without,"" said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather"
514	scorned romance, except in books.
514	""
514	"""You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,"""
514	answered Meg petulantly.
514	""
514	"""Wouldn't I though?  I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms"
514	piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, so that
514	my works should be as famous as Laurie's music.  I want to do something
514	splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that
514	won't be forgotten after I'm dead.  I don't know what, but I'm on the
514	watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day.  I think I shall
514	write books, and get rich and famous, that would suit me, so that is my
514	"favorite dream."""
514	""
514	"""Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take"
514	"care of the family,"" said Beth contentedly."
514	""
514	"""Don't you wish for anything else?"" asked Laurie."
514	""
514	"""Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied.  I only wish we"
514	"may all keep well and be together, nothing else."""
514	""
514	"""I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go"
514	to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole
514	"world,"" was Amy's modest desire."
514	""
514	"""We're an ambitious set, aren't we?  Every one of us, but Beth, wants"
514	to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if
514	"any of us will ever get our wishes,"" said Laurie, chewing grass like a"
514	meditative calf.
514	""
514	"""I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the"
514	"door remains to be seen,"" observed Jo mysteriously."
514	""
514	"""I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang"
514	"college!"" muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh."
514	""
514	"""Here's mine!"" and Amy waved her pencil."
514	""
514	"""I haven't got any,"" said Meg forlornly."
514	""
514	"""Yes, you have,"" said Laurie at once."
514	""
514	"""Where?"""
514	""
514	"""In your face."""
514	""
514	"""Nonsense, that's of no use."""
514	""
514	"""Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,"" replied"
514	the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he
514	fancied he knew.
514	""
514	Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked across
514	the river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke had worn
514	when he told the story of the knight.
514	""
514	"""If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see how many of"
514	"us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now,"" said"
514	Jo, always ready with a plan.
514	""
514	"""Bless me!  How old I shall be, twenty-seven!"" exclaimed Meg, who felt"
514	grown up already, having just reached seventeen.
514	""
514	"""You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy"
514	"twenty-two.  What a venerable party!"" said Jo."
514	""
514	"""I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but"
514	"I'm such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall dawdle, Jo."""
514	""
514	"""You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is sure"
514	"you'll work splendidly."""
514	""
514	"""Is she?  By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!"" cried Laurie,"
514	"sitting up with sudden energy.  ""I ought to be satisfied to please"
514	Grandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain, you see,
514	and comes hard.  He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and
514	I'd rather be shot.  I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of
514	rubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the
514	bottom when I own them.  Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if
514	I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business.  But
514	he's set, and I've got to do just as he did, unless I break away and
514	please myself, as my father did.  If there was anyone left to stay with
514	"the old gentleman, I'd do it tomorrow."""
514	""
514	Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into
514	execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast
514	and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of
514	subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.
514	""
514	"""I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home"
514	"again till you have tried your own way,"" said Jo, whose imagination was"
514	fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was
514	excited by what she called 'Teddy's Wrongs'.
514	""
514	"""That's not right, Jo.  You mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie"
514	mustn't take your bad advice.  You should do just what your grandfather
514	"wishes, my dear boy,"" said Meg in her most maternal tone. ""Do your best"
514	at college, and when he sees that you try to please him, I'm sure he
514	won't be hard on you or unjust to you.  As you say, there is no one
514	else to stay with and love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you
514	left him without his permission.  Don't be dismal or fret, but do your
514	duty and you'll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being
514	"respected and loved."""
514	""
514	"""What do you know about him?"" asked Laurie, grateful for the good"
514	advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation
514	from himself after his unusual outbreak.
514	""
514	"""Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care of his"
514	own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice
514	person because he wouldn't leave her.  And how he provides now for an
514	old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as
514	"generous and patient and good as he can be."""
514	""
514	"""So he is, dear old fellow!"" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,"
514	"looking flushed and earnest with her story.  ""It's like Grandpa to find"
514	out all about him without letting him know, and to tell all his
514	goodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn't
514	understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me
514	and treating him in her beautiful friendly way.  He thought she was
514	just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about
514	you all in flaming style.  If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll
514	"do for Brooke."""
514	""
514	"""Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,"" said Meg"
514	sharply.
514	""
514	"""How do you know I do, Miss?"""
514	""
514	"""I can always tell by his face when he goes away.  If you have been"
514	good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly.  If you have plagued him,
514	he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work
514	"better."""
514	""
514	"""Well, I like that?  So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in"
514	Brooke's face, do you?  I see him bow and smile as he passes your
514	"window, but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph."""
514	""
514	"""We haven't.  Don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said anything!"
514	It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here
514	"is said in confidence, you know,"" cried Meg, much alarmed at the"
514	thought of what might follow from her careless speech.
514	""
514	"""I don't tell tales,"" replied Laurie, with his 'high and mighty' air,"
514	"as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. ""Only if"
514	Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather
514	"for him to report."""
514	""
514	"""Please don't be offended.  I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be"
514	silly.  I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd
514	be sorry for by-and-by.  You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were
514	"our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly."""
514	And Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.
514	""
514	Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,
514	"and said frankly, ""I'm the one to be forgiven.  I'm cross and have been"
514	out of sorts all day.  I like to have you tell me my faults and be
514	sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes.  I thank you all the
514	"same."""
514	""
514	Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable
514	as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook
514	down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a
514	fit person to belong to the 'Busy Bee Society'.  In the midst of an
514	animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those
514	amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound
514	of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea 'to draw', and they
514	would just have time to get home to supper.
514	""
514	"""May I come again?"" asked Laurie."
514	""
514	"""Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer"
514	"are told to do,"" said Meg, smiling."
514	""
514	"""I'll try."""
514	""
514	"""Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do."
514	"There's a demand for socks just now,"" added Jo, waving hers like a big"
514	blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.
514	""
514	That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie,
514	standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David,
514	whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old
514	man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts
514	of the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of
514	the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the
514	"sacrifice cheerfully, ""I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear"
514	"old gentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has."""

514	CHAPTER FOURTEEN
514	""
514	SECRETS
514	""
514	Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow
514	chilly, and the afternoons were short.  For two or three hours the sun
514	lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,
514	writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,
514	while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied
514	by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of
514	his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the
514	last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and
514	threw down her pen, exclaiming...
514	""
514	"""There, I've done my best!  If this won't suit I shall have to wait"
514	"till I can do better."""
514	""
514	Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,
514	making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,
514	which looked like little balloons.  Then she tied it up with a smart
514	red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful
514	expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been.  Jo's
514	desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall.  In it
514	she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble,
514	who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a
514	circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the
514	leaves.  From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and
514	putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her
514	friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.
514	""
514	She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to
514	the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung
514	herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.
514	Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled
514	away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.
514	""
514	If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements
514	decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till
514	she reached a certain number in a certain busy street.  Having found
514	the place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up
514	the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly
514	dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came.  This
514	maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a
514	black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building
514	opposite.  On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,
514	pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if
514	she were going to have all her teeth out.
514	""
514	There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,
514	and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly
514	opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young
514	gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself
514	"in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, ""It's like"
514	her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need someone to
514	"help her home."""
514	""
514	In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the
514	general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying
514	ordeal of some sort.  When she saw the young gentleman she looked
514	anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod.  But he followed,
514	"asking with an air of sympathy, ""Did you have a bad time?"""
514	""
514	"""Not very."""
514	""
514	"""You got through quickly."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, thank goodness!"""
514	""
514	"""Why did you go alone?"""
514	""
514	"""Didn't want anyone to know."""
514	""
514	"""You're the oddest fellow I ever saw.  How many did you have out?"""
514	""
514	Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then began to
514	laugh as if mightily amused at something.
514	""
514	"""There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week."""
514	""
514	"""What are you laughing at?  You are up to some mischief, Jo,"" said"
514	Laurie, looking mystified.
514	""
514	"""So are you.  What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?"""
514	""
514	"""Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a"
514	"gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing."""
514	""
514	"""I'm glad of that."""
514	""
514	"""Why?"""
514	""
514	"""You can teach me, and then when we play _Hamlet_, you can be Laertes,"
514	"and we'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene."""
514	""
514	Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several
514	passers-by smile in spite of themselves.
514	""
514	"""I'll teach you whether we play _Hamlet_ or not.  It's grand fun and"
514	will straighten you up capitally.  But I don't believe that was your
514	"only reason for saying 'I'm glad' in that decided way, was it now?"""
514	""
514	"""No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you"
514	"never go to such places.  Do you?"""
514	""
514	"""Not often."""
514	""
514	"""I wish you wouldn't."""
514	""
514	"""It's no harm, Jo.  I have billiards at home, but it's no fun unless"
514	you have good players, so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes and have
514	"a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and better,"
514	and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys.  I
514	"did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends,"""
514	said Jo, shaking her head.
514	""
514	"""Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without"
514	"losing his respectability?"" asked Laurie, looking nettled."
514	""
514	"""That depends upon how and where he takes it.  I don't like Ned and his"
514	set, and wish you'd keep out of it.  Mother won't let us have him at
514	our house, though he wants to come.  And if you grow like him she won't
514	"be willing to have us frolic together as we do now."""
514	""
514	"""Won't she?"" asked Laurie anxiously."
514	""
514	"""No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us all up in"
514	"bandboxes rather than have us associate with them."""
514	""
514	"""Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet.  I'm not a fashionable"
514	party and don't mean to be, but I do like harmless larks now and then,
514	"don't you?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you?"
514	"Or there will be an end of all our good times."""
514	""
514	"""I'll be a double distilled saint."""
514	""
514	"""I can't bear saints.  Just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and"
514	we'll never desert you.  I don't know what I should do if you acted
514	like Mr. King's son.  He had plenty of money, but didn't know how to
514	spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his
514	"father's name, I believe, and was altogether horrid."""
514	""
514	"""You think I'm likely to do the same?  Much obliged."""
514	""
514	"""No, I don't--oh, dear, no!--but I hear people talking about money"
514	being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor. I
514	"shouldn't worry then."""
514	""
514	"""Do you worry about me, Jo?"""
514	""
514	"""A little, when you look moody and discontented, as you sometimes do,"
514	for you've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I'm
514	"afraid it would be hard to stop you."""
514	""
514	Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she
514	had held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips smiled
514	as if at her warnings.
514	""
514	"""Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?"" he asked"
514	presently.
514	""
514	"""Of course not.  Why?"""
514	""
514	"""Because if you are, I'll take a bus.  If you're not, I'd like to walk"
514	"with you and tell you something very interesting."""
514	""
514	"""I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news immensely."""
514	""
514	"""Very well, then, come on.  It's a secret, and if I tell you, you must"
514	"tell me yours."""
514	""
514	"""I haven't got any,"" began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that"
514	she had.
514	""
514	"""You know you have--you can't hide anything, so up and 'fess, or I"
514	"won't tell,"" cried Laurie."
514	""
514	"""Is your secret a nice one?"""
514	""
514	"""Oh, isn't it!  All about people you know, and such fun!  You ought to"
514	hear it, and I've been aching to tell it this long time. Come, you
514	"begin."""
514	""
514	"""You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?"""
514	""
514	"""Not a word."""
514	""
514	"""And you won't tease me in private?"""
514	""
514	"""I never tease."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, you do.  You get everything you want out of people.  I don't know"
514	"how you do it, but you are a born wheedler."""
514	""
514	"""Thank you.  Fire away."""
514	""
514	"""Well, I've left two stories with a newspaperman, and he's to give his"
514	"answer next week,"" whispered Jo, in her confidant's ear."
514	""
514	"""Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!"" cried"
514	Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight
514	of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children,
514	for they were out of the city now.
514	""
514	"""Hush!  It won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't rest till"
514	I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn't want anyone
514	"else to be disappointed."""
514	""
514	"""It won't fail.  Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare"
514	compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't it be
514	"fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of our authoress?"""
514	""
514	Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a
514	friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.
514	""
514	"""Where's your secret?  Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe you"
514	"again,"" she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed"
514	up at a word of encouragement.
514	""
514	"""I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise not to, so I"
514	will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you any plummy
514	"bit of news I get.  I know where Meg's glove is."""
514	""
514	"""Is that all?"" said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and"
514	twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.
514	""
514	"""It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell you"
514	"where it is."""
514	""
514	"""Tell, then."""
514	""
514	Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which produced a
514	comical change.  She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both
514	"surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, ""How do you"
514	"know?"""
514	""
514	"""Saw it."""
514	""
514	"""Where?"""
514	""
514	"""Pocket."""
514	""
514	"""All this time?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, isn't that romantic?"""
514	""
514	"""No, it's horrid."""
514	""
514	"""Don't you like it?"""
514	""
514	"""Of course I don't.  It's ridiculous, it won't be allowed.  My"
514	"patience!  What would Meg say?"""
514	""
514	"""You are not to tell anyone.  Mind that."""
514	""
514	"""I didn't promise."""
514	""
514	"""That was understood, and I trusted you."""
514	""
514	"""Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and wish you"
514	"hadn't told me."""
514	""
514	"""I thought you'd be pleased."""
514	""
514	"""At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you."""
514	""
514	"""You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away."""
514	""
514	"""I'd like to see anyone try it,"" cried Jo fiercely."
514	""
514	"""So should I!"" and Laurie chuckled at the idea."
514	""
514	"""I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind"
514	"since you told me that,"" said Jo rather ungratefully."
514	""
514	"""Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,"" suggested"
514	Laurie.
514	""
514	No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, and
514	finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat
514	and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie reached
514	the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his
514	treatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with flying hair, bright
514	eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.
514	""
514	"""I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air,"
514	and not lose my breath.  It was capital, but see what a guy it's made
514	"me.  Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you are,"" said Jo,"
514	dropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with
514	crimson leaves.
514	""
514	Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled
514	up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again.
514	But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking
514	particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been
514	making calls.
514	""
514	"""What in the world are you doing here?"" she asked, regarding her"
514	disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.
514	""
514	"""Getting leaves,"" meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had"
514	just swept up.
514	""
514	"""And hairpins,"" added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's lap."
514	"""They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw hats."""
514	""
514	"""You have been running, Jo.  How could you?  When will you stop such"
514	"romping ways?"" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and"
514	smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.
514	""
514	"""Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch.  Don't try to"
514	make me grow up before my time, Meg.  It's hard enough to have you
514	"change all of a sudden.  Let me be a little girl as long as I can."""
514	""
514	As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her
514	lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a
514	woman, and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which must
514	surely come some time and now seemed very near.  He saw the trouble in
514	"her face and drew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, ""Where"
514	"have you been calling, all so fine?"""
514	""
514	"""At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle"
514	Moffat's wedding.  It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend
514	"the winter in Paris.  Just think how delightful that must be!"""
514	""
514	"""Do you envy her, Meg?"" said Laurie."
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid I do."""
514	""
514	"""I'm glad of it!"" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk."
514	""
514	"""Why?"" asked Meg, looking surprised."
514	""
514	"""Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a"
514	"poor man,"" said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to"
514	mind what she said.
514	""
514	"""I shall never '_go_ and marry' anyone,"" observed Meg, walking on with"
514	great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping
514	stones, and 'behaving like children', as Meg said to herself, though
514	she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best
514	dress on.
514	""
514	For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite
514	bewildered.  She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to
514	Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a
514	woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in
514	a very mysterious manner.  Laurie and she were always making signs to
514	one another, and talking about 'Spread Eagles' till the girls declared
514	they had both lost their wits.  On the second Saturday after Jo got out
514	of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by
514	the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally
514	capturing her in Amy's bower.  What went on there, Meg could not see,
514	but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices
514	and a great flapping of newspapers.
514	""
514	"""What shall we do with that girl?  She never _will_ behave like a young"
514	"lady,"" sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face."
514	""
514	"""I hope she won't.  She is so funny and dear as she is,"" said Beth, who"
514	had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets
514	with anyone but her.
514	""
514	"""It's very trying, but we never can make her _commy la fo_,"" added Amy,"
514	who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a
514	very becoming way, two agreeable things that made her feel unusually
514	elegant and ladylike.
514	""
514	In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected
514	to read.
514	""
514	"""Have you anything interesting there?"" asked Meg, with condescension."
514	""
514	"""Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess,"" returned Jo,"
514	carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.
514	""
514	"""You'd better read it aloud.  That will amuse us and keep you out of"
514	"mischief,"" said Amy in her most grown-up tone."
514	""
514	"""What's the name?"" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind"
514	the sheet.
514	""
514	"""The Rival Painters."""
514	""
514	"""That sounds well.  Read it,"" said Meg."
514	""
514	"With a loud ""Hem!"" and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast.  The"
514	girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat
514	"pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. ""I like that about"
514	"the splendid picture,"" was Amy's approving remark, as Jo paused."
514	""
514	"""I prefer the lovering part.  Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite"
514	"names, isn't that queer?"" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the lovering"
514	part was tragical.
514	""
514	"""Who wrote it?"" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's face."
514	""
514	The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed
514	countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement
514	"replied in a loud voice, ""Your sister."""
514	""
514	"""You?"" cried Meg, dropping her work."
514	""
514	"""It's very good,"" said Amy critically."
514	""
514	"""I knew it!  I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!""  and Beth ran to hug"
514	her sister and exult over this splendid success.
514	""
514	Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure!  How Meg wouldn't
514	"believe it till she saw the words.  ""Miss Josephine March,"" actually"
514	printed in the paper.  How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts
514	of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately
514	couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead.  How Beth
514	got excited, and skipped and sang with joy.  How Hannah came in to
514	"exclaim, ""Sakes alive, well I never!"" in great astonishment at 'that"
514	Jo's doin's'.  How proud Mrs. March was when she knew it.  How Jo
514	laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a
514	peacock and done with it, and how the 'Spread Eagle' might be said to
514	flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper
514	passed from hand to hand.
514	""
514	"""Tell us about it.""  ""When did it come?"" ""How much did you get for it?"""
514	"""What will Father say?"" ""Won't Laurie laugh?"" cried the family, all in"
514	one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate
514	people made a jubilee of every little household joy.
514	""
514	"""Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything,"" said Jo,"
514	wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she did
514	over her 'Rival Painters'.  Having told how she disposed of her tales,
514	"Jo added, ""And when I went to get my answer, the man said he liked them"
514	both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and
514	noticed the stories.  It was good practice, he said, and when the
514	beginners improved, anyone would pay.  So I let him have the two
514	stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it
514	and insisted on seeing it, so I let him.  And he said it was good, and
514	I shall write more, and he's going to get the next paid for, and I am
514	so happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the
514	"girls."""
514	""
514	Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she
514	bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be
514	independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest
514	wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that
514	happy end.

514	""
514	"""November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,"" said"
514	Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking out at the
514	frostbitten garden.
514	""
514	"""That's the reason I was born in it,"" observed Jo pensively, quite"
514	unconscious of the blot on her nose.
514	""
514	"""If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a"
514	"delightful month,"" said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything,"
514	even November.
514	""
514	"""I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family,"""
514	"said Meg, who was out of sorts.  ""We go grubbing along day after day,"
514	without a bit of change, and very little fun.  We might as well be in a
514	"treadmill."""
514	""
514	"""My patience, how blue we are!"" cried Jo.  ""I don't much wonder, poor"
514	dear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you grind,
514	grind, year in and year out.  Oh, don't I wish I could manage things
514	for you as I do for my heroines!  You're pretty enough and good enough
514	already, so I'd have some rich relation leave you a fortune
514	unexpectedly.  Then you'd dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who
514	has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady Something in a blaze
514	"of splendor and elegance."""
514	""
514	"""People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, men have"
514	"to work and women marry for money.  It's a dreadfully unjust world,"""
514	said Meg bitterly.
514	""
514	"""Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all.  Just wait ten years,"
514	"and see if we don't,"" said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as"
514	Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.
514	""
514	"""Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and dirt,"
514	"though I'm grateful for your good intentions."""
514	""
514	Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again.  Jo groaned and
514	leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy
514	spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window,
514	"said, smiling, ""Two pleasant things are going to happen right away."
514	Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the
514	"garden as if he had something nice to tell."""
514	""
514	"In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, ""Any letter from"
514	"Father, girls?"" and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, ""Won't some of"
514	you come for a drive?  I've been working away at mathematics till my
514	head is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn.
514	It's a dull day, but the air isn't bad, and I'm going to take Brooke
514	home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn't out.  Come, Jo, you and
514	"Beth will go, won't you?"""
514	""
514	"""Of course we will."""
514	""
514	"""Much obliged, but I'm busy.""  And Meg whisked out her workbasket, for"
514	she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least, not
514	to drive too often with the young gentleman.
514	""
514	"""We three will be ready in a minute,"" cried Amy, running away to wash"
514	her hands.
514	""
514	"""Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?"" asked Laurie, leaning over"
514	Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave
514	her.
514	""
514	"""No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind, dear."
514	It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been.  Father is as
514	"regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, perhaps."""
514	""
514	A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a
514	letter.
514	""
514	"""It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,"" she said, handling it"
514	as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.
514	""
514	At the word 'telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it
514	contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little
514	paper had sent a bullet to her heart.  Laurie dashed downstairs for
514	water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a
514	frightened voice...
514	""
514	    Mrs. March:
514	    Your husband is very ill.  Come at once.
514	    S.  HALE
514	    Blank Hospital, Washington.
514	""
514	How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the
514	day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to
514	change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the
514	happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.
514	""
514	Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and
514	stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never
514	"forgot, ""I shall go at once, but it may be too late.  Oh, children,"
514	"children, help me to bear it!"""
514	""
514	For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the
514	room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help,
514	and hopeful whispers that died away in tears.  Poor Hannah was the
514	first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a
514	good example, for with her, work was panacea for most afflictions.
514	""
514	"""The Lord keep the dear man!  I won't waste no time a-cryin', but git"
514	"your things ready right away, mum,"" she said heartily, as she wiped her"
514	face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her
514	own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.
514	""
514	"""She's right, there's no time for tears now.  Be calm, girls, and let"
514	"me think."""
514	""
514	They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking
514	pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.
514	""
514	"""Where's Laurie?"" she asked presently, when she had collected her"
514	thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.
514	""
514	"""Here, ma'am.  Oh, let me do something!"" cried the boy, hurrying from"
514	the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow
514	was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.
514	""
514	"""Send a telegram saying I will come at once.  The next train goes early"
514	"in the morning.  I'll take that."""
514	""
514	"""What else?  The horses are ready.  I can go anywhere, do anything,"" he"
514	said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.
514	""
514	"""Leave a note at Aunt March's.  Jo, give me that pen and paper."""
514	""
514	Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew
514	the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad
514	journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to
514	add a little to the sum for her father.
514	""
514	"""Now go, dear, but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate pace."
514	"There is no need of that."""
514	""
514	Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later
514	Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his
514	life.
514	""
514	"""Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come. On the way"
514	get these things.  I'll put them down, they'll be needed and I must go
514	prepared for nursing.  Hospital stores are not always good.  Beth, go
514	and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine.  I'm not too
514	proud to beg for Father.  He shall have the best of everything.  Amy,
514	tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and Meg, come and help me find
514	"my things, for I'm half bewildered."""
514	""
514	Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the
514	poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little
514	while, and let them work.  Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust
514	of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if
514	the paper had been an evil spell.
514	""
514	Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the
514	kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest
514	promises of protection for the girls during the mother's absence, which
514	comforted her very much.  There was nothing he didn't offer, from his
514	own dressing gown to himself as escort.  But the last was impossible.
514	Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman's undertaking the long
514	journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it,
514	for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy
514	eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he'd be
514	back directly.  No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran
514	through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea
514	in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.
514	""
514	"""I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,"" he said, in the kind,"
514	"quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit.  ""I"
514	came to offer myself as escort to your mother.  Mr. Laurence has
514	commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction
514	"to be of service to her there."""
514	""
514	Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg
514	put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. Brooke
514	would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling
514	one of time and comfort which he was about to take.
514	""
514	"""How kind you all are!  Mother will accept, I'm sure, and it will be"
514	such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her.  Thank
514	"you very, very much!"""
514	""
514	Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the
514	brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and
514	lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.
514	""
514	Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from
514	Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what
514	she had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd
514	for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come
514	of it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time.  Mrs.
514	March put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on
514	with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo
514	would have understood if she had been there.
514	""
514	The short afternoon wore away.  All other errands were done, and Meg
514	and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy
514	got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a 'slap
514	and a bang', but still Jo did not come.  They began to get anxious, and
514	Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew what freak Jo might take
514	into her head.  He missed her, however, and she came walking in with a
514	very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun
514	and fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as
514	much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a
514	"little choke in her voice, ""That's my contribution toward making Father"
514	"comfortable and bringing him home!"""
514	""
514	"""My dear, where did you get it?  Twenty-five dollars!  Jo, I hope you"
514	"haven't done anything rash?"""
514	""
514	"""No, it's mine honestly.  I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it.  I earned"
514	"it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what was my own."""
514	""
514	As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for
514	all her abundant hair was cut short.
514	""
514	"""Your hair!  Your beautiful hair!""  ""Oh, Jo, how could you? Your one"
514	"beauty.""  ""My dear girl, there was no need of this.""  ""She doesn't look"
514	"like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!"""
514	""
514	As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo
514	assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle,
514	and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked
514	"it, ""It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth.  It"
514	will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig.  It will
514	do my brains good to have that mop taken off.  My head feels
514	deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a
514	curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.
514	"I'm satisfied, so please take the money and let's have supper."""
514	""
514	"""Tell me all about it, Jo.  I am not quite satisfied, but I can't blame"
514	you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call
514	it, to your love.  But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I'm afraid
514	"you will regret it one of these days,"" said Mrs. March."
514	""
514	"""No, I won't!"" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her"
514	prank was not entirely condemned.
514	""
514	"""What made you do it?"" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of"
514	cutting off her head as her pretty hair.
514	""
514	"""Well, I was wild to do something for Father,"" replied Jo, as they"
514	gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the
514	"midst of trouble.  ""I hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew"
514	Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for a ninepence.
514	Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some
514	clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money,
514	"if I sold the nose off my face to get it."""
514	""
514	"""You needn't feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and got"
514	"the simplest with your own hard earnings,"" said Mrs. March with a look"
514	that warmed Jo's heart.
514	""
514	"""I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went"
514	along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd like to
514	dive into some of the rich stores and help myself.  In a barber's
514	window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail,
514	not so thick as mine, was forty dollars.  It came to me all of a sudden
514	that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to
514	think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give
514	"for mine."""
514	""
514	"""I don't see how you dared to do it,"" said Beth in a tone of awe."
514	""
514	"""Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his"
514	hair.  He rather stared at first, as if he wasn't used to having girls
514	bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair.  He said he didn't
514	care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never paid
514	much for it in the first place.  The work put into it made it dear, and
514	so on.  It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn't done right
514	away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you know when I start to
514	do a thing, I hate to give it up.  So I begged him to take it, and told
514	him why I was in such a hurry.  It was silly, I dare say, but it
514	changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my
514	topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, 'Take it,
514	Thomas, and oblige the young lady.  I'd do as much for our Jimmy any
514	"day if I had a spire of hair worth selling."""
514	""
514	"""Who was Jimmy?"" asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they"
514	went along.
514	""
514	"""Her son, she said, who was in the army.  How friendly such things make"
514	strangers feel, don't they?  She talked away all the time the man
514	"clipped, and diverted my mind nicely."""
514	""
514	"""Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?"" asked Meg, with a"
514	shiver.
514	""
514	"""I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that"
514	was the end of it.  I never snivel over trifles like that. I will
514	confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on
514	the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost
514	seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off.  The woman saw me look at it, and
514	picked out a long lock for me to keep.  I'll give it to you, Marmee,
514	just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don't
514	"think I shall ever have a mane again."""
514	""
514	Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short
514	"gray one in her desk.  She only said, ""Thank you, deary,"" but something"
514	in her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully
514	as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the prospect of a fine day
514	tomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to
514	be nursed.
514	""
514	No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o'clock Mrs. March put by the
514	"last finished job, and said, ""Come girls.""  Beth went to the piano and"
514	played the father's favorite hymn.  All began bravely, but broke down
514	one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to
514	her music was always a sweet consoler.
514	""
514	"""Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early and shall need all"
514	"the sleep we can get.  Good night, my darlings,"" said Mrs. March, as"
514	the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.
514	""
514	They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear
514	invalid lay in the next room.  Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite
514	of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious
514	thoughts she had ever known in her short life.  Jo lay motionless, and
514	her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her
514	exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek...
514	""
514	"""Jo, dear, what is it?  Are you crying about father?"""
514	""
514	"""No, not now."""
514	""
514	"""What then?"""
514	""
514	"""My... My hair!"" burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her"
514	emotion in the pillow.
514	""
514	It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the
514	afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.
514	""
514	"""I'm not sorry,"" protested Jo, with a choke.  ""I'd do it again"
514	tomorrow, if I could.  It's only the vain part of me that goes and
514	cries in this silly way.  Don't tell anyone, it's all over now.  I
514	thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my
514	"one beauty.  How came you to be awake?"""
514	""
514	"""I can't sleep, I'm so anxious,"" said Meg."
514	""
514	"""Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off."""
514	""
514	"""I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever."""
514	""
514	"""What did you think of?"""
514	""
514	"""Handsome faces--eyes particularly,"" answered Meg, smiling to herself"
514	in the dark.
514	""
514	"""What color do you like best?"""
514	""
514	"""Brown, that is, sometimes.  Blue are lovely."""
514	""
514	Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably
514	promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in
514	her castle in the air.
514	""
514	The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a
514	figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here,
514	settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each
514	unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to
514	pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter.  As she lifted the
514	curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from
514	behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face,
514	"which seemed to whisper in the silence, ""Be comforted, dear soul!"
514	"There is always light behind the clouds."""
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER SIXTEEN
514	""
514	LETTERS
514	""
514	In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter
514	with an earnestness never felt before.  For now the shadow of a real
514	trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and
514	as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully,
514	and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or
514	complaints from them.  Everything seemed very strange when they went
514	down, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.
514	Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar
514	face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap
514	on.  The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother's cloak and bonnet
514	lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so
514	pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it
514	very hard to keep their resolution.  Meg's eyes kept filling in spite
514	of herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more
514	than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as
514	if sorrow was a new experience to them.
514	""
514	Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting
514	for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied
514	about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of
514	her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up
514	her travelling bag...
514	""
514	"""Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's protection."
514	Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as
514	if you were his own.  I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that
514	you should take this trouble rightly.  Don't grieve and fret when I am
514	gone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being
514	idle and trying to forget.  Go on with your work as usual, for work is
514	a blessed solace.  Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember
514	"that you never can be fatherless."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, Mother."""
514	""
514	"""Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and in"
514	any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence.  Be patient, Jo, don't get
514	despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl,
514	ready to help and cheer all.  Beth, comfort yourself with your music,
514	and be faithful to the little home duties, and you, Amy, help all you
514	"can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home."""
514	""
514	"""We will, Mother!  We will!"""
514	""
514	The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen.
514	That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well.  No one cried,
514	no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very
514	heavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they
514	spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their
514	mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands
514	cheerfully when she drove away.
514	""
514	Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke
514	looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him
514	'Mr. Greatheart' on the spot.
514	""
514	"""Good-by, my darlings!  God bless and keep us all!"" whispered Mrs."
514	March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried
514	into the carriage.
514	""
514	As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it
514	shining on the group at the gate like a good omen.  They saw it also,
514	and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she beheld as she
514	turned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a
514	bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.
514	""
514	"""How kind everyone is to us!"" she said, turning to find fresh proof of"
514	it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.
514	""
514	"""I don't see how they can help it,"" returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so"
514	infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling. And so the journey
514	began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful words.
514	""
514	"""I feel as if there had been an earthquake,"" said Jo, as their"
514	neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh
514	themselves.
514	""
514	"""It seems as if half the house was gone,"" added Meg forlornly."
514	""
514	Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile
514	of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother's table, showing that even in
514	her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them.  It was a
514	little thing, but it went straight to their hearts, and in spite of
514	their brave resolutions, they all broke down and cried bitterly.
514	""
514	Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when the
514	shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with
514	a coffeepot.
514	""
514	"""Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don't fret."
514	Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's fall to work
514	"and be a credit to the family."""
514	""
514	Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that
514	morning.  No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant
514	invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot.  They drew up to
514	the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten
514	minutes were all right again.
514	""
514	"""'Hope and keep busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see who will"
514	remember it best.  I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won't she
514	"lecture though!"" said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit."
514	""
514	"""I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home and attend"
514	"to things here,"" said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her eyes so red."
514	""
514	"""No need of that.  Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,"" put in"
514	Amy, with an important air.
514	""
514	"""Hannah will tell us what to do, and we'll have everything nice when"
514	"you come home,"" added Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub without"
514	delay.
514	""
514	"""I think anxiety is very interesting,"" observed Amy, eating sugar"
514	pensively.
514	""
514	The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg
514	shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar
514	bowl.
514	""
514	The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two went
514	out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window
514	where they were accustomed to see their mother's face.  It was gone,
514	but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she
514	was, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin.
514	""
514	"""That's so like my Beth!"" said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful"
514	"face.  ""Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't strain today.  Don't"
514	"fret about Father, dear,"" she added, as they parted."
514	""
514	"""And I hope Aunt March won't croak.  Your hair is becoming, and it"
514	"looks very boyish and nice,"" returned Meg, trying not to smile at the"
514	curly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister's shoulders.
514	""
514	"""That's my only comfort."" And, touching her hat a la Laurie, away went"
514	Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.
514	""
514	News from their father comforted the girls very much, for though
514	dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had
514	already done him good.  Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as
514	the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which
514	grew more cheerful as the week passed.  At first, everyone was eager to
514	write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by
514	one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their
514	Washington correspondence.  As one of these packets contained
514	characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and
514	read them.
514	""
514	My dearest Mother:
514	""
514	It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for
514	the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and crying over it.  How
514	very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence's business
514	detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father.
514	The girls are all as good as gold.  Jo helps me with the sewing, and
514	insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs.  I should be afraid she might
514	overdo, if I didn't know her 'moral fit' wouldn't last long.  Beth is
514	as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told
514	her.  She grieves about Father, and looks sober except when she is at
514	her little piano.  Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her.
514	She does her own hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and
514	mend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased
514	with her improvement when you come.  Mr. Laurence watches over us like
514	a motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly.
514	He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel
514	like orphans, with you so far away.  Hannah is a perfect saint.  She
514	does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is
514	quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect.  We are all well
514	and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back.  Give my
514	dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own...
514	""
514	MEG
514	""
514	This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to
514	the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper,
514	ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed
514	letters.
514	""
514	My precious Marmee:
514	""
514	Three cheers for dear Father!  Brooke was a trump to telegraph right
514	off, and let us know the minute he was better.  I rushed up garret when
514	the letter came, and tried to thank god for being so good to us, but I
514	"could only cry, and say, ""I'm glad!  I'm glad!"" Didn't that do as well"
514	as a regular prayer?  For I felt a great many in my heart.  We have
514	such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so
514	desperately good, it's like living in a nest of turtledoves.  You'd
514	laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish.  She gets
514	prettier every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes.  The children
514	are regular archangels, and I--well, I'm Jo, and never shall be
514	anything else.  Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel
514	with Laurie.  I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was
514	offended.  I was right, but didn't speak as I ought, and he marched
514	home, saying he wouldn't come again till I begged pardon.  I declared I
514	wouldn't and got mad. It lasted all day.  I felt bad and wanted you
514	very much.  Laurie and I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon.
514	But I thought he'd come to it, for I was in the right.  He didn't come,
514	and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the
514	river.  I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun
514	set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry.  I met him at
514	the gate, coming for the same thing.  We both laughed, begged each
514	other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.
514	""
514	I made a 'pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash, and as
514	Father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse him.  Give
514	him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen times for
514	your...

514	with Father's tune.  I can't sing 'LAND OF THE LEAL' now, it makes me

514	accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles.  Amy

514	upside down frequent, but he heartens the girls, so I let em hev full

514	""
514	LITTLE FAITHFUL
514	""
514	For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied
514	the neighborhood.  It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a
514	heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion.  Relieved
514	of their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed
514	their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old
514	ways.  They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy
514	seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt
514	that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.
514	""
514	Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough,
514	and was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March
514	didn't like to hear people read with colds in their heads.  Jo liked
514	this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on
514	the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books.  Amy found that
514	housework and art did not go well together, and returned to her mud
514	pies.  Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at
514	home, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or
514	reading the Washington dispatches over and over.  Beth kept on, with
514	only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.
514	""
514	All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her
514	sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a
514	clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting.  When her heart got heavy
514	with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a
514	certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made
514	her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself.
514	Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt
514	how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her for
514	comfort or advice in their small affairs.
514	""
514	All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and
514	when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well and
514	deserved praise.  So they did, but their mistake was in ceasing to do
514	well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.
514	""
514	"""Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels.  You know Mother told us not"
514	"to forget them."" said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's departure."
514	""
514	"""I'm too tired to go this afternoon,"" replied Meg, rocking comfortably"
514	as she sewed.
514	""
514	"""Can't you, Jo?"" asked Beth."
514	""
514	"""Too stormy for me with my cold."""
514	""
514	"""I thought it was almost well."""
514	""
514	"""It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to"
514	"go to the Hummels',"" said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of"
514	her inconsistency.
514	""
514	"""Why don't you go yourself?"" asked Meg."
514	""
514	"""I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't know what to"
514	do for it.  Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of
514	it.  But it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to
514	"go."""
514	""
514	Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.
514	""
514	"""Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air"
514	"will do you good,"" said Jo, adding apologetically, ""I'd go but I want"
514	"to finish my writing."""
514	""
514	"""My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought maybe some of you would go,"""
514	said Beth.
514	""
514	"""Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,"" suggested Meg."
514	""
514	So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and
514	the Hummels were forgotten.  An hour passed.  Amy did not come, Meg
514	went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her story,
514	and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly
514	put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor
514	children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a
514	grieved look in her patient eyes.  It was late when she came back, and
514	no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room.
514	Half an hour after, Jo went to 'Mother's closet' for something, and
514	there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very
514	grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.
514	""
514	"""Christopher Columbus!  What's the matter?"" cried Jo, as Beth put out"
514	her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly. . .
514	""
514	"""You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you?"""
514	""
514	"""Years ago, when Meg did.  Why?"""
514	""
514	"""Then I'll tell you.  Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!"""
514	""
514	"""What baby?"""
514	""
514	"""Mrs. Hummel's.  It died in my lap before she got home,"" cried Beth"
514	with a sob.
514	""
514	"""My poor dear, how dreadful for you!  I ought to have gone,"" said Jo,"
514	taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother's big
514	chair, with a remorseful face.
514	""
514	"""It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad!  I saw in a minute it was sicker,"
514	but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and
514	let Lotty rest.  It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden if gave a little
514	cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet,
514	and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was
514	"dead."""
514	""
514	"""Don't cry, dear!  What did you do?"""
514	""
514	"""I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor."
514	He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have sore
514	throats.  'Scarlet fever, ma'am.  Ought to have called me before,' he
514	said crossly.  Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure
514	baby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to
514	help the others and trust to charity for his pay.  He smiled then, and
514	was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned
514	round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right
514	"away, or I'd have the fever."""
514	""
514	"""No, you won't!"" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look."
514	"""Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What"
514	"shall we do?"""
514	""
514	"""Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly.  I looked in"
514	Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and
514	queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel
514	"better,"" said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and"
514	trying to look well.
514	""
514	"""If Mother was only at home!"" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and"
514	feeling that Washington was an immense way off.  She read a page,
514	looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said
514	"gravely, ""You've been over the baby every day for more than a week, and"
514	among the others who are going to have it, so I'm afraid you are going
514	"to have it, Beth.  I'll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness."""
514	""
514	"""Don't let Amy come.  She never had it, and I should hate to give it to"
514	"her.  Can't you and Meg have it over again?"" asked Beth, anxiously."
514	""
514	"""I guess not.  Don't care if I do.  Serve me right, selfish pig, to let"
514	"you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!"" muttered Jo, as she went to"
514	consult Hannah.
514	""
514	The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once,
514	assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever,
514	and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed, and felt
514	much relieved as they went up to call Meg.
514	""
514	"""Now I'll tell you what we'll do,"" said Hannah, when she had examined"
514	"and questioned Beth, ""we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at"
514	you, dear, and see that we start right.  Then we'll send Amy off to
514	Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you
514	"girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two."""
514	""
514	"""I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest,"" began Meg, looking anxious and"
514	self-reproachful.
514	""
514	"""I shall, because it's my fault she is sick.  I told Mother I'd do the"
514	"errands, and I haven't,"" said Jo decidedly."
514	""
514	"""Which will you have, Beth?  There ain't no need of but one,"" aid"
514	Hannah.
514	""
514	"""Jo, please."" And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a"
514	contented look, which effectually settled that point.
514	""
514	"""I'll go and tell Amy,"" said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather"
514	relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.
514	""
514	Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather
514	have the fever than go to Aunt March.  Meg reasoned, pleaded, and
514	commanded, all in vain.  Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg
514	left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.  Before she came
514	back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head
514	in the sofa cushions.  She told her story, expecting to be consoled,
514	but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room,
514	whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought.  Presently he
514	"sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, ""Now be a"
514	sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what
514	a jolly plan I've got.  You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take
514	you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.
514	"Won't that be better than moping here?"""
514	""
514	"""I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,"" began Amy, in an"
514	injured voice.
514	""
514	"""Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well.  You don't want to be"
514	"sick, do you?"""
514	""
514	"""No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with"
514	"Beth all the time."""
514	""
514	"""That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may"
514	escape it.  Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or
514	if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly.  I
514	advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke,
514	"miss."""
514	""
514	"""But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross,"" said Amy, looking"
514	rather frightened.
514	""
514	"""It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is,"
514	and take you out gallivanting.  The old lady likes me, and I'll be as
514	"sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us, whatever we do."""
514	""
514	"""Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?"""
514	""
514	"""On my honor as a gentleman."""
514	""
514	"""And come every single day?"""
514	""
514	"""See if I don't!"""
514	""
514	"""And bring me back the minute Beth is well?"""
514	""
514	"""The identical minute."""
514	""
514	"""And go to the theater, truly?"""
514	""
514	"""A dozen theaters, if we may."""
514	""
514	"""Well--I guess I will,"" said Amy slowly."
514	""
514	"""Good girl!  Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in,"" said Laurie, with"
514	an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the 'giving in'.
514	""
514	Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been
514	wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised
514	to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.
514	""
514	"""How is the little dear?"" asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet,"
514	and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.
514	""
514	"""She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better.  The baby's death"
514	troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she
514	"thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety,"" answered"
514	Meg.
514	""
514	"""What a trying world it is!"" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful"
514	"way.  ""No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another."
514	There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother's gone, so
514	"I'm all at sea."""
514	""
514	"""Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle"
514	your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do
514	"anything?"" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of"
514	his friend's one beauty.
514	""
514	"""That is what troubles me,"" said Meg.  ""I think we ought to tell her if"
514	Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for Mother can't leave
514	Father, and it will only make them anxious.  Beth won't be sick long,
514	and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her,
514	"so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me."""
514	""
514	"""Hum, well, I can't say.  Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor"
514	"has been."""
514	""
514	"""We will.  Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,"" commanded Meg. ""We can't"
514	"decide anything till he has been."""
514	""
514	"""Stay where you are, Jo.  I'm errand boy to this establishment,"" said"
514	Laurie, taking up his cap.
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid you are busy,"" began Meg."
514	""
514	"""No, I've done my lessons for the day."""
514	""
514	"""Do you study in vacation time?"" asked Jo."
514	""
514	"""I follow the good example my neighbors set me,"" was Laurie's answer,"
514	as he swung himself out of the room.
514	""
514	"""I have great hopes for my boy,"" observed Jo, watching him fly over the"
514	fence with an approving smile.
514	""
514	"""He does very well, for a boy,"" was Meg's somewhat ungracious answer,"
514	for the subject did not interest her.
514	""
514	Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she
514	would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.
514	Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off
514	danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.
514	""
514	Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.
514	""
514	"""What do you want now?"" she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles,"
514	while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out...
514	""
514	"""Go away.  No boys allowed here."""
514	""
514	Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.
514	""
514	"""No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among"
514	poor folks.  Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn't sick,
514	which I've no doubt she will be, looks like it now.  Don't cry, child,
514	"it worries me to hear people sniff."""
514	""
514	Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's
514	tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out,
514	"""Bless my boots!"" in such a funny way, that she laughed instead."
514	""
514	"""What do you hear from your mother?"" asked the old lady gruffly."
514	""
514	"""Father is much better,"" replied Jo, trying to keep sober."
514	""
514	"""Oh, is he?  Well, that won't last long, I fancy.  March never had any"
514	"stamina,"" was the cheerful reply."
514	""
514	"""Ha, ha!  Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!"""
514	squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap
514	as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.
514	""
514	"""Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!  And, Jo, you'd better"
514	go at once.  It isn't proper to be gadding about so late with a
514	"rattlepated boy like..."""
514	""
514	"""Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!"" cried Polly, tumbling"
514	off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the 'rattlepated' boy,
514	who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.
514	""
514	"""I don't think I can bear it, but I'll try,"" thought Amy, as she was"
514	left alone with Aunt March.
514	""
514	"""Get along, you fright!"" screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy"
514	could not restrain a sniff.

514	CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
514	""
514	DARK DAYS
514	""
514	Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and
514	the doctor suspected.  The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.
514	Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own
514	way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the
514	excellent nurse.  Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings,
514	and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote
514	letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness.  She could not
514	think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind
514	Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of 'Mrs. March bein' told, and worried
514	just for sech a trifle.'
514	""
514	Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was
514	very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could
514	control herself.  But there came a time when during the fever fits she
514	began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if
514	on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen
514	that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar
514	faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called
514	imploringly for her mother.  Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be
514	allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she 'would think of
514	it, though there was no danger yet'.  A letter from Washington added to
514	their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of
514	coming home for a long while.
514	""
514	How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how
514	heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while
514	the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that
514	Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how
514	rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could
514	buy--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of
514	life.  Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that
514	suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice
514	sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of
514	Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all
514	hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to
514	live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple
514	virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more
514	than talent, wealth, or beauty.  And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly
514	to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no
514	service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful
514	grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her.
514	Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked
514	the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young
514	neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him.  Everyone
514	missed Beth.  The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she
514	did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to
514	get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and
514	good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find
514	how many friends shy little Beth had made.
514	""
514	Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in
514	her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.  She longed for
514	her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick,
514	and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo.  She sent
514	loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write
514	soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that
514	Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these
514	intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing
514	to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy
514	sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,
514	Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to
514	send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.
514	""
514	The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter
514	wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its
514	death.  When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held
514	the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down,
514	"saying, in a low voice to Hannah, ""If Mrs. March can leave her husband"
514	"she'd better be sent for."""
514	""
514	Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg
514	dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs
514	at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a
514	minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on
514	her things, rushed out into the storm.  She was soon back, and while
514	noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying
514	that Mr. March was mending again.  Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy
514	weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of
514	"misery that Laurie asked quickly, ""What is it?  Is Beth worse?"""
514	""
514	"""I've sent for Mother,"" said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a"
514	tragic expression.
514	""
514	"""Good for you, Jo!  Did you do it on your own responsibility?"" asked"
514	Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious
514	boots, seeing how her hands shook.
514	""
514	"""No.  The doctor told us to."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that?"" cried Laurie, with a startled face."
514	""
514	"""Yes, it is.  She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the"
514	flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. She
514	doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it.
514	Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find
514	"Him."""
514	""
514	As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her
514	hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie
514	took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his
514	"throat, ""I'm here.  Hold on to me, Jo, dear!"""
514	""
514	She could not speak, but she did 'hold on', and the warm grasp of the
514	friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her
514	nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.
514	""
514	Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting
514	words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as
514	her mother used to do.  It was the best thing he could have done, far
514	more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken
514	sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection
514	administers to sorrow.  Soon she dried the tears which had relieved
514	her, and looked up with a grateful face.
514	""
514	"""Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now.  I don't feel so forlorn, and will"
514	"try to bear it if it comes."""
514	""
514	"""Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo.  Soon your mother"
514	"will be here, and then everything will be all right."""
514	""
514	"""I'm so glad Father is better.  Now she won't feel so bad about leaving"
514	him.  Oh, me!  It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and
514	"I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,"" sighed Jo, spreading her wet"
514	handkerchief over her knees to dry.
514	""
514	"""Doesn't Meg pull fair?"" asked Laurie, looking indignant."
514	""
514	"""Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do, and she won't"
514	miss her as I shall.  Beth is my conscience, and I can't give her up.
514	"I can't!  I can't!"""
514	""
514	Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried
514	despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a
514	tear.  Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till
514	he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips.
514	It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it.
514	"Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, ""I don't think she"
514	will die.  She's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe
514	"God will take her away yet."""
514	""
514	"""The good and dear people always do die,"" groaned Jo, but she stopped"
514	crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in spite of her own
514	doubts and fears.
514	""
514	"""Poor girl, you're worn out.  It isn't like you to be forlorn. Stop a"
514	"bit.  I'll hearten you up in a jiffy."""
514	""
514	Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down
514	on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from
514	the table where she left it.  It must have possessed some magic, for
514	the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and
514	when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a
514	"smile, and said bravely, ""I drink-- Health to my Beth!  You are a good"
514	"doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend.  How can I ever pay you?"""
514	she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done
514	her troubled mind.
514	""
514	"""I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you something that"
514	"will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,"" said"
514	Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at
514	something.
514	""
514	"""What is it?"" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder."
514	""
514	"""I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she'd come"
514	at once, and she'll be here tonight, and everything will be all right.
514	"Aren't you glad I did it?"""
514	""
514	Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for
514	he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or
514	harming Beth.  Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the
514	moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms
514	"round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, ""Oh, Laurie!  Oh,"
514	"Mother!  I am so glad!""  She did not weep again, but laughed"
514	hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a
514	little bewildered by the sudden news.
514	""
514	Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind.
514	He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering,
514	followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at
514	once.  Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying
514	"breathlessly, ""Oh, don't!  I didn't mean to, it was dreadful of me, but"
514	you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't
514	help flying at you.  Tell me all about it, and don't give me wine
514	"again, it makes me act so."""
514	""
514	"""I don't mind,"" laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie.  ""Why, you see I"
514	got fidgety, and so did Grandpa.  We thought Hannah was overdoing the
514	authority business, and your mother ought to know. She'd never forgive
514	us if Beth...  Well, if anything happened, you know.  So I got grandpa
514	to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the
514	office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my
514	head off when I proposed a telegram.  I never can bear to be 'lorded
514	over', so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I
514	know, and the late train is in at two A.M. I shall go for her, and
514	you've only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till
514	"that blessed lady gets here."""
514	""
514	"""Laurie, you're an angel!  How shall I ever thank you?"""
514	""
514	"""Fly at me again.  I rather liked it,"" said Laurie, looking"
514	mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.
514	""
514	"""No, thank you.  I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don't"
514	tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night. Bless
514	"you, Teddy, bless you!"""
514	""
514	Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech, she
514	vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a
514	"dresser and told the assembled cats that she was ""happy, oh, so happy!"""
514	while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of
514	it.
514	""
514	"""That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do"
514	"hope Mrs. March is coming right away,"" said Hannah, with an air of"
514	relief, when Jo told the good news.
514	""
514	Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set
514	"the sickroom in order, and Hannah ""knocked up a couple of pies in case"
514	"of company unexpected"".  A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through"
514	the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet
514	rooms.  Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change.  Beth's bird
514	began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's
514	bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness,
514	and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as
514	"they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, ""Mother's coming,"
514	"dear! Mother's coming!""  Every one rejoiced but Beth.  She lay in that"
514	heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It
514	was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once
514	busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and
514	the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the
514	pillow.  All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter,
514	"""Water!"" with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word.  All"
514	day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and
514	trusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind
514	raged, and the hours dragged slowly by.  But night came at last, and
514	every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side
514	of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour
514	brought help nearer.  The doctor had been in to say that some change,
514	for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which
514	time he would return.
514	""
514	Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot and fell
514	fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling
514	that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's countenance
514	as she entered.  Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring
514	into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes
514	beautifully soft and clear.
514	""
514	The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they
514	kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes
514	to us in hours like those.
514	""
514	"""If God spares Beth, I never will complain again,"" whispered Meg"
514	earnestly.
514	""
514	"""If god spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him all my life,"""
514	answered Jo, with equal fervor.
514	""
514	"""I wish I had no heart, it aches so,"" sighed Meg, after a pause."
514	""
514	"""If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shall get"
514	"through it,"" added her sister despondently."
514	""
514	Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching
514	Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was
514	still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep
514	hush.  Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale
514	shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed.  An hour went by, and
514	nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station.
514	Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the
514	storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at
514	Washington, haunted the girls.
514	""
514	It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary
514	the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the
514	bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's easy
514	chair with her face hidden.  A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as
514	"she thought, ""Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me."""
514	""
514	She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great
514	change seemed to have taken place.  The fever flush and the look of
514	pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful
514	in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament.
514	Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp
514	"forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, ""Good-by, my"
514	"Beth.  Good-by!"""
514	""
514	As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to
514	the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and
514	then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro,
514	"exclaiming, under her breath, ""The fever's turned, she's sleepin'"
514	nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes easy.  Praise be given!  Oh,
514	"my goodness me!"""
514	""
514	Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to
514	confirm it.  He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite
514	"heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, ""Yes,"
514	my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time.  Keep
514	"the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her..."""
514	""
514	What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark
514	hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with
514	hearts too full for words.  When they went back to be kissed and
514	cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do,
514	with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and
514	breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.
514	""
514	"""If Mother would only come now!"" said Jo, as the winter night began to"
514	wane.
514	""
514	"""See,"" said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, ""I thought"
514	this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand tomorrow if she--went
514	away from us.  But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put
514	it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she
514	"sees will be the little rose, and Mother's face."""
514	""
514	Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed
514	so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out
514	in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.
514	""
514	"""It looks like a fairy world,"" said Meg, smiling to herself, as she"
514	stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.
514	""
514	"""Hark!"" cried Jo, starting to her feet."
514	""
514	Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah,
514	"and then Laurie's voice saying in a joyful whisper, ""Girls, she's come!"
514	"She's come!"""
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER NINETEEN
514	""
514	AMY'S WILL
514	""
514	While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at
514	Aunt March's.  She felt her exile deeply, and for the first time in her
514	life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home.  Aunt March
514	never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be
514	kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt
514	March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children,
514	though she didn't think it proper to confess it.  She really did her
514	best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made. Some old
514	people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can
514	sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at
514	home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and
514	receiving friendship in the sweetest way.  But Aunt March had not this
514	gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim
514	ways, and long, prosy talks.  Finding the child more docile and amiable
514	than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract,
514	as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.  So
514	she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught
514	sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made
514	her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.
514	""
514	She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned
514	spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone.  Then
514	she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was.  Not a speck
514	escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much
514	carving, which was never dusted to suit.  Then Polly had to be fed, the
514	lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or
514	deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big
514	chair.  After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was
514	a daily trial of every virtue she possessed.  Then she was allowed one
514	hour for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it?
514	""
514	Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to
514	go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times.
514	After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady
514	slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the
514	first page.  Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with
514	outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed
514	to amuse herself as she liked till teatime.  The evenings were the
514	worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her
514	youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go
514	to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep
514	before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.
514	""
514	If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that
514	she never could have got through that dreadful time.  The parrot alone
514	was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not
514	admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible.
514	He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk
514	to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by
514	pecking at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and
514	behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird.  Then she could
514	not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her
514	when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in
514	the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted
514	something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day.  The cook was
514	bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who
514	ever took any notice of the young lady.
514	""
514	Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with 'Madame', as she called her
514	mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,
514	who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but
514	Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that
514	she was never asked to change her religion.  She took a fancy to
514	Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in
514	France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces.  She
514	also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious
514	and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient
514	chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie.  Amy's chief delight was
514	an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and
514	secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some
514	precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and
514	arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel
514	cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had
514	adorned a belle forty years ago.  There was the garnet set which Aunt
514	March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her
514	wedding day, her lover's diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the
514	queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made
514	of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn,
514	Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had
514	played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring,
514	too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most
514	precious jewel of them all.
514	""
514	"""Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?"" asked Esther,"
514	who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.
514	""
514	"""I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm"
514	fond of necklaces, they are so becoming.  I should choose this if I
514	"might,"" replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold"
514	and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.
514	""
514	"""I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.  Ah, no!  To me it is a"
514	"rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic,"" said Esther,"
514	eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.
514	""
514	"""Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads"
514	"hanging over your glass?"" asked Amy."
514	""
514	"""Truly, yes, to pray with.  It would be pleasing to the saints if one"
514	"used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou."""
514	""
514	"""You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and"
514	"always come down looking quiet and satisfied.  I wish I could."""
514	""
514	"""If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort, but as"
514	that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to
514	meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before
514	Madame.  She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much
514	"trouble."""
514	""
514	"""Would it be right for me to do so too?"" asked Amy, who in her"
514	loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was
514	apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind
514	her of it.
514	""
514	"""It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the"
514	little dressing room for you if you like it.  Say nothing to Madame,
514	but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good
514	"thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister."""
514	""
514	Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an
514	affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety.
514	Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next
514	her room, hoping it would do her good.
514	""
514	"""I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March"
514	"dies,"" she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the"
514	jewel cases one by one.
514	""
514	"""To you and your sisters.  I know it, Madame confides in me. I"
514	"witnessed her will, and it is to be so,"" whispered Esther smiling."
514	""
514	""
514	"""How nice!  But I wish she'd let us have them now. Procrastination is"
514	"not agreeable,"" observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds."
514	""
514	"""It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The"
514	first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said it,
514	and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you
514	when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming
514	"manners."""
514	""
514	"""Do you think so?  Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely"
514	ring!  It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's.  I do like Aunt
514	"March after all."" And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face"
514	and a firm resolve to earn it.
514	""
514	From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady
514	complacently admired the success of her training.  Esther fitted up the
514	closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a
514	picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms.  She thought it was of no
514	great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that
514	Madame would never know it, nor care if she did.  It was, however, a
514	very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and
514	Amy's beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet
514	face of the Divine Mother, while her tender thoughts of her own were
514	busy at her heart.  On the table she laid her little testament and
514	hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought
514	her, and came every day to 'sit alone' thinking good thoughts, and
514	praying the dear God to preserve her sister.  Esther had given her a
514	rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did
514	not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.
514	""
514	The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone
514	outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold
514	by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender
514	Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children.
514	She missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having
514	been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in
514	it confidingly.  But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden
514	seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and
514	be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it.
514	In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her
514	will, as Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her
514	possessions might be justly and generously divided.  It cost her a pang
514	even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were
514	as precious as the old lady's jewels.
514	""
514	During one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as
514	well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal
514	terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy
514	felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a
514	second witness.  As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse
514	herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for
514	company.  In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned
514	costumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite
514	amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and
514	down before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her
514	train about with a rustle which delighted her ears.  So busy was she on
514	this day that she did not hear Laurie's ring nor see his face peeping
514	in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and
514	tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting
514	oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat.  She
514	was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as
514	Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along
514	in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her,
514	imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh
514	"or exclaim, ""Ain't we fine? Get along, you fright!  Hold your tongue!"
514	"Kiss me, dear!  Ha! Ha!"""
514	""
514	Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it
514	should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously received.
514	""
514	"""Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to"
514	"consult you about a very serious matter,"" said Amy, when she had shown"
514	"her splendor and driven Polly into a corner.  ""That bird is the trial"
514	"of my life,"" she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head,"
514	while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.
514	""
514	"""Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a"
514	mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I went to
514	let him out, and found a big spider there.  I poked it out, and it ran
514	under the bookcase.  Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and
514	peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his
514	eye, 'Come out and take a walk, my dear.' I couldn't help laughing,
514	"which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both."""
514	""
514	"""Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?"" asked Laurie,"
514	yawning.
514	""
514	"""Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and"
514	scrambled up on Aunt's chair, calling out, 'Catch her! Catch her! Catch
514	"her!' as I chased the spider."""
514	""
514	"""That's a lie!  Oh, lor!"" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes."
514	""
514	"""I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,"" cried Laurie,"
514	shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely
514	"croaked, ""Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!"""
514	""
514	"""Now I'm ready,"" said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of"
514	"paper out of her pocket.  ""I want you to read that, please, and tell me"
514	if it is legal and right.  I felt I ought to do it, for life is
514	"uncertain and I don't want any ill feeling over my tomb."""
514	""
514	Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker,
514	read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the
514	spelling:
514	""
514	MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT
514	""
514	I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all
514	my earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely
514	""
514	To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art,
514	including frames.  Also my $100, to do what he likes with.
514	""
514	To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets--also
514	my likeness, and my medal, with much love.
514	""
514	To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it),
514	also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for
514	her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her 'little girl'.
514	""
514	To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my
514	bronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most precious plaster
514	rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.
514	""
514	To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau,
514	my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being
514	thin when she gets well.  And I herewith also leave her my regret that
514	I ever made fun of old Joanna.
514	""
514	To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay
514	portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn't any
514	neck.  Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction
514	any one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.
514	""
514	To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a
514	looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind
514	him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family,
514	especially Beth.
514	""
514	I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron
514	and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.
514	""
514	To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork I leave
514	hoping she 'will remember me, when it you see'.
514	""
514	And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be
514	satisfied and not blame the dead.  I forgive everyone, and trust we may
514	all meet when the trump shall sound.  Amen.
514	""
514	To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of
514	Nov.  Anni Domino 1861.
514	""
514	Amy Curtis March
514	""
514	Witnesses:
514	""
514	Estelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.
514	""
514	""
514	The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to
514	rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.
514	""
514	"""What put it into your head?  Did anyone tell you about Beth's giving"
514	"away her things?"" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape,"
514	with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.
514	""
514	"She explained and then asked anxiously, ""What about Beth?"""
514	""
514	"""I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you.  She felt so ill one"
514	day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to
514	you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake.  She
514	was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest
514	"of us, and her best love to Grandpa.  She never thought of a will."""
514	""
514	Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a
514	great tear dropped on the paper.  Amy's face was full of trouble, but
514	"she only said, ""Don't people put sort of postscripts to their wills,"
514	"sometimes?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, 'codicils', they call them."""
514	""
514	"""Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and given"
514	round to my friends.  I forgot it, but I want it done though it will
514	"spoil my looks."""
514	""
514	Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he
514	amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials.  But
514	when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips,
514	"""Is there really any danger about Beth?"""
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don't cry,"
514	"dear.""  And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which"
514	was very comforting.
514	""
514	When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the
514	twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,
514	feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the
514	loss of her gentle little sister.
514	""

514	CHAPTER TWENTY
514	""
514	CONFIDENTIAL
514	""
514	I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the
514	mother and daughters.  Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard
514	to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers,
514	merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that
514	Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long,
514	healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little
514	rose and Mother's face.  Too weak to wonder at anything, she only
514	smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the
514	hungry longing was satisfied at last.  Then she slept again, and the
514	girls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand
514	which clung to hers even in sleep.
514	""
514	Hannah had 'dished up' an astonishing breakfast for the traveler,
514	finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way, and Meg
514	and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened
514	to her whispered account of Father's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to
514	stay and nurse him, the delays which the storm occasioned on the
514	homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie's hopeful face had
514	given her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.
514	""
514	What a strange yet pleasant day that was.  So brilliant and gay
514	without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow.  So
514	quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching,
514	and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah
514	mounted guard at the door.  With a blissful sense of burdens lifted
514	off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like
514	storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor.  Mrs. March would
514	not leave Beth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to
514	look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some
514	recovered treasure.
514	""
514	Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well
514	"that Aunt March actually 'sniffed' herself, and never once said ""I told"
514	"you so"".  Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good"
514	thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit.  She dried
514	her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and
514	never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily
514	agreed in Laurie's opinion, that she behaved 'like a capital little
514	woman'.  Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl,
514	"blessed her buttons, and begged her to ""come and take a walk, dear"", in"
514	his most affable tone.  She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy
514	the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping
514	with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she
514	persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her
514	mother.  She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was
514	stretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt
514	March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual
514	fit of benignity.
514	""
514	After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till
514	night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually
514	roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were
514	a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it
514	is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in
514	her mother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and
514	compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses.  They
514	were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object
514	when its purpose was explained to her.
514	""
514	"""On the contrary, I like it very much, dear,"" looking from the dusty"
514	rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its
514	"garland of evergreen.  ""It is an excellent plan to have some place"
514	where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us.  There are a
514	good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them
514	if we ask help in the right way.  I think my little girl is learning
514	"this."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big"
514	closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I've tried to
514	make.  The woman's face is not good, it's too beautiful for me to draw,
514	but the baby is done better, and I love it very much.  I like to think
514	He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and that
514	"helps me."""
514	""
514	As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's knee, Mrs.
514	March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile.  She said
514	nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute's pause, she
514	"added gravely, ""I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it."
514	Aunt gave me the ring today.  She called me to her and kissed me, and
514	put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to
514	keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as
514	"it's too big.  I'd like to wear them Mother, can I?"""
514	""
514	"""They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such"
514	"ornaments, Amy,"" said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand,"
514	with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint
514	guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.
514	""
514	"""I'll try not to be vain,"" said Amy.  ""I don't think I like it only"
514	because it's so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story
514	"wore her bracelet, to remind me of something."""
514	""
514	"""Do you mean Aunt March?"" asked her mother, laughing."
514	""
514	"""No, to remind me not to be selfish.""  Amy looked so earnest and"
514	sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened
514	respectfully to the little plan.
514	""
514	"""I've thought a great deal lately about my 'bundle of naughties', and"
514	being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm going to try hard to
514	cure it, if I can.  Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason everyone
514	loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her.  People
514	wouldn't feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to
514	have them, but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends,
514	so I'm going to try and be like Beth all I can.  I'm apt to forget my
514	resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I
514	"guess I should do better.  May we try this way?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your"
514	ring, dear, and do your best.  I think you will prosper, for the
514	sincere wish to be good is half the battle.  Now I must go back to
514	Beth.  Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you
514	"home again."""
514	""
514	That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the
514	traveler's safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth's room, and
514	finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her
514	fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.
514	""
514	"""What is it, deary?"" asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a"
514	face which invited confidence.
514	""
514	"""I want to tell you something, Mother."""
514	""
514	"""About Meg?"""
514	""
514	"""How quickly you guessed!  Yes, it's about her, and though it's a"
514	"little thing, it fidgets me."""
514	""
514	"""Beth is asleep.  Speak low, and tell me all about it.  That Moffat"
514	"hasn't been here, I hope?"" asked Mrs. March rather sharply."
514	""
514	"""No.  I should have shut the door in his face if he had,"" said Jo,"
514	"settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet.  ""Last summer Meg"
514	left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences' and only one was returned.
514	We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke owned that he
514	liked Meg but didn't dare say so, she was so young and he so poor.
514	"Now, isn't it a dreadful state of things?"""
514	""
514	"""Do you think Meg cares for him?"" asked Mrs. March, with an anxious"
514	look.
514	""
514	"""Mercy me!  I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!"" cried"
514	"Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. ""In novels, the"
514	girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin,
514	and acting like fools.  Now Meg does not do anything of the sort.  She
514	eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight
514	in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit
514	when Teddy jokes about lovers.  I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't
514	"mind me as he ought."""
514	""
514	"""Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?"""
514	""
514	"""Who?"" cried Jo, staring."
514	""
514	"""Mr. Brooke.  I call him 'John' now.  We fell into the way of doing so"
514	"at the hospital, and he likes it."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear!  I know you'll take his part.  He's been good to Father, and"
514	you won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to.  Mean
514	thing!  To go petting Papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into
514	"liking him."" And Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak."
514	""
514	"""My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it"
514	happened.  John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so
514	devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond of him.  He
514	was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved
514	her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry
514	him.  He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the
514	right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young
514	man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but I will not consent
514	"to Meg's engaging herself so young."""
514	""
514	"""Of course not.  It would be idiotic!  I knew there was mischief"
514	brewing.  I felt it, and now it's worse than I imagined. I just wish I
514	"could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family."""
514	""
514	"This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said gravely, ""Jo,"
514	I confide in you and don't wish you to say anything to Meg yet.  When
514	John comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her
514	"feelings toward him."""
514	""
514	"""She'll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then it will"
514	be all up with her.  She's got such a soft heart, it will melt like
514	butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her.  She read the
514	short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me
514	when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an
514	ugly name, and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace
514	and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all!  They'll go lovering
514	around the house, and we shall have to dodge.  Meg will be absorbed and
514	no good to me any more. Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry
514	her off, and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and
514	everything will be abominably uncomfortable.  Oh, dear me!  Why weren't
514	"we all boys, then there wouldn't be any bother."""
514	""
514	Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook
514	her fist at the reprehensible John.  Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked
514	up with an air of relief.
514	""
514	"""You don't like it, Mother?  I'm glad of it.  Let's send him about his"
514	business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as
514	"we always have been."""
514	""
514	"""I did wrong to sigh, Jo.  It is natural and right you should all go to"
514	homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls as long as I
514	can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only
514	seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for
514	her.  Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in
514	any way, nor be married, before twenty.  If she and John love one
514	another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so.  She is
514	conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly.  My
514	"pretty, tender hearted girl!  I hope things will go happily with her."""
514	""
514	"""Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man?"" asked Jo, as her"
514	mother's voice faltered a little over the last words.
514	""
514	"""Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never"
514	feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much.  I should
514	like to know that John was firmly established in some good business,
514	which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make
514	Meg comfortable.  I'm not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a
514	fashionable position, or a great name for my girls.  If rank and money
514	come with love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and
514	enjoy your good fortune, but I know, by experience, how much genuine
514	happiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is
514	earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures.  I am
514	content to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be
514	rich in the possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a
514	"fortune."""
514	""
514	"""I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I'm disappointed about Meg,"
514	for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of
514	"luxury all her days.  Wouldn't it be nice?"" asked Jo, looking up with a"
514	brighter face.
514	""
514	"""He is younger than she, you know,"" began Mrs. March, but Jo broke in..."
514	""
514	"""Only a little, he's old for his age, and tall, and can be quite"
514	grown-up in his manners if he likes.  Then he's rich and generous and
514	"good, and loves us all, and I say it's a pity my plan is spoiled."""
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and altogether"
514	too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on.  Don't make
514	plans, Jo, but let time and their own hearts mate your friends.  We
514	can't meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get 'romantic
514	"rubbish' as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship."""
514	""
514	"""Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and"
514	getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten
514	it out.  I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from
514	"growing up.  But buds will be roses, and kittens cats, more's the pity!"""
514	""
514	"""What's that about flatirons and cats?"" asked Meg, as she crept into"
514	the room with the finished letter in her hand.
514	""
514	"""Only one of my stupid speeches.  I'm going to bed.  Come, Peggy,"" said"
514	Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.
514	""
514	"""Quite right, and beautifully written.  Please add that I send my love"
514	"to John,"" said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter and gave it"
514	back.
514	""
514	"""Do you call him 'John'?"" asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes"
514	looking down into her mother's.
514	""
514	"""Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,"""
514	replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.
514	""
514	"""I'm glad of that, he is so lonely.  Good night, Mother, dear.  It is"
514	"so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here,"" was Meg's answer."
514	""
514	The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she went
514	"away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, ""She"
514	"does not love John yet, but will soon learn to."""
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
514	""
514	LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE
514	""
514	Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her,
514	and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important.  Meg
514	observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had
514	learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so
514	she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask.  She was
514	rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo
514	assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn
514	assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother.
514	This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as
514	nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long
514	confinement.  Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as
514	she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was
514	an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.
514	""
514	She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a
514	mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of
514	it.  He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected
514	indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he
514	knew, then that he didn't care; and at last, by dint of perseverance,
514	he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke.  Feeling
514	indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his
514	wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.
514	""
514	Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in
514	preparations for her father's return, but all of a sudden a change
514	seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike
514	herself.  She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very
514	quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her
514	face.  To her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well,
514	and Jo's she silenced by begging to be let alone.
514	""
514	"""She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she's going very fast."
514	She's got most of the symptoms--is twittery and cross, doesn't eat,
514	lies awake, and mopes in corners.  I caught her singing that song he
514	gave her, and once she said 'John', as you do, and then turned as red
514	"as a poppy.  Whatever shall we do?"" said Jo, looking ready for any"
514	measures, however violent.
514	""
514	"""Nothing but wait.  Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father's"
514	"coming will settle everything,"" replied her mother."
514	""
514	"""Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up.  How odd! Teddy never seals"
514	"mine,"" said Jo next day, as she distributed the contents of the little"
514	post office.
514	""
514	Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg
514	made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.
514	""
514	"""My child, what is it?"" cried her mother, running to her, while Jo"
514	tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.
514	""
514	"""It's all a mistake, he didn't send it.  Oh, Jo, how could you do it?"""
514	and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite
514	broken.
514	""
514	"""Me!  I've done nothing!  What's she talking about?"" cried Jo,"
514	bewildered.
514	""
514	Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from
514	"her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, ""You wrote it, and"
514	that bad boy helped you.  How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel
514	"to us both?"""
514	""
514	Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note,
514	which was written in a peculiar hand.
514	""
514	""
514	"""My Dearest Margaret,"
514	""
514	"""I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate before I"
514	return.  I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think they would
514	consent if they knew that we adored one another.  Mr. Laurence will
514	help me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me
514	happy.  I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, but to send
514	one word of hope through Laurie to,
514	""
514	"""Your devoted John."""
514	""
514	""
514	"""Oh, the little villain!  That's the way he meant to pay me for keeping"
514	my word to Mother.  I'll give him a hearty scolding and bring him over
514	"to beg pardon,"" cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice.  But"
514	her mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore...
514	""
514	"""Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first.  You have played so many"
514	"pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this."""
514	""
514	"""On my word, Mother, I haven't!  I never saw that note before, and"
514	"don't know anything about it, as true as I live!"" said Jo, so earnestly"
514	"that they believed her.  ""If I had taken part in it I'd have done it"
514	better than this, and have written a sensible note.  I should think
514	"you'd have known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff as that,"" she"
514	added, scornfully tossing down the paper.
514	""
514	"""It's like his writing,"" faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in"
514	her hand.
514	""
514	"""Oh, Meg, you didn't answer it?"" cried Mrs. March quickly."
514	""
514	"""Yes, I did!"" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame."
514	""
514	"""Here's a scrape!  Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and"
514	"be lectured.  I can't rest till I get hold of him."" And Jo made for the"
514	door again.
514	""
514	"""Hush!  Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret,"
514	"tell me the whole story,"" commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg,"
514	yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.
514	""
514	"""I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew"
514	"anything about it,"" began Meg, without looking up. ""I was worried at"
514	first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr.
514	Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a
514	few days.  I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I
514	was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such
514	things to do.  Forgive me, Mother, I'm paid for my silliness now.  I
514	"never can look him in the face again."""
514	""
514	"""What did you say to him?"" asked Mrs. March."
514	""
514	"""I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn't"
514	wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father.  I was very
514	grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more,
514	"for a long while."""
514	""
514	Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands,
514	"exclaiming, with a laugh, ""You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who"
514	"was a pattern of prudence!  Tell on, Meg. What did he say to that?"""
514	""
514	"""He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent"
514	any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,
514	should take liberties with our names.  It's very kind and respectful,
514	"but think how dreadful for me!"""
514	""
514	Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo
514	tramped about the room, calling Laurie names.  All of a sudden she
514	stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely,
514	"said decidedly, ""I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these"
514	letters.  Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with
514	"because I wouldn't tell him my secret."""
514	""
514	"""Don't have any secrets, Jo.  Tell it to Mother and keep out of"
514	"trouble, as I should have done,"" said Meg warningly."
514	""
514	"""Bless you, child!  Mother told me."""
514	""
514	"""That will do, Jo.  I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie.  I"
514	shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at
514	"once."""
514	""
514	Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real feelings.
514	"""Now, dear, what are your own?  Do you love him enough to wait till he"
514	can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the
514	"present?"""
514	""
514	"""I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do"
514	"with lovers for a long while, perhaps never,"" answered Meg petulantly."
514	"""If John doesn't know anything about this nonsense, don't tell him, and"
514	make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues.  I won't be deceived and plagued
514	"and made a fool of. It's a shame!"""
514	""
514	Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by
514	this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire
514	silence and great discretion for the future.  The instant Laurie's step
514	was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received
514	the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he
514	wouldn't come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and
514	stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.
514	Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a
514	sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.  The sound of
514	voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened
514	during that interview the girls never knew.
514	""
514	When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such
514	a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it
514	wise to betray the fact.  Meg received his humble apology, and was much
514	comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.
514	""
514	"""I'll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan't drag it out of"
514	me, so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show how
514	"out-and-out sorry I am,"" he added, looking very much ashamed of himself."
514	""
514	"""I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn't think"
514	"you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,"" replied Meg, trying to hide"
514	her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.
514	""
514	"""It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for"
514	"a month, but you will, though, won't you?"" And Laurie folded his hands"
514	together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his
514	irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him
514	in spite of his scandalous behavior.
514	""
514	Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite of her
514	efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone
514	for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm
514	before the injured damsel.
514	""
514	Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and
514	succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire
514	disapprobation.  Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed
514	no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till
514	the others were done with him, when he made her a low bow and walked
514	off without a word.
514	""
514	As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and
514	when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and longed for
514	Teddy.  After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and
514	armed with a book to return, went over to the big house.
514	""
514	"""Is Mr. Laurence in?"" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming"
514	downstairs.
514	""
514	"""Yes, Miss, but I don't believe he's seeable just yet."""
514	""
514	"""Why not?  Is he ill?"""
514	""
514	"""La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of"
514	his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I
514	"dursn't go nigh him."""
514	""
514	"""Where is Laurie?"""
514	""
514	"""Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been a-tapping."
514	I don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's ready, and
514	"there's no one to eat it."""
514	""
514	"""I'll go and see what the matter is.  I'm not afraid of either of them."""
514	""
514	Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.
514	""
514	"""Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!"" called out the young"
514	gentleman in a threatening tone.
514	""
514	Jo immediately knocked again.  The door flew open, and in she bounced
514	before Laurie could recover from his surprise.  Seeing that he really
514	was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite
514	expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly,
514	"""Please forgive me for being so cross.  I came to make it up, and can't"
514	"go away till I have."""
514	""
514	"""It's all right.  Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo,"" was the cavalier"
514	reply to her petition.
514	""
514	"""Thank you, I will.  Could I ask what's the matter?  You don't look"
514	"exactly easy in your mind."""
514	""
514	"""I've been shaken, and I won't bear it!"" growled Laurie indignantly."
514	""
514	"""Who did it?"" demanded Jo."
514	""
514	"""Grandfather.  If it had been anyone else I'd have..."" And the injured"
514	youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.
514	""
514	"""That's nothing.  I often shake you, and you don't mind,"" said Jo"
514	soothingly.
514	""
514	"""Pooh!  You're a girl, and it's fun, but I'll allow no man to shake me!"""
514	""
514	"""I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like"
514	"a thundercloud as you do now.  Why were you treated so?"""
514	""
514	"""Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd"
514	"promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my word."""
514	""
514	"""Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?"""
514	""
514	"""No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the"
514	truth.  I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without
514	bringing Meg in.  As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the
514	scolding till the old gentleman collared me.  Then I bolted, for fear I
514	"should forget myself."""
514	""
514	"""It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know, so go down and make up.  I'll"
514	"help you."""
514	""
514	"""Hanged if I do!  I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by"
514	everyone, just for a bit of a frolic.  I was sorry about Meg, and
514	begged pardon like a man, but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in the
514	"wrong."""
514	""
514	"""He didn't know that."""
514	""
514	"""He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby.  It's no use,"
514	Jo, he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself, and don't
514	"need anyone's apron string to hold on by."""
514	""
514	"""What pepper pots you are!"" sighed Jo.  ""How do you mean to settle this"
514	"affair?"""
514	""
514	"""Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't tell"
514	"him what the fuss's about."""
514	""
514	"""Bless you!  He won't do that."""
514	""
514	"""I won't go down till he does."""
514	""
514	"""Now, Teddy, be sensible.  Let it pass, and I'll explain what I can."
514	"You can't stay here, so what's the use of being melodramatic?"""
514	""
514	"""I don't intend to stay here long, anyway.  I'll slip off and take a"
514	journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he'll come round fast
514	"enough."""
514	""
514	"""I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him."""
514	""
514	"""Don't preach.  I'll go to Washington and see Brooke.  It's gay there,"
514	"and I'll enjoy myself after the troubles."""
514	""
514	"""What fun you'd have!  I wish I could run off too,"" said Jo, forgetting"
514	her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.
514	""
514	"""Come on, then!  Why not?  You go and surprise your father, and I'll"
514	stir up old Brooke.  It would be a glorious joke.  Let's do it, Jo.
514	We'll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once.
514	I've got money enough.  It will do you good, and no harm, as you go to
514	"your father."""
514	""
514	For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan was,
514	it just suited her.  She was tired of care and confinement, longed for
514	change, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel
514	charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun.  Her eyes kindled as
514	they turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house
514	opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.
514	""
514	"""If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time, but"
514	as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home. Don't tempt
514	"me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan."""
514	""
514	"""That's the fun of it,"" began Laurie, who had got a willful fit on him"
514	and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.
514	""
514	"""Hold your tongue!"" cried Jo, covering her ears.  ""'Prunes and prisms'"
514	are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it.  I came here to
514	"moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to think of."""
514	""
514	"""I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had"
514	"more spirit,"" began Laurie insinuatingly."
514	""
514	"""Bad boy, be quiet!  Sit down and think of your own sins, don't go"
514	making me add to mine.  If I get your grandpa to apologize for the
514	"shaking, will you give up running away?"" asked Jo seriously."
514	""
514	"""Yes, but you won't do it,"" answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but"
514	felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.
514	""
514	"""If I can manage the young one, I can the old one,"" muttered Jo, as she"
514	walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head
514	propped up on both hands.
514	""
514	"""Come in!"" and Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as"
514	Jo tapped at his door.
514	""
514	"""It's only me, Sir, come to return a book,"" she said blandly, as she"
514	entered.
514	""
514	"""Want any more?"" asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but"
514	trying not to show it.
514	""
514	"""Yes, please.  I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the second"
514	"volume,"" returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second"
514	dose of Boswell's Johnson, as he had recommended that lively work.
514	""
514	The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the
514	shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed.  Jo skipped up, and
514	sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was
514	really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her
514	visit.  Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in
514	her mind, for after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced
514	round on her, speaking so abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward
514	on the floor.
514	""
514	"""What has that boy been about?  Don't try to shield him.  I know he has"
514	been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home.  I can't get a
514	word from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he
514	"bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room."""
514	""
514	"""He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word"
514	"to anyone,"" began Jo reluctantly."
514	""
514	"""That won't do.  He shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you"
514	softhearted girls.  If he's done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg
514	"pardon, and be punished.  Out with it, Jo. I won't be kept in the dark."""
514	""
514	Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have
514	gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps,
514	and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and
514	brave it out.
514	""
514	"""Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell.  Mother forbade it.  Laurie has confessed,"
514	asked pardon, and been punished quite enough.  We don't keep silence to
514	shield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you
514	interfere.  Please don't.  It was partly my fault, but it's all right
514	now.  So let's forget it, and talk about the _Rambler_ or something
514	"pleasant."""
514	""
514	"""Hang the _Rambler!_  Come down and give me your word that this"
514	harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or
514	impertinent.  If he has, after all your kindness to him, I'll thrash
514	"him with my own hands."""
514	""
514	The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the
514	irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson,
514	whatever he might say to the contrary.  She obediently descended, and
514	made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or
514	forgetting the truth.
514	""
514	"""Hum... ha... well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and"
514	not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn fellow and hard
514	"to manage,"" said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if"
514	he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with
514	an air of relief.
514	""
514	"""So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's horses and"
514	"all the king's men couldn't,"" said Jo, trying to say a kind word for"
514	her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into
514	another.
514	""
514	"""You think I'm not kind to him, hey?"" was the sharp answer."
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear no, Sir.  You are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a"
514	"trifle hasty when he tries your patience.  Don't you think you are?"""
514	""
514	Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,
514	though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief
514	and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the
514	"table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, ""You're right, girl, I am!"
514	I love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and I know how
514	"it will end, if we go on so."""
514	""
514	"""I'll tell you, he'll run away."" Jo was sorry for that speech the"
514	minute it was made.  She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear
514	much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.
514	""
514	Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a
514	troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his
514	table.  It was Laurie's father, who had run away in his youth, and
514	married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he remembered
514	and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.
514	""
514	"""He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it"
514	sometimes, when he gets tired of studying.  I often think I should like
514	to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us, you may
514	"advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India."""
514	""
514	She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently
514	taking the whole as a joke.
514	""
514	"""You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?  Where's your respect for"
514	me, and your proper bringing up?  Bless the boys and girls!  What
514	"torments they are, yet we can't do without them,"" he said, pinching her"
514	"cheeks good-humoredly.  ""Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell"
514	him it's all right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his
514	"grandfather.  I won't bear it."""
514	""
514	"""He won't come, Sir.  He feels badly because you didn't believe him"
514	when he said he couldn't tell.  I think the shaking hurt his feelings
514	"very much."""
514	""
514	Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began
514	to laugh, and she knew the day was won.
514	""
514	"""I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I"
514	"suppose.  What the dickens does the fellow expect?"" and the old"
514	gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.
514	""
514	"""If I were you, I'd write him an apology, Sir.  He says he won't come"
514	down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an
514	absurd way.  A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and
514	bring him down quite amiable.  Try it.  He likes fun, and this way is
514	"better than talking.  I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty."""
514	""
514	Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying
514	"slowly, ""You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed by you and"
514	Beth.  Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this
514	"nonsense."""
514	""
514	The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to
514	another after offering some deep insult.  Jo dropped a kiss on the top
514	of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under
514	Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive,
514	decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door
514	locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly
514	away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for
514	her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of
514	"countenance, ""What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?"" he"
514	added, laughing.
514	""
514	"""No, he was pretty mild, on the whole."""
514	""
514	"""Ah!  I got it all round.  Even you cast me off over there, and I felt"
514	"just ready to go to the deuce,"" he began apologetically."
514	""
514	"""Don't talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my"
514	"son."""
514	""
514	"""I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil"
514	my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will be an
514	"end,"" he said dolefully."
514	""
514	"""Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it.  Men always croak"
514	"when they are hungry,"" and Jo whisked out at the front door after that."
514	""
514	"""That's a 'label' on my 'sect',"" answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he"
514	went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was
514	quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the
514	rest of the day.
514	""
514	Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but
514	the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered.
514	She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good
514	deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her
514	sister's desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the
514	words, 'Mrs. John Brooke', whereat she groaned tragically and cast it
514	into the fire, feeling that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day
514	for her.

514	PLEASANT MEADOWS
514	""
514	Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed.
514	The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning
514	early in the new year.  Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all
514	day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time
514	with doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand.  Her once
514	active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily
514	airing about the house in her strong arms.  Meg cheerfully blackened
514	and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for 'the dear',
514	while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving
514	away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to
514	accept.
514	""
514	As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,
514	and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible
514	or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry
514	Christmas.  Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had
514	bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.
514	After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered
514	effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were
514	rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.
514	""
514	Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid
514	Christmas Day.  Hannah 'felt in her bones' that it was going to be an
514	unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for
514	everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success.  To
514	begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them, then Beth
514	felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's
514	gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the
514	window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie.  The Unquenchables had
514	done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had
514	worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise.  Out in the garden
514	stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of
514	fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a
514	perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a
514	Christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.
514	""
514	    THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH
514	""
514	    God bless you, dear Queen Bess!
514	    May nothing you dismay,
514	    But health and peace and happiness
514	    Be yours, this Christmas day.
514	""
514	    Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,
514	    And flowers for her nose.
514	    Here's music for her pianee,
514	    An afghan for her toes,
514	""
514	    A portrait of Joanna, see,
514	    By Raphael No. 2,
514	    Who laboured with great industry
514	    To make it fair and true.
514	""
514	    Accept a ribbon red, I beg,
514	    For Madam Purrer's tail,
514	    And ice cream made by lovely Peg,
514	    A Mont Blanc in a pail.
514	""
514	    Their dearest love my makers laid
514	    Within my breast of snow.
514	    Accept it, and the Alpine maid,
514	    From Laurie and from Jo.
514	""
514	How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring
514	in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented
514	them.
514	""
514	"""I'm so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I couldn't"
514	"hold one drop more,"" said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo"
514	carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to
514	refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the 'Jungfrau' had
514	sent her.
514	""
514	"""So am I,"" added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the"
514	long-desired _Undine and Sintram_.
514	""
514	"""I'm sure I am,"" echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the"
514	Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a pretty frame.
514	""
514	"""Of course I am!"" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first"
514	"silk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it. ""How can I be"
514	"otherwise?"" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her"
514	husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her hand caressed the
514	brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the
514	girls had just fastened on her breast.
514	""
514	Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the
514	delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is.  Half an hour
514	after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one
514	drop more, the drop came.  Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his
514	head in very quietly.  He might just as well have turned a somersault
514	and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed
514	excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped
514	"up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, ""Here's another"
514	"Christmas present for the March family."""
514	""
514	Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away
514	somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,
514	leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and
514	couldn't.  Of course there was a general stampede, and for several
514	minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things
514	were done, and no one said a word.
514	""
514	Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms.
514	Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by
514	Laurie in the china closet.  Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake,
514	as he somewhat incoherently explained.  And Amy, the dignified, tumbled
514	over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her
514	father's boots in the most touching manner.  Mrs. March was the first
514	"to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, ""Hush!"
514	"Remember Beth."""
514	""
514	But it was too late.  The study door flew open, the little red wrapper
514	appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and
514	Beth ran straight into her father's arms.  Never mind what happened
514	just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the
514	bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.
514	""
514	It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight
514	again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat
514	turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the
514	kitchen.  As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke
514	for his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly
514	remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he
514	precipitately retired.  Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,
514	which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.
514	""
514	Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the
514	fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage
514	of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most
514	estimable and upright young man.  Why Mr. March paused a minute just
514	there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,
514	looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you
514	to imagine.  Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked,
514	rather abruptly, if he wouldn't like to have something to eat.  Jo saw
514	and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and
514	"beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, ""I hate"
514	"estimable young men with brown eyes!"""
514	""
514	There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat
514	turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed,
514	browned, and decorated.  So was the plum pudding, which melted in one's
514	mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a
514	honeypot.  Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,
514	"""For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't"
514	roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin'
514	"of it in a cloth."""
514	""
514	Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom
514	Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy chairs
514	stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her
514	father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit.  They drank
514	healths, told stories, sang songs, 'reminisced', as the old folks say,
514	and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the
514	girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and
514	as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.
514	""
514	"""Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected"
514	"to have.  Do you remember?"" asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had"
514	followed a long conversation about many things.
514	""
514	"""Rather a pleasant year on the whole!"" said Meg, smiling at the fire,"
514	and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.
514	""
514	"""I think it's been a pretty hard one,"" observed Amy, watching the light"
514	shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.
514	""
514	"""I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,"" whispered Beth, who"
514	sat on her father's knee.
514	""
514	"""Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially"
514	the latter part of it.  But you have got on bravely, and I think the
514	"burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,"" said Mr. March,"
514	looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered
514	round him.
514	""
514	"""How do you know?  Did Mother tell you?"" asked Jo."
514	""
514	"""Not much.  Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several"
514	"discoveries today."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, tell us what they are!"" cried Meg, who sat beside him."
514	""
514	"""Here is one."" And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his"
514	chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and
514	"two or three little hard spots on the palm.  ""I remember a time when"
514	this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so.
514	It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this
514	seeming blemishes I read a little history.  A burnt offering has been
514	made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than
514	blisters, and I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will
514	last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches.  Meg, my
514	dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white
514	hands or fashionable accomplishments.  I'm proud to shake this good,
514	industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it
514	"away."""
514	""
514	If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it
514	in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he
514	gave her.
514	""
514	"""What about Jo?  Please say something nice, for she has tried so hard"
514	"and been so very, very good to me,"" said Beth in her father's ear."
514	""
514	He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an
514	unusually mild expression in her face.
514	""
514	"""In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a"
514	"year ago,"" said Mr. March.  ""I see a young lady who pins her collar"
514	straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang,
514	nor lies on the rug as she used to do.  Her face is rather thin and
514	pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for
514	it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower.  She doesn't bounce, but
514	moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly
514	way which delights me.  I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a
514	strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite
514	satisfied. I don't know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep,
514	but I do know that in all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful
514	enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent
514	"me."""
514	""
514	Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew
514	rosy in the firelight as she received her father's praise, feeling that
514	she did deserve a portion of it.
514	""
514	"""Now, Beth,"" said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait."
514	""
514	"""There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will"
514	"slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,"""
514	began their father cheerfully.  But recollecting how nearly he had lost
514	her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his
514	"own, ""I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God."""
514	""
514	After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket
514	at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair...
514	""
514	"""I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her"
514	mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has waited on
514	every one with patience and good humor.  I also observe that she does
514	not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very
514	pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that she has learned to
514	think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try
514	and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay
514	figures.  I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a
514	graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable
514	"daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others."""
514	""
514	"""What are you thinking of, Beth?"" asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her"
514	father and told about her ring.
514	""
514	"""I read in _Pilgrim's Progress_ today how, after many troubles,"
514	Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies
514	bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,
514	"before they went on to their journey's end,"" answered Beth, adding, as"
514	"she slipped out of her father's arms and went to the instrument, ""It's"
514	singing time now, and I want to be in my old place.  I'll try to sing
514	the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard.  I made the
514	"music for Father, because he likes the verses."""
514	""
514	So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and
514	in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her
514	own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song
514	for her.
514	""
514	""
514	    He that is down need fear no fall,
514	    He that is low no pride.
514	    He that is humble ever shall
514	    Have God to be his guide.
514	""
514	    I am content with what I have,
514	    Little be it, or much.
514	    And, Lord!  Contentment still I crave,
514	    Because Thou savest such.
514	""
514	    Fulness to them a burden is,
514	    That go on pilgrimage.
514	    Here little, and hereafter bliss,
514	    Is best from age to age!
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
514	""
514	AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION
514	""
514	Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered
514	about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait
514	upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed
514	by kindness.  As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with
514	the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then
514	'to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed needed to complete their
514	happiness.  But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it,
514	though none confessed the fact.  Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one
514	another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg.  Jo had
514	sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's
514	umbrella, which had been left in the hall.  Meg was absent-minded, shy,
514	and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name
514	"was mentioned.  Amy said, ""Everyone seemed waiting for something, and"
514	"couldn't settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,"""
514	and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as
514	usual.
514	""
514	Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed
514	suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one
514	knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands
514	imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave
514	himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief,
514	and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.
514	""
514	"""What does the goose mean?"" said Meg, laughing and trying to look"
514	unconscious.
514	""
514	"""He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn't"
514	"it?"" answered Jo scornfully."
514	""
514	"""Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true,"" but Meg's voice lingered"
514	"over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her.  ""Please don't"
514	plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and there
514	isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as
514	"before."""
514	""
514	"""We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief has"
514	spoiled you for me.  I see it, and so does Mother.  You are not like
514	your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me.  I don't mean
514	to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all
514	settled.  I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and
514	"have it over quickly,"" said Jo pettishly."
514	""
514	"""I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because Father said"
514	"I was too young,"" began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little"
514	smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on
514	that point.
514	""
514	"""If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or"
514	blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided
514	"no."""
514	""
514	"""I'm not so silly and weak as you think.  I know just what I should"
514	say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares.  There's
514	"no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared."""
514	""
514	Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had
514	unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color
514	varying in her cheeks.
514	""
514	"""Would you mind telling me what you'd say?"" asked Jo more respectfully."
514	""
514	"""Not at all.  You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant,"
514	and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own
514	"affairs of this sort."""
514	""
514	"""Don't mean to have any.  It's fun to watch other people philander, but"
514	"I should feel like a fool doing it myself,"" said Jo, looking alarmed at"
514	the thought.
514	""
514	"""I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.""  Meg"
514	spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often
514	seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.
514	""
514	"""I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,"" said Jo,"
514	rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.
514	""
514	"""Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, 'Thank you, Mr."
514	Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young
514	to enter into any engagement at present, so please say no more, but let
514	"us be friends as we were.'"""
514	""
514	"""Hum, that's stiff and cool enough!  I don't believe you'll ever say"
514	it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do.  If he goes on like the
514	rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his
514	"feelings."""
514	""
514	"""No, I won't.  I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk"
514	"out of the room with dignity."""
514	""
514	Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified
514	exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to
514	sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam
514	in a given time.  Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when
514	someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was
514	anything but hospitable.
514	""
514	"""Good afternoon.  I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your"
514	"father finds himself today,"" said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused"
514	as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.
514	""
514	"""It's very well, he's in the rack.  I'll get him, and tell it you are"
514	"here.""  And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in"
514	her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her
514	speech and air her dignity.  But the instant she vanished, Meg began to
514	sidle toward the door, murmuring...
514	""
514	"""Mother will like to see you.  Pray sit down, I'll call her."""
514	""
514	"""Don't go.  Are you afraid of me, Margaret?"" and Mr. Brooke looked so"
514	hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude.  She
514	blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called
514	her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and
514	sweet it seemed to hear him say it.  Anxious to appear friendly and at
514	her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said
514	gratefully...
514	""
514	"""How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish"
514	"I could thank you for it."""
514	""
514	"""Shall I tell you how?"" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast"
514	in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown
514	eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away
514	and to stop and listen.
514	""
514	"""Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not,"" she said, trying to withdraw her"
514	hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.
514	""
514	"""I won't trouble you.  I only want to know if you care for me a little,"
514	"Meg.  I love you so much, dear,"" added Mr. Brooke tenderly."
514	""
514	This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make
514	"it.  She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, ""I don't"
514	"know,"" so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish"
514	little reply.
514	""
514	He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself
514	as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in
514	"his most persuasive tone, ""Will you try and find out?  I want to know"
514	so much, for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I
514	"am to have my reward in the end or not."""
514	""
514	"""I'm too young,"" faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet"
514	rather enjoying it.
514	""
514	"""I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me."
514	"Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?"""
514	""
514	"""Not if I chose to learn it, but. . ."""
514	""
514	"""Please choose to learn, Meg.  I love to teach, and this is easier than"
514	"German,"" broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that"
514	she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.
514	""
514	His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg
514	saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the
514	satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success.  This nettled
514	her.  Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind,
514	and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little
514	women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her.  She felt
514	excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a
514	"capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, ""I"
514	"don't choose.  Please go away and let me be!"""
514	""
514	Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling
514	about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it
514	rather bewildered him.
514	""
514	"""Do you really mean that?"" he asked anxiously, following her as she"
514	walked away.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I do.  I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says"
514	"I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not."""
514	""
514	"""Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by?  I'll wait and say"
514	nothing till you have had more time.  Don't play with me, Meg.  I
514	"didn't think that of you."""
514	""
514	"""Don't think of me at all.  I'd rather you wouldn't,"" said Meg, taking"
514	a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and her own power.
514	""
514	He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel
514	heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his forehead nor
514	tramped about the room as they did.  He just stood looking at her so
514	wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of
514	herself.  What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had
514	not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.
514	""
514	The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had
514	met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr. March's arrival,
514	drove straight out to see him.  The family were all busy in the back
514	part of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to
514	surprise them.  She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started
514	as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.
514	""
514	"""Bless me, what's all this?"" cried the old lady with a rap of her cane"
514	as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.
514	""
514	"""It's Father's friend.  I'm so surprised to see you!"" stammered Meg,"
514	feeling that she was in for a lecture now.
514	""
514	"""That's evident,"" returned Aunt March, sitting down.  ""But what is"
514	Father's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief
514	"going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,"" with another rap."
514	""
514	"""We were only talking.  Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,"" began Meg,"
514	wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.
514	""
514	"""Brooke?  That boy's tutor?  Ah! I understand now.  I know all about"
514	it.  Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father's letters,
514	"and I made her tell me.  You haven't gone and accepted him, child?"""
514	cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.
514	""
514	"""Hush! He'll hear.  Shan't I call Mother?"" said Meg, much troubled."
514	""
514	"""Not yet.  I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind at"
514	once.  Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook?  If you do, not one
514	penny of my money ever goes to you.  Remember that, and be a sensible
514	"girl,"" said the old lady impressively."
514	""
514	Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of
514	opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.  The best of
514	us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and
514	in love.  If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would
514	probably have declared she couldn't think of it, but as she was
514	preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind
514	that she would.  Inclination as well as perversity made the decision
514	easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with
514	unusual spirit.
514	""
514	"""I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money"
514	"to anyone you like,"" she said, nodding her head with a resolute air."
514	""
514	"""Highty-tighty!  Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You'll be"
514	sorry for it by-and-by, when you've tried love in a cottage and found
514	"it a failure."""
514	""
514	"""It can't be a worse one than some people find in big houses,"" retorted"
514	Meg.
514	""
514	Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did
514	not know her in this new mood.  Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so
514	brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her right to
514	love him, if she liked.  Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and
514	after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she
514	"could, ""Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice.  I mean it"
514	kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake
514	at the beginning.  You ought to marry well and help your family.  It's
514	"your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you."""
514	""
514	"""Father and Mother don't think so.  They like John though he is poor."""
514	""
514	"""Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of"
514	"babies."""
514	""
514	"""I'm glad of it,"" cried Meg stoutly."
514	""
514	"Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. ""This Rook is"
514	"poor and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?"""
514	""
514	"""No, but he has many warm friends."""
514	""
514	"""You can't live on friends, try it and see how cool they'll grow.  He"
514	"hasn't any business, has he?"""
514	""
514	"""Not yet.  Mr. Laurence is going to help him."""
514	""
514	"""That won't last long.  James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and"
514	not to be depended on.  So you intend to marry a man without money,
514	position, or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when
514	you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better?
514	"I thought you had more sense, Meg."""
514	""
514	"""I couldn't do better if I waited half my life!  John is good and wise,"
514	he's got heaps of talent, he's willing to work and sure to get on, he's
514	so energetic and brave.  Everyone likes and respects him, and I'm proud
514	"to think he cares for me, though I'm so poor and young and silly,"" said"
514	Meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.
514	""
514	"""He knows you have got rich relations, child.  That's the secret of his"
514	"liking, I suspect."""
514	""
514	"""Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing?  John is above such"
514	"meanness, and I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so,"" cried Meg"
514	indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's
514	"suspicions.  ""My John wouldn't marry for money, any more than I would."
514	We are willing to work and we mean to wait.  I'm not afraid of being
514	poor, for I've been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him
514	"because he loves me, and I..."""
514	""
514	Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't made up
514	her mind, that she had told 'her John' to go away, and that he might be
514	overhearing her inconsistent remarks.
514	""
514	Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her
514	pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's happy young
514	face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.
514	""
514	"""Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair!  You are a willful child,"
514	and you've lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won't
514	stop.  I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits to see your father
514	now.  Don't expect anything from me when you are married.  Your Mr.
514	"Brooke's friends must take care of you.  I'm done with you forever."""
514	""
514	And slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in high
514	dudgeon.  She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her, for when
514	left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.
514	Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr.
514	"Brooke, who said all in one breath, ""I couldn't help hearing, Meg."
514	Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you do care
514	"for me a little bit."""
514	""
514	"""I didn't know how much till she abused you,"" began Meg."
514	""
514	"""And I needn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?"""
514	""
514	Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the
514	stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced
514	"herself forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, ""Yes,  John,"" and"
514	hiding her face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.
514	""
514	Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly
514	downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound
514	within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to
514	"herself, ""She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is"
514	"settled.  I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it."""
514	""
514	But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the
514	threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth
514	nearly as wide open as her eyes.  Going in to exult over a fallen enemy
514	and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an
514	objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid
514	enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister
514	enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject
514	submission.  Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had
514	suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables
514	actually took her breath away.  At the odd sound the lovers turned and
514	saw her.  Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but 'that man', as
514	Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the
514	"astonished newcomer, ""Sister Jo, congratulate us!"""
514	""
514	That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and
514	making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a
514	word.  Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming
514	"tragically as she burst into the room, ""Oh, do somebody go down quick!"
514	"John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!"""
514	""
514	Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon
514	the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news
514	to Beth and Amy.  The little girls, however, considered it a most
514	agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them,
514	so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles
514	to the rats.
514	""
514	Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great
514	deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends
514	by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his
514	plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.
514	""
514	The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which
514	he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both
514	looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy
514	was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity, Beth
514	beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the
514	young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly
514	evident Aunt March was right in calling them as 'unworldly as a pair of
514	babies'.  No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old
514	room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the
514	family began there.
514	""
514	"""You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?"" said"
514	Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she
514	was planning to make.
514	""
514	"""No, I'm sure I can't.  How much has happened since I said that! It"
514	"seems a year ago,"" answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far"
514	above such common things as bread and butter.
514	""
514	"""The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the"
514	"changes have begun,"" said Mrs. March.  ""In most families there comes,"
514	now and then, a year full of events.  This has been such a one, but it
514	"ends well, after all."""
514	""
514	"""Hope the next will end better,"" muttered Jo, who found it very hard to"
514	see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few
514	persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or
514	lessened in any way.
514	""
514	"""I hope the third year from this will end better.  I mean it shall, if"
514	"I live to work out my plans,"" said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if"
514	everything had become possible to him now.
514	""
514	"""Doesn't it seem very long to wait?"" asked Amy, who was in a hurry for"
514	the wedding.
514	""
514	"""I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short"
514	"time to me,"" answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen"
514	there before.
514	""
514	"""You have only to wait, I am to do the work,"" said John beginning his"
514	labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo
514	to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the
514	"front door banged, ""Here comes Laurie.  Now we shall have some sensible"
514	"conversation."""
514	""
514	But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good
514	spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for 'Mrs. John Brooke',
514	and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had
514	been brought about by his excellent management.
514	""
514	"""I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, for when"
514	he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done though the sky
514	"falls,"" said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his"
514	congratulations.
514	""
514	"""Much obliged for that recommendation.  I take it as a good omen for"
514	"the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,"" answered Mr."
514	Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.
514	""
514	"""I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo's face"
514	alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don't look
514	"festive, ma'am, what's the matter?"" asked Laurie, following her into a"
514	corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.
514	""
514	"""I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and"
514	"shall not say a word against it,"" said Jo solemnly.  ""You can't know"
514	"how hard it is for me to give up Meg,"" she continued with a little"
514	quiver in her voice.
514	""
514	"""You don't give her up.  You only go halves,"" said Laurie consolingly."
514	""
514	"""It can never be the same again.  I've lost my dearest friend,"" sighed"
514	Jo.
514	""
514	"""You've got me, anyhow.  I'm not good for much, I know, but I'll stand"
514	"by you, Jo, all the days of my life.  Upon my word I will!"" and Laurie"
514	meant what he said.
514	""
514	"""I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged.  You are always a great"
514	"comfort to me, Teddy,"" returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands."
514	""
514	"""Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow.  It's all right you"
514	see.  Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately,
514	Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her
514	own little house.  We'll have capital times after she is gone, for I
514	shall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad on some
514	"nice trip or other.  Wouldn't that console you?"""
514	""
514	"""I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may happen in"
514	"three years,"" said Jo thoughtfully."
514	""
514	"""That's true.  Don't you wish you could take a look forward and see"
514	"where we shall all be then?  I do,"" returned Laurie."
514	""
514	"""I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so"
514	"happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved."" And Jo's eyes"
514	went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the
514	prospect was a pleasant one.
514	""
514	Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of
514	the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing
514	the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light
514	of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not
514	copy.  Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who
514	held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead
514	him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low
514	seat, with the grave quiet look which best became her, and Laurie,
514	leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly
514	head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long
514	glass which reflected them both.
514	""
514	""
514	So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.  Whether it ever
514	rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the
514	domestic drama called _Little Women_.

514	LITTLE WOMEN PART 2
514	""
514	In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding...
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
514	""
514	GOSSIP
514	""
514	In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free
514	minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.
514	And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too
514	much 'lovering' in the story, as I fear they may (I'm not afraid the
514	young folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March,
514	"""What can you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a"
514	"dashing young neighbor over the way?"""
514	""
514	The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the
514	quiet family.  The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with
514	his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature
514	as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better
514	than learning, the charity which calls all mankind 'brother', the piety
514	that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.
514	""
514	These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which
514	shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many
514	admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as
514	naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard
514	experience had distilled no bitter drop.  Earnest young men found the
514	gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled
514	women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure of finding the
514	gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel.  Sinners told their sins to the
514	pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved.  Gifted men found
514	a companion in him.  Ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions
514	than their own, and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were
514	beautiful and true, although 'they wouldn't pay'.
514	""
514	To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so
514	they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among his
514	books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience,
514	anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always turned
514	in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred
514	words, husband and father.
514	""
514	The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls
514	into their father's, and to both parents, who lived and labored so
514	faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and
514	bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and
514	outlives death.
514	""
514	Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we
514	saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the
514	hospitals and homes still full of wounded 'boys' and soldiers' widows,
514	decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.
514	""
514	John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent
514	home, and not allowed to return.  He received no stars or bars, but he
514	deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love
514	are very precious when both are in full bloom.  Perfectly resigned to
514	his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for
514	business, and earning a home for Meg.  With the good sense and sturdy
514	independence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more
514	generous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better
514	satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any
514	risks with borrowed money.
514	""
514	Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly
514	in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever, for
514	love is a great beautifier.  She had her girlish ambitions and hopes,
514	and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life
514	must begin.  Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg
514	couldn't help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts,
514	and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have
514	the same.  But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she
514	thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little
514	home awaiting her, and when they sat together in the twilight, talking
514	over their small plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright
514	that she forgot Sallie's splendor and felt herself the richest,
514	happiest girl in Christendom.
514	""
514	Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to
514	Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of
514	the best teachers going, and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would
514	have served a far harder mistress.  So she gave her mornings to duty,
514	her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted
514	herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the
514	fever was a thing of the past.  Not an invalid exactly, but never again
514	the rosy, healthy creature she had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and
514	serene, and busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone's friend,
514	and an angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had
514	learned to know it.
514	""
514	As long as _The Spread Eagle_ paid her a dollar a column for her
514	'rubbish', as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun
514	her little romances diligently.  But great plans fermented in her busy
514	brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a
514	slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to
514	place the name of March upon the roll of fame.
514	""
514	Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was
514	now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please
514	himself.  A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,
514	and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to
514	get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being
514	spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy,
514	if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the
514	kind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who
514	watched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any
514	means, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and
514	believed in him with all their hearts.
514	""
514	Being only 'a glorious human boy', of course he frolicked and flirted,
514	grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions
514	ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came
514	perilously near suspension and expulsion.  But as high spirits and the
514	love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save
514	himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible
514	power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection.  In fact, he
514	rather prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the
514	girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors,
514	dignified professors, and vanquished enemies.  The 'men of my class',
514	were heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits
514	of 'our fellows', and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of
514	these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.
514	""
514	Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among
514	them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of
514	fascination with which she was endowed.  Meg was too much absorbed in
514	her private and particular John to care for any other lords of
514	creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how
514	Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her own element,
514	and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly
514	attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural to her than
514	the decorums prescribed for young ladies.  They all liked Jo immensely,
514	but never fell in love with her, though very few escaped without paying
514	the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine.  And speaking
514	of sentiment brings us very naturally to the 'Dovecote'.
514	""
514	That was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared for
514	Meg's first home.  Laurie had christened it, saying it was highly
514	appropriate to the gentle lovers who 'went on together like a pair of
514	turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo'.  It was a tiny house,
514	with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket
514	handkerchief in the front.  Here Meg meant to have a fountain,
514	shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present
514	the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a
514	dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,
514	undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was
514	merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted.
514	But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no
514	fault from garret to cellar.  To be sure, the hall was so narrow it was
514	fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in
514	whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit,
514	and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of
514	precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin.  But
514	once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more
514	complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the
514	furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory.  There were no
514	marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little
514	parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a
514	stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the
514	pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the
514	loving messages they brought.
514	""
514	I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty
514	because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer
514	could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's
514	artistic hand, or that any store-room was ever better provided with
514	good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her
514	mother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles, and I am morally
514	certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and
514	neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over,
514	and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute 'Mis.  Brooke came
514	home'.  I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a
514	supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to
514	last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three different
514	kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.
514	""
514	People who hire all these things done for them never know what they
514	lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,
514	and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest,
514	from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was
514	eloquent of home love and tender forethought.
514	""
514	What happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping
514	excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter
514	arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains.  In his love of jokes, this
514	young gentleman, though nearly through college, was a much of a boy as
514	ever.  His last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits
514	some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper.  Now
514	a bag of remarkable clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which
514	fell to pieces at the first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the
514	knives, or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left
514	the dirt, labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands,
514	infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the
514	deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for
514	odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own
514	steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.
514	""
514	In vain Meg begged him to stop.  John laughed at him, and Jo called him
514	'Mr. Toodles'.  He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee
514	ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week
514	beheld some fresh absurdity.
514	""
514	Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored
514	soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's setting the
514	table for the first meal.
514	""
514	"""Are you satisfied?  Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you"
514	"should be happy here?"" asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went"
514	through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed to cling
514	together more tenderly than ever.
514	""
514	"""Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so happy that"
514	"I can't talk about it,"" with a look that was far better than words."
514	""
514	"""If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,"" said Amy,"
514	coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether
514	the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.
514	""
514	"""Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try"
514	her way first.  There will be so little to do that with Lotty to run my
514	errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to
514	"keep me from getting lazy or homesick,"" answered Meg tranquilly."
514	""
514	"""Sallie Moffat has four,"" began Amy."
514	""
514	"""If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis"
514	"would have to camp in the garden,"" broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big"
514	blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.
514	""
514	"""Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping with her"
514	fine establishment.  Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling
514	that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in
514	the big one.  It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave
514	themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip.  When I
514	was first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get
514	torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got
514	"heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief."""
514	""
514	"""Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she"
514	does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and the servants
514	"laugh at her,"" said Meg."
514	""
514	"""I did after a while, not to 'mess' but to learn of Hannah how things"
514	should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me.  It was play
514	then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only
514	possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little
514	girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help.  You
514	begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will
514	be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress
514	of a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if
514	"she wishes to be well and honestly served."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that,"" said Meg, listening respectfully to"
514	the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all
514	"absorbing subject of house keeping.  ""Do you know I like this room most"
514	"of all in my baby house,"" added Meg, a minute after, as they went"
514	upstairs and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.
514	""
514	Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and
514	exulting over the goodly array.  All three laughed as Meg spoke, for
514	that linen closet was a joke.  You see, having said that if Meg married
514	'that Brooke' she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt March was
514	rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her
514	repent her vow.  She never broke her word, and was much exercised in
514	her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she
514	could satisfy herself.  Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to
514	buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen,
514	and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the
514	secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt
514	March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could
514	give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first
514	bride.
514	""
514	"""That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see.  I had a young"
514	friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger
514	"bowls for company and that satisfied her,"" said Mrs. March, patting the"
514	damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their
514	fineness.
514	""
514	"""I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me"
514	"all my days, Hannah says.""  And Meg looked quite contented, as well she"
514	might.
514	""
514	A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt
514	basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the road at a
514	great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the
514	gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a hearty...
514	""
514	"""Here I am, Mother!  Yes, it's all right."""
514	""
514	The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him, a
514	kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the
514	little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.
514	""
514	"""For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and"
514	compliments.  Bless you, Beth!  What a refreshing spectacle you are,
514	"Jo.  Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady."""
514	""
514	As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled
514	Beth's hair ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an
514	attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and
514	everyone began to talk.
514	""
514	"""Where is John?"" asked Meg anxiously."
514	""
514	"""Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am."""
514	""
514	"""Which side won the last match, Teddy?"" inquired Jo, who persisted in"
514	feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.
514	""
514	"""Ours, of course.  Wish you'd been there to see."""
514	""
514	"""How is the lovely Miss Randal?"" asked Amy with a significant smile."
514	""
514	"""More cruel than ever.  Don't you see how I'm pining away?"" and Laurie"
514	gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.
514	""
514	"""What's the last joke?  Undo the bundle and see, Meg,"" said Beth, eying"
514	the knobby parcel with curiosity.
514	""
514	"""It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,"""
514	observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid the laughter of
514	the girls.
514	""
514	"""Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just"
514	swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood
514	"in a jiffy.  Nice thing, isn't it?"" and Laurie gave them a sample of"
514	its powers that made them cover up their ears.
514	""
514	"""There's gratitude for you!  And speaking of gratitude reminds me to"
514	mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from
514	destruction.  I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she
514	hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked
514	"like a remarkably plummy one."""
514	""
514	"""I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,"" said Meg in a matronly"
514	tone.
514	""
514	"""I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as"
514	"six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,"" responded"
514	the young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little
514	chandelier.
514	""
514	"""I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this"
514	spick-and-span bower, so as I'm tremendously hungry, I propose an
514	"adjournment,"" he added presently."
514	""
514	"""Mother and I are going to wait for John.  There are some last things"
514	"to settle,"" said Meg, bustling away."
514	""
514	"""Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for"
514	"tomorrow,"" added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque"
514	curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.
514	""
514	"""Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow.  I'm in such a state of exhaustion I"
514	can't get home without help.  Don't take off your apron, whatever you
514	"do, it's peculiarly becoming,"" said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial"
514	aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his
514	feeble steps.
514	""
514	"""Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,"" began Jo,"
514	"as they strolled away together.  ""You must promise to behave well, and"
514	"not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans."""
514	""
514	"""Not a prank."""
514	""
514	"""And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober."""
514	""
514	"""I never do.  You are the one for that."""
514	""
514	"""And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony.  I shall"
514	"certainly laugh if you do."""
514	""
514	"""You won't see me, you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog round"
514	"you will obscure the prospect."""
514	""
514	"""I never cry unless for some great affliction."""
514	""
514	"""Such as fellows going to college, hey?"" cut in Laurie, with suggestive"
514	laugh.
514	""
514	"""Don't be a peacock.  I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company."""
514	""
514	"""Exactly.  I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week?  Pretty amiable?"""
514	""
514	"""Very.  Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he'll take"
514	"it?"" asked Jo rather sharply."
514	""
514	"""Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face and say 'All"
514	"right', if it wasn't?"" and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air."
514	""
514	"""No, I don't."""
514	""
514	"""Then don't go and be suspicious.  I only want some money,"" said"
514	Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.
514	""
514	"""You spend a great deal, Teddy."""
514	""
514	"""Bless you, I don't spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone"
514	"before I know it."""
514	""
514	"""You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and"
514	can't say 'No' to anyone.  We heard about Henshaw and all you did for
514	"him.  If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you,"""
514	said Jo warmly.
514	""
514	"""Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill.  You wouldn't have me let"
514	that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help,
514	"when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?"""
514	""
514	"""Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen"
514	waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I
514	thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and then it
514	breaks out in a new spot.  Just now it's the fashion to be hideous, to
514	make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket,
514	orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots.  If it was cheap
514	ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I
514	"don't get any satisfaction out of it."""
514	""
514	Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack,
514	that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only
514	afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a
514	rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and
514	stuffed it into his pocket.
514	""
514	"""Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul!  I have enough all"
514	through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I'll get
514	myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my
514	"friends."""
514	""
514	"""I'll leave you in peace if you'll only let your hair grow. I'm not"
514	aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks
514	"like a young prize fighter,"" observed Jo severely."
514	""
514	"""This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it,"""
514	returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having
514	voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for
514	quarter-inch-long stubble.
514	""
514	"""By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate"
514	about Amy.  He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and moons about
514	in a most suspicious manner.  He'd better nip his little passion in the
514	"bud, hadn't he?"" added Laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone,"
514	after a minute's silence.
514	""
514	"""Of course he had.  We don't want any more marrying in this family for"
514	"years to come.  Mercy on us, what are the children thinking of?"" and Jo"
514	looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in
514	their teens.
514	""
514	"""It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am. You"
514	are a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left
514	"lamenting,"" said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the"
514	times.
514	""
514	"""Don't be alarmed.  I'm not one of the agreeable sort.  Nobody will"
514	want me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a
514	"family."""
514	""
514	"""You won't give anyone a chance,"" said Laurie, with a sidelong glance"
514	"and a little more color than before in his sunburned face. ""You won't"
514	show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow gets a peep at it
514	by accident and can't help showing that he likes it, you treat him as
514	Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart, throw cold water over him, and get so
514	"thorny no one dares touch or look at you."""
514	""
514	"""I don't like that sort of thing.  I'm too busy to be worried with"
514	nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so. Now don't
514	say any more about it.  Meg's wedding has turned all our heads, and we
514	talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities.  I don't wish to get
514	"cross, so let's change the subject;""  and Jo looked quite ready to"
514	fling cold water on the slightest provocation.
514	""
514	Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in
514	a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the
514	"gate, ""Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next."""
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
514	""
514	THE FIRST WEDDING
514	""
514	The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that
514	morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine,
514	like friendly little neighbors, as they were.  Quite flushed with
514	excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind,
514	whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the
514	dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod
514	and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a
514	welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch,
514	and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest
514	baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle
514	mistress who had loved and tended them so long.
514	""
514	Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest
514	in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it
514	fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk,
514	"lace, nor orange flowers would she have.  ""I don't want a fashionable"
514	wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to
514	"look and be my familiar self."""
514	""
514	So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes
514	and innocent romances of a girlish heart.  Her sisters braided up her
514	pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the
514	valley, which 'her John' liked best of all the flowers that grew.
514	""
514	"""You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely"
514	"that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,"" cried Amy,"
514	surveying her with delight when all was done.
514	""
514	"""Then I am satisfied.  But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don't"
514	mind my dress.  I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it
514	"today,""  and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her"
514	with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not
514	changed the old.
514	""
514	"""Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a few"
514	"minutes with Father quietly in the study,""  and Meg ran down to perform"
514	these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she
514	went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there
514	was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the
514	first bird from the nest.
514	""
514	As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their
514	simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which
514	three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their
514	best just now.
514	""
514	Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with
514	ease, if not grace.  The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,
514	more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure.  There is a
514	fresh collar in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only
514	gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.
514	""
514	Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever.  The beautiful,
514	kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,
514	although it is not sad itself.  It is the shadow of pain which touches
514	the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains
514	and always speaks hopefully of 'being better soon'.
514	""
514	Amy is with truth considered 'the flower of the family', for at sixteen
514	she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, but
514	possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the
514	lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her
514	dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious yet harmonious, and as
514	attractive to many as beauty itself.  Amy's nose still afflicted her,
514	for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and
514	having a decided chin.  These offending features gave character to her
514	whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her
514	wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and
514	abundant than ever.
514	""
514	All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the
514	summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just
514	what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in
514	their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the
514	romance of womanhood.
514	""
514	There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as
514	natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived, she was
514	scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in,
514	to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and
514	to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a
514	grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.
514	""
514	"""Upon my word, here's a state of things!"" cried the old lady, taking"
514	the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her
514	"lavender moire with a great rustle.  ""You oughtn't to be seen till the"
514	"last minute, child."""
514	""
514	"""I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to"
514	criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon.  I'm too happy to
514	care what anyone says or thinks, and I'm going to have my little
514	"wedding just as I like it.  John, dear, here's your hammer.""  And away"
514	went Meg to help 'that man' in his highly improper employment.
514	""
514	"Mr. Brooke didn't even say, ""Thank you,"" but as he stooped for the"
514	unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding door,
514	with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with
514	a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.
514	""
514	A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous
514	"exclamation, ""Jupiter Ammon!  Jo's upset the cake again!"" caused a"
514	momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins
514	arrived, and 'the party came in', as Beth used to say when a child.
514	""
514	"""Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than"
514	"mosquitoes,"" whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and"
514	Laurie's black head towered above the rest.
514	""
514	"""He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant"
514	"if he likes,"" returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware"
514	of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a
514	devotion that nearly distracted her.
514	""
514	There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room
514	as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green
514	arch.  Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up.
514	The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the
514	service more beautiful and solemn.  The bridegroom's hand trembled
514	visibly, and no one heard his replies.  But Meg looked straight up in
514	"her husband's eyes, and said, ""I will!"" with such tender trust in her"
514	own face and voice that her mother's heart rejoiced and Aunt March
514	sniffed audibly.
514	""
514	Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved
514	from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring
514	fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his
514	wicked black eyes.  Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder,
514	but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of
514	sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.
514	""
514	It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly
514	"married, Meg cried, ""The first kiss for Marmee!"" and turning, gave it"
514	with her heart on her lips.  During the next fifteen minutes she looked
514	more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their
514	privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,
514	adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her
514	"in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, ""Bless you, deary, a"
514	hundred times!  The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks
514	"lovely."""
514	""
514	Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried
514	to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are
514	light.  There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the
514	little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful
514	lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt
514	March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and
514	coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes
514	carried round.  No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on
514	serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his
514	hand and a puzzled expression on his face.
514	""
514	"""Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?"" he whispered, ""or am I"
514	merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this
514	"morning?"""
514	""
514	"""No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March"
514	actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and
514	dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home.  You know he thinks that
514	wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she
514	"nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof."""
514	""
514	Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he
514	did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous
514	"way, ""I like that!  For I've seen enough harm done to wish other women"
514	"would think as you do."""
514	""
514	"""You are not made wise by experience, I hope?"" and there was an anxious"
514	accent in Meg's voice.
514	""
514	"""No.  I give you my word for it.  Don't think too well of me, either,"
514	this is not one of my temptations.  Being brought up where wine is as
514	common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for it, but when a
514	"pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see."""
514	""
514	"""But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,"
514	Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest
514	"day of my life."""
514	""
514	A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,
514	for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if
514	he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her
514	power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. She did not speak,
514	but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness,
514	"and a smile which said, ""No one can refuse me anything today."""
514	""
514	Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her
514	"his hand, saying heartily, ""I promise, Mrs. Brooke!"""
514	""
514	"""I thank you, very, very much."""
514	""
514	"""And I drink 'long life to your resolution', Teddy,"" cried Jo,"
514	baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and
514	beamed approvingly upon him.
514	""
514	So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of
514	many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy
514	moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all his
514	life.
514	""
514	After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the
514	house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within.  Meg and
514	John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot,
514	when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing
514	touch to this unfashionable wedding.
514	""
514	"""All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband"
514	and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in
514	"couples outside!"" cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy,"
514	with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their
514	example without a murmur.  Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol
514	began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a
514	moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into
514	the ring.  But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for
514	when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady,
514	she just tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join
514	hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young
514	folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.
514	""
514	Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people
514	began to go.
514	""
514	"""I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think you'll"
514	"be sorry for it,"" said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as"
514	"he led her to the carriage, ""You've got a treasure, young man, see that"
514	"you deserve it."""
514	""
514	"""That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I"
514	"don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it,"" observed Mrs."
514	Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.
514	""
514	"""Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get"
514	one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly
514	"satisfied,"" said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to"
514	rest after the excitement of the morning.
514	""
514	"""I'll do my best to gratify you, Sir,"" was Laurie's unusually dutiful"
514	reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.
514	""
514	The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had
514	was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she
514	came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and
514	straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say
514	'good-by', as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.
514	""
514	"""Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love"
514	"you any the less for loving John so much,"" she said, clinging to her"
514	"mother, with full eyes for a moment.  ""I shall come every day, Father,"
514	and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am
514	married.  Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls
514	will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank
514	"you all for my happy wedding day.  Good-by, good-by!"""
514	""
514	They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender
514	pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with her hands
514	full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy face--and
514	so Meg's married life began.
514	""

514	""
514	CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
514	""
514	ARTISTIC ATTEMPTS
514	""
514	It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and
514	genius, especially ambitious young men and women.  Amy was learning
514	this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for
514	inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.
514	For a long time there was a lull in the 'mud-pie' business, and she
514	devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed
514	such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant
514	and profitable.  But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid
514	aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,
514	the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of
514	burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic
514	and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about
514	promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and
514	the dinner bell at her door in case of fire.  Raphael's face was found
514	boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on
514	the head of a beer barrel.  A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the
514	sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied
514	kindling for some time.
514	""
514	From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy
514	fell to painting with undiminished ardor.  An artist friend fitted her
514	out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed
514	away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on
514	land or sea.  Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken
514	prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her
514	vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer,
514	if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging
514	had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance.  Swarthy boys
514	and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,
514	suggested Murillo; oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in
514	the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants,
514	Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange
514	lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash
514	in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a
514	king's robe, as the spectator pleased.
514	""
514	Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row,
514	looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened
514	into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good,
514	and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were
514	pronounced 'wonderfully fine'.  A return to clay and plaster followed,
514	and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or
514	tumbled off closet shelves onto people's heads.  Children were enticed
514	in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings
514	caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress.  Her
514	efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an
514	untoward accident, which quenched her ardor.  Other models failing her
514	for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family
514	were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running
514	to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed
514	with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened
514	with unexpected rapidity.  With much difficulty and some danger she was
514	dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that
514	her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial
514	of one artistic attempt, at least.
514	""
514	After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her
514	to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and
514	sighing for ruins to copy.  She caught endless colds sitting on damp
514	grass to book 'a delicious bit', composed of a stone, a stump, one
514	mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or 'a heavenly mass of clouds',
514	that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. She
514	sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to
514	study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after
514	'points of sight', or whatever the squint-and-string performance is
514	called.
514	""
514	If 'genius is eternal patience', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had some
514	claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite of all
514	obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing that in time
514	she should do something worthy to be called 'high art'.
514	""
514	She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she
514	had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she
514	never became a great artist.  Here she succeeded better, for she was
514	one of those happily created beings who please without effort, make
514	friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less
514	fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky
514	star.  Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact.  She had
514	an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the
514	right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and
514	"place, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, ""If Amy"
514	went to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what
514	"to do."""
514	""
514	One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in 'our best society',
514	without being quite sure what the best really was.  Money, position,
514	fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable
514	things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed
514	them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not
514	admirable.  Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she
514	cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the
514	opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which
514	poverty now excluded her.
514	""
514	"""My lady,"" as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine"
514	lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy
514	refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and
514	that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.
514	""
514	"""I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma,"" Amy said, coming in with an"
514	important air one day.
514	""
514	"""Well, little girl, what is it?"" replied her mother, in whose eyes the"
514	stately young lady still remained 'the baby'.
514	""
514	"""Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate"
514	for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day.  They are wild
514	to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things
514	they admire in my book.  They have been very kind to me in many ways,
514	and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know I am poor, yet they
514	"never made any difference."""
514	""
514	"""Why should they?"" and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls"
514	called her 'Maria Theresa air'.
514	""
514	"""You know as well as I that it does make a difference with nearly"
514	everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when your
514	chickens get pecked by smarter birds.  The ugly duckling turned out a
514	"swan, you know.""  and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed"
514	a happy temper and hopeful spirit.
514	""
514	Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked,
514	"""Well, my swan, what is your plan?"""
514	""
514	"""I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them"
514	for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river,
514	"perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them."""
514	""
514	"""That looks feasible.  What do you want for lunch?  Cake, sandwiches,"
514	"fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?"""
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear, no!  We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate"
514	and ice cream, besides.  The girls are used to such things, and I want
514	"my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my living."""
514	""
514	"""How many young ladies are there?"" asked her mother, beginning to look"
514	sober.
514	""
514	"""Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come."""
514	""
514	"""Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them"
514	"about."""
514	""
514	"""Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing?  Not more than six or"
514	eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and borrow Mr.
514	"Laurence's cherry-bounce."" (Hannah's pronunciation of char-a-banc.)"
514	""
514	"""All of this will be expensive, Amy."""
514	""
514	"""Not very.  I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself."""
514	""
514	"""Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things,"
514	and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan
514	would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much
514	better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and
514	"attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?"""
514	""
514	"""If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I know"
514	that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help
514	"a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it,"""
514	said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into
514	obstinacy.
514	""
514	Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it
514	was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she
514	would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking
514	advice as much as they did salts and senna.
514	""
514	"""Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way"
514	through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll
514	say no more.  Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you
514	"decide, I'll do my best to help you."""
514	""
514	"""Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind."" and away went Amy to lay her"
514	plan before her sisters.
514	""
514	Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she
514	possessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons.
514	But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with
514	it at first.
514	""
514	"""Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and"
514	turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a
514	sixpence for you?  I thought you had too much pride and sense to
514	truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and
514	"rides in a coupe,"" said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of"
514	her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.
514	""
514	"""I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!"""
514	returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions
514	"arose. ""The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great"
514	deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you
514	call fashionable nonsense.  You don't care to make people like you, to
514	go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes.  I do, and
514	I mean to make the most of every chance that comes.  You can go through
514	the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it
514	"independence, if you like.  That's not my way."""
514	""
514	When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the
514	best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side,
514	while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to
514	such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an
514	argument.  Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a
514	good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more
514	amiable turn.  Much against her will, Jo at length consented to
514	sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she
514	regarded as 'a nonsensical business'.
514	""
514	The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following
514	Monday was set apart for the grand event.  Hannah was out of humor
514	"because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that ""ef the"
514	washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well
514	"anywheres"".  This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had"
514	a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto was 'Nil
514	desperandum', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to
514	do it in spite of all obstacles.  To begin with, Hannah's cooking
514	didn't turn out well.  The chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and
514	the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.  Then the cake and ice cost more
514	than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which
514	seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward.
514	Beth got a cold and took to her bed.  Meg had an unusual number of
514	callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind
514	that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous,
514	serious, and trying.
514	""
514	If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday,
514	an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree.  On
514	Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more
514	exasperating than a steady pour.  It drizzled a little, shone a little,
514	blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late for
514	anyone else to make up theirs.  Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out
514	of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got
514	in order.  The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby, but
514	without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the
514	best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the
514	carpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave
514	an artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo
514	scattered about.
514	""
514	The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped
514	it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver
514	would get safely home again.  The carriages were promised, Meg and
514	Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah
514	behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an
514	absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of
514	everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy
514	cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch
514	safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of
514	artistic delights, for the 'cherry bounce' and the broken bridge were
514	her strong points.
514	""
514	Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor
514	to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock.  A smart
514	shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young
514	ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the
514	exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the
514	perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.
514	""
514	"""No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must"
514	"fly round and be ready for them,"" said Amy, as the sun woke her next"
514	morning.  She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had
514	said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was getting
514	a little stale.
514	""
514	"""I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today,"""
514	said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of
514	placid despair.
514	""
514	"""Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,"" advised"
514	his wife.
514	""
514	"""Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at"
514	"it.  I'm very sorry, Amy,"" added Beth, who was still a patroness of"
514	cats.
514	""
514	"""Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do,"" said Amy"
514	decidedly.
514	""
514	"""Shall I rush into town and demand one?"" asked Jo, with the magnanimity"
514	of a martyr.
514	""
514	"""You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to"
514	"try me.  I'll go myself,"" answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to"
514	fail.
514	""
514	Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she
514	departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and
514	fit her for the labors of the day.  After some delay, the object of her
514	desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further
514	loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her
514	own forethought.
514	""
514	As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,
514	Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to
514	find out where all her money had gone to.  So busy was she with her
514	card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer,
514	who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,
514	"""Good morning, Miss March,"" and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's"
514	most elegant college friends.  Fervently hoping that he would get out
514	before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and
514	congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress,
514	returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.
514	""
514	They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by
514	learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting
514	away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In
514	stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the
514	lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the
514	highborn eyes of a Tudor!
514	""
514	"""By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!"" cried the unconscious youth,"
514	poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing
514	to hand out the basket after the old lady.
514	""
514	"""Please don't--it's--it's mine,"" murmured Amy, with a face nearly as"
514	red as her fish.
514	""
514	"""Oh, really, I beg pardon.  It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?"""
514	said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest
514	that did credit to his breeding.
514	""
514	Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,
514	"and said, laughing, ""Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad"
514	he's going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat
514	"it?"""
514	""
514	Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind
514	were touched.  The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of
514	pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about 'the charming young ladies'
514	diverted his mind from the comical mishap.
514	""
514	"""I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan't see"
514	"them, that's a comfort,"" thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed."
514	""
514	She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that,
514	thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of
514	dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the
514	preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve
514	o'clock all was ready again.  Feeling that the neighbors were
514	interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of
514	yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the
514	'cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests
514	to the banquet.
514	""
514	"""There's the rumble, they're coming!  I'll go onto the porch and meet"
514	them.  It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good
514	"time after all her trouble,"" said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the"
514	word.  But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable
514	expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one
514	young lady.
514	""
514	"""Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It"
514	"will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,"""
514	cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even
514	for a laugh.
514	""
514	In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who
514	had kept her promise.  The rest of the family, being of a dramatic
514	turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a
514	most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the
514	merriment which possessed them.  The remodeled lunch being gaily
514	partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with
514	enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce),
514	and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when
514	'the party went out'.
514	""
514	As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she
514	observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared,
514	except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.
514	""
514	"""You've had a lovely afternoon for your drive, dear,"" said her mother,"
514	as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.
514	""
514	"""Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I"
514	"thought,"" observed Beth, with unusual warmth."
514	""
514	"""Could you spare me some of your cake?  I really need some, I have so"
514	"much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours,"" asked"
514	Meg soberly.
514	""
514	"""Take it all.  I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it"
514	"will mold before I can dispose of it,"" answered Amy, thinking with a"
514	sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.
514	""
514	"""It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us,"" began Jo, as they sat down"
514	to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.
514	""
514	A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the
514	whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,
514	"""salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn..."""
514	Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the 'history of salads',
514	to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.
514	""
514	"""Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels.  Germans"
514	like messes.  I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no reason you
514	"should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool,"" cried Amy,"
514	wiping her eyes.
514	""
514	"""I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about"
514	in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big
514	"nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng,"" sighed"
514	Jo, quite spent with laughter.
514	""
514	"""I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to"
514	"satisfy you,"" said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret."
514	""
514	"""I am satisfied.  I've done what I undertook, and it's not my fault"
514	"that it failed.  I comfort myself with that,"" said Amy with a little"
514	"quiver in her voice.  ""I thank you all very much for helping me, and"
514	I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at
514	"least."""
514	""
514	No one did for several months, but the word 'fete' always produced a
514	general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral
514	lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
514	""
514	LITERARY LESSONS
514	""
514	Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in her
514	path.  Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would
514	have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her
514	in this wise.
514	""
514	Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her
514	scribbling suit, and 'fall into a vortex', as she expressed it, writing
514	away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was
514	finished she could find no peace.  Her 'scribbling suit' consisted of a
514	black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a
514	cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which
514	she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action.  This cap
514	was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these
514	periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads
514	"semi-occasionally to ask, with interest, ""Does genius burn, Jo?"" They"
514	did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an
514	observation of the cap, and judged accordingly.  If this expressive
514	article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that
514	hard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly
514	askew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off,
514	and cast upon the floor.  At such times the intruder silently withdrew,
514	and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow,
514	did anyone dare address Jo.
514	""
514	She did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the writing
514	fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a
514	blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat
514	safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real
514	and dear to her as any in the flesh.  Sleep forsook her eyes, meals
514	stood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness
514	which blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth
514	living, even if they bore no other fruit.  The divine afflatus usually
514	lasted a week or two, and then she emerged from her 'vortex', hungry,
514	sleepy, cross, or despondent.
514	""
514	She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was
514	prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for
514	her virtue was rewarded with a new idea.  It was a People's Course, the
514	lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a
514	subject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great
514	social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding
514	the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy
514	with the price of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying
514	to solve harder riddles than that of the Sphinx.
514	""
514	They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking,
514	Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the
514	seat with them.  On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads
514	and bonnets to match, discussing Women's Rights and making tatting.
514	Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the
514	hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an
514	old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna.  On
514	her right, her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a
514	newspaper.
514	""
514	It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,
514	idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed
514	the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume,
514	tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two
514	infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes,
514	were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying
514	away in the background with her mouth wide open.  Pausing to turn a
514	page, the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half
514	"his paper, saying bluntly, ""want to read it? That's a first-rate story."""
514	""
514	Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for
514	lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,
514	mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light
514	literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author's
514	invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the
514	dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.
514	""
514	"""Prime, isn't it?"" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last"
514	paragraph of her portion.
514	""
514	"""I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,"" returned Jo,"
514	amused at his admiration of the trash.
514	""
514	"""I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could.  She makes a good"
514	"living out of such stories, they say."" and he pointed to the name of"
514	Mrs. S.L.A.N.G.  Northbury, under the title of the tale.
514	""
514	"""Do you know her?"" asked Jo, with sudden interest."
514	""
514	"""No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the"
514	"office where this paper is printed."""
514	""
514	"""Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?"" and Jo"
514	looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled
514	exclamation points that adorned the page.
514	""
514	"""Guess she does!  She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well"
514	"for writing it."""
514	""
514	Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while
514	Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and
514	hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,
514	and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its
514	columns for a sensational story.  By the time the lecture ended and the
514	audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not
514	the first founded on paper), and was already deep in the concoction of
514	her story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before
514	the elopement or after the murder.
514	""
514	She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much
514	to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when
514	'genius took to burning'.  Jo had never tried this style before,
514	contenting herself with very mild romances for _The Spread Eagle_.  Her
514	experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave
514	her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and
514	costumes.  Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her
514	limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to
514	make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an
514	earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement.  The manuscript
514	was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that
514	if the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect,
514	she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.
514	""
514	Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to
514	keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all
514	hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which
514	almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred
514	dollars fell into her lap.  For a minute she stared at it as if it had
514	been a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry.  If the
514	amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what
514	intense happiness he was giving a fellow creature, I think he would
514	devote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo
514	valued the letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and
514	after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned
514	to do something, though it was only to write a sensation story.
514	""
514	A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed
514	herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the
514	letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won
514	the prize.  Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story
514	came everyone read and praised it, though after her father had told her
514	that the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the
514	tragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly
514	way...
514	""
514	"""You can do better than this, Jo.  Aim at the highest, and never mind"
514	"the money."""
514	""
514	"""I think the money is the best part of it.  What will you do with such"
514	"a fortune?"" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a"
514	reverential eye.
514	""
514	"""Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,"" answered Jo"
514	promptly.
514	""
514	To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth didn't
514	come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,
514	while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.  So Jo was
514	satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with
514	a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She
514	did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the
514	house, for by the magic of a pen, her 'rubbish' turned into comforts
514	for them all.  The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill, A Phantom
514	Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys proved the
514	blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.
514	""
514	Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny
514	side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine
514	satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the
514	inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful
514	blessings of the world.  Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and
514	ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that
514	she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.
514	""
514	Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and
514	encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame
514	and fortune.  Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to
514	all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling
514	to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she
514	would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she
514	particularly admired.
514	""
514	"""Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold, pay for"
514	printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what I can
514	for it.  Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is
514	more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this
514	"important subject,"" said Jo, calling a family council."
514	""
514	"""Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,"
514	"and the idea is well worked out.  Let it wait and ripen,"" was her"
514	father's advice, and he practiced what he preached, having waited
514	patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no
514	haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.
514	""
514	"""It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial than by"
514	"waiting,"" said Mrs. March.  ""Criticism is the best test of such work,"
514	for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her
514	to do better next time.  We are too partial, but the praise and blame
514	"of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money."""
514	""
514	"""Yes,"" said Jo, knitting her brows, ""that's just it.  I've been fussing"
514	over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or
514	indifferent.  It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons
514	"take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it."""
514	""
514	"""I wouldn't leave a word out of it.  You'll spoil it if you do, for the"
514	interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the
514	"people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on,"""
514	said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable
514	novel ever written.
514	""
514	"""But Mr. Allen says, 'Leave out the explanations, make it brief and"
514	"dramatic, and let the characters tell the story',"" interrupted Jo,"
514	turning to the publisher's note.
514	""
514	"""Do as he tells you.  He knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a"
514	good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when
514	you've got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical
514	"and metaphysical people in your novels,"" said Amy, who took a strictly"
514	practical view of the subject.
514	""
514	"""Well,"" said Jo, laughing, ""if my people are 'philosophical and"
514	metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,
514	except what I hear father say, sometimes.  If I've got some of his wise
514	ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me.  Now,
514	"Beth, what do you say?"""
514	""
514	"""I should so like to see it printed soon,"" was all Beth said, and"
514	smiled in saying it.  But there was an unconscious emphasis on the last
514	word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike
514	candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a forboding fear,
514	and decided her to make her little venture 'soon'.
514	""
514	So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on
514	her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre.  In the hope of
514	pleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice, and like the old man and
514	his donkey in the fable suited nobody.
514	""
514	Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got
514	into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about
514	it.  Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description.
514	Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story.
514	Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her, while
514	Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo
514	quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the
514	story.  Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and
514	confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into
514	the big, busy world to try its fate.
514	""
514	Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it,
514	likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she
514	expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it
514	took her some time to recover.
514	""
514	"""You said, Mother, that criticism would help me.  But how can it, when"
514	it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a
514	"promising book or broken all the ten commandments?"" cried poor Jo,"
514	turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with
514	"pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next.  ""This man says,"
514	'An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.' 'All is
514	"sweet, pure, and healthy.'"" continued the perplexed authoress.  ""The"
514	next, 'The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies,
514	spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.' Now, as I had no
514	theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism, and copied my
514	characters from life, I don't see how this critic can be right.
514	Another says, 'It's one of the best American novels which has appeared
514	for years.' (I know better than that), and the next asserts that
514	'Though it is original, and written with great force and feeling, it is
514	a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't!  Some make fun of it, some overpraise, and
514	nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only
514	wrote it for the pleasure and the money.  I wish I'd printed the whole
514	"or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged."""
514	""
514	Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally.
514	Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so
514	well and had apparently done so ill.  But it did her good, for those
514	whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an
514	author's best education, and when the first soreness was over, she
514	could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel
514	herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.
514	""
514	"""Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me,"" she said stoutly,"
514	"""and I've got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were"
514	taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd,
514	and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced
514	'charmingly natural, tender, and true'.  So I'll comfort myself with
514	"that, and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take another."""
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
514	""
514	DOMESTIC EXPERIENCES
514	""
514	Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the
514	determination to be a model housekeeper.  John should find home a
514	paradise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously
514	every day, and never know the loss of a button.  She brought so much
514	love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but
514	succeed, in spite of some obstacles.  Her paradise was not a tranquil
514	one, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and
514	bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares.  She was
514	too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course
514	of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare.  As for buttons,
514	she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the
514	carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,
514	and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better
514	than hers.
514	""
514	They were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn't
514	live on love alone.  John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though
514	she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot.  Nor did Meg
514	miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband
514	"followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, ""Shall I send some veal"
514	"or mutton for dinner, darling?"" The little house ceased to be a"
514	glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt
514	that it was a change for the better.  At first they played keep-house,
514	and frolicked over it like children.  Then John took steadily to
514	business, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders,
514	and Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to
514	work, as before said, with more energy than discretion.
514	""
514	While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's
514	Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the
514	problems with patience and care.  Sometimes her family were invited in
514	to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be
514	privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be
514	concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little
514	Hummels.  An evening with John over the account books usually produced
514	a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would
514	ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread
514	pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although
514	he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude.  Before the golden mean was
514	found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young
514	couples seldom get on long without, a family jar.
514	""
514	Fired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with
514	homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John
514	was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra
514	quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be
514	attended to at once.  As John firmly believed that 'my wife' was equal
514	to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that
514	she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most
514	pleasing form for winter use.  Home came four dozen delightful little
514	pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for
514	her.  With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the
514	elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the
514	bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her
514	success, for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times?  The array
514	of pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and
514	the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg
514	resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,
514	straining, and fussing over her jelly.  She did her best, she asked
514	advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah
514	did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but
514	that dreadful stuff wouldn't 'jell'.
514	""
514	She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her a hand,
514	but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with
514	their private worries, experiments, or quarrels.  They had laughed over
514	that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one,
514	but they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on
514	without help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had
514	advised the plan.  So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats
514	all that hot summer day, and at five o'clock sat down in her
514	topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and
514	wept.
514	""
514	"Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, ""My"
514	husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he
514	likes.  I shall always be prepared.  There shall be no flurry, no
514	scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good
514	dinner.  John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you
514	"please, and be sure of a welcome from me."""
514	""
514	How charming that was, to be sure!  John quite glowed with pride to
514	hear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a
514	superior wife.  But, although they had had company from time to time,
514	it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an
514	opportunity to distinguish herself till now.  It always happens so in
514	this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things which
514	we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.
514	""
514	If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have
514	been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the
514	year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly.  Congratulating
514	himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling
514	sure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant
514	anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his pretty
514	wife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend to his
514	mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and
514	husband.
514	""
514	It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached
514	the Dovecote.  The front door usually stood hospitably open. Now it was
514	not only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still adorned the steps.
514	The parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty
514	wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in
514	her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she
514	greeted her guest.  Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a
514	sanginary-looking boy asleep under the current bushes.
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid something has happened.  Step into the garden, Scott, while"
514	"I look up Mrs. Brooke,"" said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude."
514	""
514	Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and
514	Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face.  He paused
514	discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but he could both see
514	and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.
514	""
514	In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair.  One edition of jelly was
514	trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was
514	burning gaily on the stove.  Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly
514	eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly
514	liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat
514	sobbing dismally.
514	""
514	"""My dearest girl, what is the matter?"" cried John, rushing in, with"
514	awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret
514	consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.
514	""
514	"""Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried!  I've been at"
514	"it till I'm all worn out.  Do come and help me or I shall die!"" and the"
514	exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet
514	welcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized
514	at the same time as the floor.
514	""
514	"""What worries you dear?  Has anything dreadful happened?"" asked the"
514	anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was
514	all askew.
514	""
514	"""Yes,"" sobbed Meg despairingly."
514	""
514	"""Tell me quick, then.  Don't cry.  I can bear anything better than"
514	"that.  Out with it, love."""
514	""
514	"""The... The jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!"""
514	""
514	John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, and the
514	derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which
514	put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.
514	""
514	"""Is that all?  Fling it out of the window, and don't bother any more"
514	about it.  I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's sake
514	don't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner,
514	"and..."""
514	""
514	John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a
514	tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of
514	mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay...
514	""
514	"""A man to dinner, and everything in a mess!  John Brooke, how could you"
514	"do such a thing?"""
514	""
514	"""Hush, he's in the garden!  I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can't"
514	"be helped now,"" said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye."
514	""
514	"""You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to"
514	"have remembered how busy I was,"" continued Meg petulantly, for even"
514	turtledoves will peck when ruffled.
514	""
514	"""I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for"
514	I met him on the way out.  I never thought of asking leave, when you
514	have always told me to do as I liked.  I never tried it before, and
514	"hang me if I ever do again!"" added John, with an aggrieved air."
514	""
514	"""I should hope not!  Take him away at once.  I can't see him, and there"
514	"isn't any dinner."""
514	""
514	"""Well, I like that!  Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home, and"
514	"the pudding you promised?"" cried John, rushing to the larder."
514	""
514	"""I hadn't time to cook anything.  I meant to dine at Mother's. I'm"
514	"sorry, but I was so busy,"" and Meg's tears began again."
514	""
514	John was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day's work to
514	come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty
514	table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or
514	manner.  He restrained himself however, and the little squall would
514	have blown over, but for one unlucky word.
514	""
514	"""It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull"
514	through and have a good time yet.  Don't cry, dear, but just exert
514	yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.  We're both as hungry
514	as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is.  Give us the cold meat, and
514	"bread and cheese.  We won't ask for jelly."""
514	""
514	He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his
514	fate.  Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure, and
514	the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.
514	""
514	"""You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can.  I'm too used up"
514	to 'exert' myself for anyone.  It's like a man to propose a bone and
514	vulgar bread and cheese for company.  I won't have anything of the sort
514	in my house.  Take that Scott up to Mother's, and tell him I'm away,
514	sick, dead, anything.  I won't see him, and you two can laugh at me and
514	"my jelly as much as you like.  You won't have anything else here.""  and"
514	having delivered her defiance all on one breath, Meg cast away her
514	pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own
514	room.
514	""
514	What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but Mr.
514	Scott was not taken 'up to Mother's', and when Meg descended, after
514	they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous
514	lunch which filled her with horror.  Lotty reported that they had eaten
514	"""a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the"
514	"sweet stuff, and hide the pots."""
514	""
514	Meg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own
514	"short-comings, of loyalty to John, ""who might be cruel, but nobody"
514	"should know it,"" restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up, she"
514	dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be
514	forgiven.
514	""
514	Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that light.
514	He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little
514	wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his
514	friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but
514	John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that Meg had
514	"deserted him in his hour of need.  ""It wasn't fair to tell a man to"
514	bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you
514	at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to
514	be laughed at or pitied.  No, by George, it wasn't! And Meg must know
514	"it."""
514	""
514	He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over
514	and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over
514	"him.  ""Poor little thing!  It was hard upon her when she tried so"
514	heartily to please me.  She was wrong, of course, but then she was
514	"young.  I must be patient and teach her.""  He hoped she had not gone"
514	home--he hated gossip and interference.  For a minute he was ruffled
514	again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry
514	herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,
514	resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where
514	she had failed in her duty to her spouse.
514	""
514	Meg likewise resolved to be 'calm and kind, but firm', and show him his
514	duty.  She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and
514	comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of
514	the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,
514	as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.
514	""
514	John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling
514	that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came
514	leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly
514	"relevant remark, ""We are going to have a new moon, my dear."""
514	""
514	"""I've no objection,"" was Meg's equally soothing remark.  A few other"
514	topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and
514	wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished.  John went
514	to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,
514	figuratively speaking.  Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if
514	new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither
514	spoke.  Both looked quite 'calm and firm', and both felt desperately
514	uncomfortable.
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear,"" thought Meg, ""married life is very trying, and does need"
514	"infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.""  The word 'Mother'"
514	suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and received with
514	unbelieving protests.
514	""
514	"""John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see"
514	and bear with them, remembering your own.  He is very decided, but
514	never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently.
514	He is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait,
514	though you call him 'fussy'. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg,
514	and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need.
514	He has a temper, not like ours--one flash and then all over--but the
514	white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to
514	quench.  Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against
514	yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect.  Watch
514	yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against
514	the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave
514	"the way for bitter sorrow and regret."""
514	""
514	These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,
514	especially the last.  This was the first serious disagreement, her own
514	hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her
514	own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to
514	such a scene quite melted her heart.  She glanced at him with tears in
514	her eyes, but he did not see them.  She put down her work and got up,
514	"thinking, ""I will be the first to say, 'Forgive me'"", but he did not"
514	seem to hear her.  She went very slowly across the room, for pride was
514	hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head.  For a
514	minute she felt as if she really couldn't do it, then came the thought,
514	"""This is the beginning. I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach"
514	"myself with,"" and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the"
514	forehead. Of course that settled it.  The penitent kiss was better than
514	a world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying
514	tenderly...
514	""
514	"""It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me,"
514	"dear.  I never will again!"""
514	""
514	But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both
514	declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family
514	peace was preserved in that little family jar.
514	""
514	After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and
514	served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first
514	course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made
514	everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a
514	lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all
514	the way home.
514	""
514	In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.  Sallie Moffat
514	renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at
514	the little house, or inviting 'that poor dear' to come in and spend the
514	day at the big house.  It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often
514	felt lonely.  All were busy at home, John absent till night, and
514	nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.  So it naturally fell
514	out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend.
514	Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself
514	because she had not got them.  Sallie was very kind, and often offered
514	her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John
514	wouldn't like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what
514	John disliked even worse.
514	""
514	She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted
514	her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value
514	more--his money.  She knew where it was, was free to take what she
514	liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every
514	penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's
514	wife.  Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her
514	little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without
514	fear.  But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted
514	her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress.  Meg
514	didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor.  It irritated her, but
514	she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console
514	herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she
514	had to economize.  She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty
514	things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn't
514	worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in
514	the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.
514	""
514	But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up
514	her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her.
514	John was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he
514	was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg
514	never forgot it.  A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and
514	it weighed upon her conscience.  Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg
514	longed for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her black
514	silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper
514	for girls.  Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of
514	twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year's.  That was only a month to
514	wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had
514	the money, if she only dared to take it.  John always said what was his
514	was hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective
514	five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund?
514	That was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to
514	lend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg
514	beyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely,
514	"shimmering folds, and said, ""A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am."" She"
514	"answered, ""I'll take it,"" and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie"
514	had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no
514	consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something,
514	and the police were after her.
514	""
514	When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by
514	spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn't
514	become her, after all, and the words 'fifty dollars' seemed stamped
514	like a pattern down each breadth.  She put it away, but it haunted her,
514	not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost
514	of a folly that was not easily laid.  When John got out his books that
514	night, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time in her married life,
514	she was afraid of her husband.  The kind, brown eyes looked as if they
514	could be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had
514	found her out, but didn't mean to let her know it.  The house bills
514	were all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her, and was
514	undoing the old pocketbook which they called the 'bank', when Meg,
514	knowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously...
514	""
514	"""You haven't seen my private expense book yet."""
514	""
514	John never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing so,
514	and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women
514	wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning
514	of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three
514	rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a
514	bonnet, and cost six dollars.  That night he looked as if he would like
514	the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her
514	extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent
514	wife.
514	""
514	The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. Meg
514	got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of
514	his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic
514	increasing with every word...
514	""
514	"""John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really been"
514	dreadfully extravagant lately.  I go about so much I must have things,
514	you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and my New Year's
514	money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after I had done it, for
514	"I knew you'd think it wrong in me."""
514	""
514	John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly,
514	"""Don't go and hide.  I won't beat you if you have got a pair of killing"
514	boots.  I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she does
514	"pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones."""
514	""
514	That had been one of her last 'trifles', and John's eye had fallen on
514	"it as he spoke.  ""Oh, what will he say when he comes to that awful"
514	"fifty dollars!"" thought Meg, with a shiver."
514	""
514	"""It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress,"" she said, with the calmness"
514	of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.
514	""
514	"""Well, dear, what is the 'dem'd total', as Mr. Mantalini says?"""
514	""
514	That didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with
514	the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and
514	answer with one as frank till now.  She turned the page and her head at
514	the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough
514	without the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added.  For
514	a minute the room was very still, then John said slowly--but she could
514	feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure--. . .
514	""
514	"""Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the"
514	"furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days."""
514	""
514	"""It isn't made or trimmed,"" sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden"
514	recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.
514	""
514	"""Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman,"
514	but I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's when she
514	"gets it on,"" said John dryly."
514	""
514	"""I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it.  I don't mean to"
514	waste your money, and I didn't think those little things would count up
514	so.  I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and
514	pitying me because I don't.  I try to be contented, but it is hard, and
514	"I'm tired of being poor."""
514	""
514	The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but
514	he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many
514	pleasures for Meg's sake.  She could have bitten her tongue out the
514	minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up,
514	"saying with a little quiver in his voice, ""I was afraid of this.  I do"
514	"my best, Meg.""  If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not"
514	have broken her heart like those few words.  She ran to him and held
514	"him close, crying, with repentant tears, ""Oh, John, my dear, kind,"
514	hard-working boy.  I didn't mean it!  It was so wicked, so untrue and
514	"ungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!"""
514	""
514	He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach,
514	but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be
514	forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again.  She had
514	promised to love him for better or worse, and then she, his wife, had
514	reproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings
514	recklessly.  It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so
514	quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he
514	stayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry
514	herself to sleep.  A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the
514	discovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat
514	reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold.  He had
514	"simply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, ""I"
514	"can't afford it, my dear."""
514	""
514	Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with
514	her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart would
514	break.
514	""
514	They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband
514	better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,
514	given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him
514	a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings
514	and failures of those he loved.
514	""
514	Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the
514	truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor.  The good-natured Mrs.
514	Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present
514	of it immediately afterward.  Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and
514	when John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new
514	silk gown.  One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his
514	present, and what a blissful state of things ensued.  John came home
514	early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning
514	by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted
514	little wife.  So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to
514	Meg a new experience, the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.
514	""
514	Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday,
514	with an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals, for
514	Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the
514	other.
514	""
514	"""How's the little mamma?  Where is everybody?  Why didn't you tell me"
514	"before I came home?"" began Laurie in a loud whisper."
514	""
514	"""Happy as a queen, the dear!  Every soul of 'em is upstairs a"
514	worshipin'.  We didn't want no hurrycanes round.  Now you go into the
514	"parlor, and I'll send 'em down to you,"" with which somewhat involved"
514	reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.
514	""
514	Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon
514	a large pillow.  Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes twinkled, and
514	there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort.
514	""
514	"""Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,"" she said invitingly."
514	""
514	Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him
514	"with an imploring gesture.  ""No, thank you.  I'd rather not.  I shall"
514	"drop it or smash it, as sure as fate."""
514	""
514	"""Then you shan't see your nevvy,"" said Jo decidedly, turning as if to"
514	go.
514	""
514	"""I will, I will!  Only you must be responsible for damages."" and"
514	obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put
514	into his arms.  A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah,
514	and John caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself
514	invested with two babies instead of one.
514	""
514	No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough
514	to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the
514	unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that
514	Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.
514	""
514	"""Twins, by Jupiter!"" was all he said for a minute, then turning to the"
514	women with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he added,
514	"""Take 'em quick, somebody!  I'm going to laugh, and I shall drop 'em."""
514	""
514	Jo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm,
514	as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending, while Laurie
514	laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.
514	""
514	"""It's the best joke of the season, isn't it?  I wouldn't have told you,"
514	for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I've done
514	"it,"" said Jo, when she got her breath."
514	""
514	"""I never was more staggered in my life.  Isn't it fun?  Are they boys?"
514	What are you going to name them? Let's have another look.  Hold me up,
514	"Jo, for upon my life it's one too many for me,"" returned Laurie,"
514	regarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland
514	looking at a pair of infantile kittens.
514	""
514	"""Boy and girl.  Aren't they beauties?"" said the proud papa, beaming"
514	upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.
514	""
514	"""Most remarkable children I ever saw.  Which is which?"" and Laurie bent"
514	like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.
514	""
514	"""Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French"
514	fashion, so you can always tell.  Besides, one has blue eyes and one
514	"brown.  Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,"" said wicked Jo."
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid they mightn't like it,"" began Laurie, with unusual timidity"
514	in such matters.
514	""
514	"""Of course they will, they are used to it now.  Do it this minute,"
514	"sir!"" commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy."
514	""
514	Laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each
514	little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.
514	""
514	"""There, I knew they didn't like it!  That's the boy, see him kick, he"
514	hits out with his fists like a good one.  Now then, young Brooke, pitch
514	"into a man of your own size, will you?"" cried Laurie, delighted with a"
514	poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.
514	""
514	"""He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother"
514	and grandmother.  We shall call her Daisey, so as not to have two Megs,
514	"and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name,"""
514	said Amy, with aunt-like interest.
514	""
514	"""Name him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short,"" said Laurie."
514	""
514	"""Daisy and Demi, just the thing!  I knew Teddy would do it,"" cried Jo"
514	clapping her hands.
514	""
514	Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were 'Daisy' and
514	'Demi' to the end of the chapter.

514	"""For what?"""
514	""
514	"""You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make"
514	"half a dozen calls with me today?"""
514	""
514	"""I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don't"
514	think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls in one day, when
514	"a single one upsets me for a week."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us.  I was to finish the crayon"
514	of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and return our
514	"neighbors' visits."""
514	""
514	"""If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the letter of my"
514	bond, Shylock.  There is a pile of clouds in the east, it's not fair,
514	"and I don't go."""
514	""
514	"""Now, that's shirking.  It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you"
514	pride yourself on keeping promises, so be honorable, come and do your
514	"duty, and then be at peace for another six months."""
514	""
514	At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking, for she was
514	mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself
514	because she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking
514	to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make
514	calls in her best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the
514	formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain,
514	bribe, or promise.  In the present instance there was no escape, and
514	having clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she
514	smelled thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat
514	and gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.
514	""
514	"""Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint!  You don't"
514	"intend to make calls in that state, I hope,"" cried Amy, surveying her"
514	with amazement.
514	""
514	"""Why not?  I'm neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a dusty"
514	walk on a warm day.  If people care more for my clothes than they do
514	for me, I don't wish to see them.  You can dress for both, and be as
514	elegant as you please.  It pays for you to be fine.  It doesn't for me,
514	"and furbelows only worry me."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, dear!"" sighed Amy, ""now she's in a contrary fit, and will drive me"
514	distracted before I can get her properly ready. I'm sure it's no
514	pleasure to me to go today, but it's a debt we owe society, and there's
514	no one to pay it but you and me.  I'll do anything for you, Jo, if
514	you'll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil.
514	You can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and
514	behave so beautifully, if you try, that I'm proud of you.  I'm afraid
514	"to go alone, do come and take care of me."""
514	""
514	"""You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old"
514	sister in that way.  The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred,
514	and your being afraid to go anywhere alone!  I don't know which is the
514	most absurd.  Well, I'll go if I must, and do my best.  You shall be
514	commander of the expedition, and I'll obey blindly, will that satisfy
514	"you?"" said Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike"
514	submission.
514	""
514	"""You're a perfect cherub!  Now put on all your best things, and I'll"
514	tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good
514	impression.  I want people to like you, and they would if you'd only
514	try to be a little more agreeable.  Do your hair the pretty way, and
514	put the pink rose in your bonnet.  It's becoming, and you look too
514	sober in your plain suit.  Take your light gloves and the embroidered
514	handkerchief.  We'll stop at Meg's, and borrow her white sunshade, and
514	"then you can have my dove-colored one."""
514	""
514	While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not
514	without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled
514	into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet
514	strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she
514	put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out
514	the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the
514	present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her
514	hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last
514	touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of
514	countenance, saying meekly...
514	""
514	"""I'm perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, I die"
514	"happy."""
514	""
514	"""You're highly satisfactory.  Turn slowly round, and let me get a"
514	"careful view."" Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then"
514	"fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously, ""Yes,"
514	you'll do.  Your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with
514	the rose is quite ravishing.  Hold back your shoulders, and carry your
514	hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch.  There's one thing you
514	can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl.  I can't, but it's very nice to
514	see you, and I'm so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one.  It's
514	simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic.
514	Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress
514	evenly? I like to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose
514	"isn't."""
514	""
514	"""You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,"" said Jo, looking through"
514	her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the
514	"golden hair.  ""Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it"
514	"up, please, ma'am?"""
514	""
514	"""Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house.  The sweeping"
514	style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts
514	gracefully.  You haven't half buttoned one cuff, do it at once.  You'll
514	never look finished if you are not careful about the little details,
514	"for they make up the pleasing whole."""
514	""
514	Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing
514	up her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as
514	'pretty as picters', Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window
514	to watch them.
514	""
514	"""Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so"
514	I want you to put on your best deportment.  Don't make any of your
514	abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you?  Just be calm, cool, and
514	quiet, that's safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen
514	"minutes,"" said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed"
514	the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.
514	""
514	"""Let me see.  'Calm, cool, and quiet', yes, I think I can promise that."
514	I've played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I'll try it
514	off.  My powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy in your mind,
514	"my child."""
514	""
514	Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during
514	the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold
514	correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as
514	silent as the sphinx.  In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her 'charming
514	novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera,
514	and the fashions.  Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a
514	"demure ""Yes"" or ""No"" with the chill on.  In vain Amy telegraphed the"
514	word 'talk', tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with
514	her foot.  Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment
514	like Maud's face, 'icily regular, splendidly null'.
514	""
514	"""What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!"" was"
514	the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door
514	closed upon their guests.  Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall,
514	but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very
514	naturally laid the blame upon Jo.
514	""
514	"""How could you mistake me so?  I merely meant you to be properly"
514	dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and
514	stone.  Try to be sociable at the Lambs'.  Gossip as other girls do,
514	and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes
514	up.  They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to
514	"know, and I wouldn't fail to make a good impression there for anything."""
514	""
514	"""I'll be agreeable.  I'll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and"
514	raptures over any trifle you like.  I rather enjoy this, and now I'll
514	imitate what is called 'a charming girl'.  I can do it, for I have May
514	Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her.  See if the Lambs don't
514	"say, 'What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!"""
514	""
514	Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there
514	was no knowing where she would stop.  Amy's face was a study when she
514	saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all the young
514	ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and
514	join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken
514	possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to
514	hear a long account of Lucretia's last attack, while three delightful
514	young gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush
514	in and rescue her.  So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who
514	seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as
514	the lady.  A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her
514	ears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with
514	curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the
514	fun.  One may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this
514	sort of conversation.
514	""
514	"""She rides splendidly.  Who taught her?"""
514	""
514	"""No one.  She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting"
514	straight on an old saddle in a tree.  Now she rides anything, for she
514	doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have horses cheap
514	because she trains them to carry ladies so well.  She has such a
514	passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails, she can be a
514	"horsebreaker, and get her living so."""
514	""
514	At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the
514	impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady, which
514	was her especial aversion.  But what could she do?  For the old lady
514	was in the middle of her story, and long before it was done, Jo was off
514	again, making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful
514	blunders.
514	""
514	"""Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone,"
514	and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that
514	you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. Nice animal for
514	"a pleasure party, wasn't it?"""
514	""
514	"""Which did she choose?"" asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who"
514	enjoyed the subject.
514	""
514	"""None of them.  She heard of a young horse at the farm house over the"
514	river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try,
514	because he was handsome and spirited.  Her struggles were really
514	pathetic.  There was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she
514	took the saddle to the horse.  My dear creature, she actually rowed it
514	over the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the
514	"utter amazement of the old man!"""
514	""
514	"""Did she ride the horse?"""
514	""
514	"""Of course she did, and had a capital time.  I expected to see her"
514	brought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and was the
514	"life of the party."""
514	""
514	"""Well, I call that plucky!"" and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving"
514	glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the
514	girl look so red and uncomfortable.
514	""
514	She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a
514	sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress.  One
514	of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore
514	to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it
514	was bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness,
514	"""Oh, Amy painted it.  You can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ours"
514	"any color we like.  It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister."""
514	""
514	"""Isn't that an original idea?"" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun."
514	""
514	"""That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There's"
514	nothing the child can't do.  Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for
514	Sallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest
514	"shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,"""
514	added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments that
514	exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her
514	cardcase at her.
514	""
514	"""We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,"""
514	observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady,
514	who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.
514	""
514	Any mention of her 'works' always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either
514	grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a brusque
514	"remark, as now.  ""Sorry you could find nothing better to read.  I write"
514	that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it.  Are you
514	"going to New York this winter?"""
514	""
514	As Miss Lamb had 'enjoyed' the story, this speech was not exactly
514	grateful or complimentary.  The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake,
514	but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was
514	for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an
514	abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their
514	mouths.
514	""
514	"""Amy, we must go.  Good-by, dear, do come and see us.  We are pining"
514	for a visit.  I don't dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you should
514	"come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away."""
514	""
514	Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing style
514	that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong
514	desire to laugh and cry at the same time.
514	""
514	"""Didn't I do well?"" asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away."
514	""
514	"""Nothing could have been worse,"" was Amy's crushing reply. ""What"
514	possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and
514	"boots, and all the rest of it?"""
514	""
514	"""Why, it's funny, and amuses people.  They know we are poor, so it's no"
514	use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season,
514	"and have things as easy and fine as they do."""
514	""
514	"""You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our"
514	poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way.  You haven't a bit of proper
514	pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to
514	"speak,"" said Amy despairingly."
514	""
514	Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with
514	the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.
514	""
514	"""How shall I behave here?"" she asked, as they approached the third"
514	mansion.
514	""
514	"""Just as you please.  I wash my hands of you,"" was Amy's short answer."
514	""
514	"""Then I'll enjoy myself.  The boys are at home, and we'll have a"
514	comfortable time.  Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance
514	"has a bad effect upon my constitution,"" returned Jo gruffly, being"
514	disturbed by her failure to suit.
514	""
514	An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children
514	speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the
514	hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted
514	herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing.  She
514	listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and
514	"poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that ""Tom Brown was a brick,"""
514	regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a
514	visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma
514	to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left
514	in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and
514	dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an
514	inspired Frenchwoman.
514	""
514	Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself
514	to her heart's content.  Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady
514	who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole
514	family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and
514	breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best
514	of us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which
514	set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming
514	of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has
514	something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like
514	that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while
514	she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled.
514	But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the
514	British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the
514	proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from
514	this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping
514	that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which
514	should bring disgrace upon the name of March.
514	""
514	It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad.  For Jo sat on the
514	grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog
514	reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related
514	one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience.  One small child was
514	poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating
514	gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her
514	gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her
514	damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come
514	"again, ""It was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks."""
514	""
514	"""Capital boys, aren't they?  I feel quite young and brisk again after"
514	"that."" said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from"
514	habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.
514	""
514	"""Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?"" asked Amy, wisely refraining from"
514	any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.
514	""
514	"""Don't like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his"
514	father, and doesn't speak respectfully of his mother.  Laurie says he
514	is fast, and I don't consider him a desirable acquaintance, so I let
514	"him alone."""
514	""
514	"""You might treat him civilly, at least.  You gave him a cool nod, and"
514	just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,
514	whose father keeps a grocery store.  If you had just reversed the nod
514	"and the bow, it would have been right,"" said Amy reprovingly."
514	""
514	"""No, it wouldn't,"" returned Jo, ""I neither like, respect, nor admire"
514	Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece was a third
514	cousin to a lord.  Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever.
514	I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman
514	"in spite of the brown paper parcels."""
514	""
514	"""It's no use trying to argue with you,"" began Amy."
514	""
514	"""Not the least, my dear,"" interrupted Jo, ""so let us look amiable, and"
514	drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I'm deeply
514	"grateful."""
514	""
514	The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo
514	uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being
514	told that the young ladies were engaged.
514	""
514	"""Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today.  We can run down"
514	there any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the dust in our
514	"best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross."""
514	""
514	"""Speak for yourself, if you please.  Aunt March likes to have us pay"
514	her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call. It's a
514	little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don't believe it
514	will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping
514	boys spoil them.  Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your
514	"bonnet."""
514	""
514	"""What a good girl you are, Amy!"" said Jo, with a repentant glance from"
514	her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and
514	"spotless still.  ""I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to"
514	please people as it is for you.  I think of them, but it takes too much
514	time to do them, so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and
514	"let the small ones slip, but they tell best in the end, I fancy."""
514	""
514	Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,
514	"""Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, for they"
514	have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you'd
514	remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked than I am,
514	"because there is more of you."""
514	""
514	"""I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing to own"
514	that you are right, only it's easier for me to risk my life for a
514	person than to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it.  It's a
514	"great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn't it?"""
514	""
514	"""It's a greater not to be able to hide them.  I don't mind saying that"
514	I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm not called upon
514	to tell him so.  Neither are you, and there is no use in making
514	"yourself disagreeable because he is."""
514	""
514	"""But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and"
514	how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any
514	good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddie to manage.  But
514	there are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word,
514	"and I say we ought to do it to others if we can."""
514	""
514	"""Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample of other"
514	"boys,"" said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have"
514	"convulsed the 'remarkable boy' if he had heard it.  ""If we were belles,"
514	or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but
514	for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don't approve
514	of them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn't have a
514	particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and
514	"puritanical."""
514	""
514	"""So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely"
514	because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's a nice sort
514	"of morality."""
514	""
514	"""I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of the world,"
514	and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their
514	"pains.  I don't like reformers, and I hope you never try to be one."""
514	""
514	"""I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the"
514	laughing the world would never get on without them.  We can't agree
514	about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new. You will
514	get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should
514	"rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think."""
514	""
514	"""Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your new ideas."""
514	""
514	"""I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with some"
514	particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her.  It's
514	"my doom, and I can't help it."""
514	""
514	They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very
514	interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a
514	conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their
514	nieces.  Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but
514	Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper and pleased
514	everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind.  This amiable spirit
514	was felt at once, and both aunts 'my deared' her affectionately,
514	"looking what they afterward said emphatically, ""That child improves"
514	"every day."""
514	""
514	"""Are you going to help about the fair, dear?"" asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy"
514	sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well
514	in the young.
514	""
514	"""Yes, Aunt.  Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a"
514	"table, as I have nothing but my time to give."""
514	""
514	"""I'm not,"" put in Jo decidedly.  ""I hate to be patronized, and the"
514	Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with their highly
514	connected fair.  I wonder you consented, Amy, they only want you to
514	"work."""
514	""
514	"""I am willing to work.  It's for the freedmen as well as the Chesters,"
514	and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun.
514	"Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant."""
514	""
514	"""Quite right and proper.  I like your grateful spirit, my dear. It's a"
514	pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts.  Some do not, and
514	"that is trying,"" observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at"
514	Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.
514	""
514	If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance
514	for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but
514	unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot see
514	what goes on in the minds of our friends.  Better for us that we cannot
514	as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a
514	saving of time and temper.  By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of
514	several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of
514	holding her tongue.
514	""
514	"""I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave.  I'd"
514	"rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent."""
514	""
514	"""Ahem!"" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March."
514	""
514	"""I told you so,"" said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol."
514	""
514	Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in
514	the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.
514	""
514	"""Do you speak French, dear?"" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy's."
514	""
514	"""Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often"
514	"as I like,"" replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old"
514	lady to smile affably.
514	""
514	"""How are you about languages?"" asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo."
514	""
514	"""Don't know a word.  I'm very stupid about studying anything, can't"
514	"bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language,"" was the"
514	brusque reply.
514	""
514	Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy,
514	"""You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe?  Eyes don't"
514	"trouble you any more, do they?"""
514	""
514	"""Not at all, thank you, ma'am.  I'm very well, and mean to do great"

514	"joyful time arrives."""
514	""
514	"""Good girl!  You deserve to go, and I'm sure you will some day,"" said"
514	Aunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her
514	ball for her.

514	squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to
514	peep into Jo's face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry
514	that it was impossible to help laughing.
514	""
514	"""Most observing bird,"" said the old lady."
514	""
514	"""Come and take a walk, my dear?"" cried Polly, hopping toward the china"
514	closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.
514	""
514	"""Thank you, I will.  Come Amy."" and Jo brought the visit to an end,"
514	feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon
514	her constitution.  She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy
514	kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the
514	impression of shadow and sunshine, which impression caused Aunt March
514	to say, as they vanished...
514	""
514	"""You'd better do it, Mary.  I'll supply the money."" and Aunt Carrol to"
514	"reply decidedly, ""I certainly will, if her father and mother consent."""

514	CHAPTER THIRTY
514	""
514	CONSEQUENCES
514	""
514	Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was
514	considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be
514	invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the
514	matter.  Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all
514	parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her
514	life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on
514	easily.  The 'haughty, uninteresting creature' was let severely alone,
514	but Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the
514	art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate
514	and valuable contributions to it.
514	""
514	Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then
514	there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost
514	impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young,
514	with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.
514	""
514	May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater
514	favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling
514	circumstances occurred to increase the feeling.  Amy's dainty
514	pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases--that was one
514	thorn.  Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at
514	a late party and only once with May--that was thorn number two.  But
514	the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for
514	her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had
514	whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the
514	Lambs'. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her
514	naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the
514	frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape.  No hint of this had
514	reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when,
514	the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches
514	to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the
514	supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a
514	cold look...
514	""
514	"""I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about"
514	my giving this table to anyone but my girls.  As this is the most
514	prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are
514	the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take
514	this place.  I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in
514	the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have
514	"another table if you like."""
514	""
514	Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this
514	little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to
514	utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking straight at
514	her full of surprise and trouble.
514	""
514	Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess
514	what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did,
514	"""Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?"""
514	""
514	"""Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg.  It's merely a matter"
514	of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this
514	table is considered their proper place.  I think it very appropriate to
514	you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty, but
514	we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you
514	have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't you like the flower table? The
514	little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged.  You could make a
514	charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you
514	"know."""
514	""
514	"""Especially to gentlemen,"" added May, with a look which enlightened Amy"
514	as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor.  She colored angrily,
514	but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with
514	unexpected amiability...
514	""
514	"""It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester.  I'll give up my place here"
514	"at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like."""
514	""
514	"""You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,"" began"
514	May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty
514	racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so
514	carefully made and so gracefully arranged.  She meant it kindly, but
514	Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly...
514	""
514	"""Oh, certainly, if they are in your way,"" and sweeping her"
514	contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that
514	herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.
514	""
514	"""Now she's mad.  Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak,  Mama,"""
514	said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.
514	""
514	"""Girls' quarrels are soon over,"" returned her mother, feeling a trifle"
514	ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.
514	""
514	The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which
514	cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell
514	to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically.
514	But everything seemed against her.  It was late, and she was tired.
514	Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the
514	little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered
514	like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless
514	efforts to preserve the most perfect order.  The evergreen arch
514	wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to
514	tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled.  Her best
514	tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's
514	cheek.  She bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a
514	draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the
514	morrow.  Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will
514	sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task.
514	""
514	There was great indignation at home when she told her story that
514	evening.  Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done
514	right.  Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all, and Jo
514	demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean
514	people to get on without her.
514	""
514	"""Because they are mean is no reason why I should be.  I hate such"
514	things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to
514	show it.  They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy
514	"actions, won't they, Marmee?"""
514	""
514	"""That's the right spirit, my dear.  A kiss for a blow is always best,"
514	"though it's not very easy to give it sometimes,"" said her mother, with"
514	the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and
514	practicing.
514	""
514	In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,
514	Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her
514	enemy by kindness.  She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that
514	came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her
514	table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling
514	the baskets, she took up her pet production, a little book, the antique
514	cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which
514	on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts.
514	As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable
514	pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think.
514	Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little
514	spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns
514	"and flowers, were the words, ""Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."""
514	""
514	"""I ought, but I don't,"" thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright"
514	page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not
514	hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled.  Amy stood a
514	minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet
514	rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise
514	and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in
514	street, school, office, or home.  Even a fair table may become a
514	pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out
514	of season.  Amy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that
514	text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do,
514	took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.
514	""
514	A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty
514	things, and talking over the change of saleswomen.  They dropped their
514	voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the
514	story and judging accordingly.  It was not pleasant, but a better
514	spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving
514	it.  She heard May say sorrowfully...
514	""
514	"""It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't"
514	want to fill up with odds and ends.  The table was just complete then.
514	"Now it's spoiled."""
514	""
514	"""I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her,"" suggested someone."
514	""
514	"""How could I after all the fuss?"" began May, but she did not finish,"
514	for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...
514	""
514	"""You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them.  I"
514	was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your
514	table rather than mine.  Here they are, please take them, and forgive
514	"me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night."""
514	""
514	As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile,
514	and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly
514	thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.
514	""
514	"""Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?"" cried one girl."
514	""
514	May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was
514	evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a
514	"disagreeable laugh, ""Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn't sell them"
514	"at her own table."""
514	""
514	Now, that was hard.  When we make little sacrifices we like to have
514	them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done
514	it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is, as
514	she presently discovered, for her spirits began to rise, and her table
514	to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that
514	one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.
514	""
514	It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind her
514	table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon.  Few
514	cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long
514	before night.
514	""
514	The art table was the most attractive in the room.  There was a crowd
514	about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and
514	fro with important faces and rattling money boxes.  Amy often looked
514	wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and
514	happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do.  It might seem no
514	hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not
514	only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his
514	friends made it a real martyrdom.
514	""
514	She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet
514	that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no
514	complaint, and did not even tell what she had done.  Her mother gave
514	her an extra cordial cup of tea.  Beth helped her dress, and made a
514	charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by
514	getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the
514	tables were about to be turned.
514	""
514	"""Don't do anything rude, pray Jo; I won't have any fuss made, so let it"
514	"all pass and behave yourself,"" begged Amy, as she departed early,"
514	hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little
514	table.
514	""
514	"""I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I"
514	know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and
514	"his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet."" returned"
514	Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.  Presently the familiar
514	tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.
514	""
514	"""Is that my boy?"""
514	""
514	"""As sure as this is my girl!"" and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm"
514	with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.
514	""
514	"""Oh, Teddy, such doings!"" and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal."
514	""
514	"""A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I'll be"
514	hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down
514	"before her table afterward,"" said Laurie, espousing her cause with"
514	warmth.
514	""
514	"""The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not"
514	arrive in time.  I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I
514	shouldn't wonder if they never came at all.  When people do one mean
514	"thing they are very likely to do another,"" observed Jo in a disgusted"
514	tone.
514	""
514	"""Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to."""
514	""
514	"""I didn't know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was"
514	"poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some."""
514	""
514	"""Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They are"
514	"just as much yours as mine.  Don't we always go halves in everything?"""
514	began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.
514	""
514	"""Gracious, I hope not!  Half of some of your things wouldn't suit me at"
514	all.  But we mustn't stand philandering here.  I've got to help Amy, so
514	you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll be so very kind as to
514	let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll bless you
514	"forever."""
514	""
514	"""Couldn't you do it now?"" asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut"
514	the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the
514	"bars, ""Go away, Teddy, I'm busy."""
514	""
514	Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for
514	Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a lovely basket arranged
514	in his best manner for a centerpiece.  Then the March family turned out
514	en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only
514	came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and
514	apparently enjoying themselves very much.  Laurie and his friends
514	gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,
514	encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in
514	the room.  Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing
514	more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the
514	conclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.
514	""
514	Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily
514	surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the Hall, picking
514	up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of
514	the Chester change of base.  She reproached herself for her share of
514	the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible.  She
514	also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and
514	considered her a model of magnanimity.  As she passed the art table,
514	she glanced over it for her sister's things, but saw no sign of them.
514	"""Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,"" thought Jo, who could forgive"
514	her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her family.
514	""
514	"""Good evening, Miss Jo.  How does Amy get on?"" asked May with a"
514	conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be
514	generous.
514	""
514	"""She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is"
514	enjoying herself.  The flower table is always attractive, you know,
514	"'especially to gentlemen'."" Jo couldn't resist giving that little slap,"
514	but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to
514	praising the great vases, which still remained unsold.
514	""
514	"""Is Amy's illumination anywhere about?  I took a fancy to buy that for"
514	"Father,"" said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister's work."
514	""
514	"""Everything of Amy's sold long ago.  I took care that the right people"
514	"saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,"" returned"
514	May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy had,
514	that day.
514	""
514	Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked
514	both touched and surprised by the report of May's word and manner.
514	""
514	"""Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables"
514	"as generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,"" she said,"
514	ordering out 'Teddy's own', as the girls called the college friends.
514	""
514	"""'Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table, but do your"
514	duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of art in every sense
514	"of the word,"" said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx"
514	prepared to take the field.
514	""
514	"""To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,"" said little"
514	Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and
514	getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...
514	""
514	"""Very well, my son, for a small boy!"" and walked him off, with a"
514	paternal pat on the head.
514	""
514	"""Buy the vases,"" whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals"
514	of fire on her enemy's head.
514	""
514	To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but
514	pervaded the hall with one under each arm.  The other gentlemen
514	speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and
514	wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted
514	fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.
514	""
514	Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said
514	something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam
514	with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and
514	anxiety, though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till
514	several days later.
514	""
514	The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnight, she
514	did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look
514	which said 'forgive and forget'.  That satisfied Amy, and when she got
514	home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a
514	"great bouquet in each.  ""The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,"""
514	as Laurie announced with a flourish.
514	""
514	"""You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character"
514	than I ever gave you credit for, Amy.  You've behaved sweetly, and I
514	"respect you with all my heart,"" said Jo warmly, as they brushed their"
514	hair together late that night.
514	""
514	"""Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive.  It must"
514	have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting your heart
514	on selling your own pretty things.  I don't believe I could have done
514	"it as kindly as you did,"" added Beth from her pillow."
514	""
514	"""Why, girls, you needn't praise me so.  I only did as I'd be done by."
514	You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true
514	gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know
514	how.  I can't explain exactly, but I want to be above the little
514	meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women.  I'm far
514	"from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mother is."""
514	""
514	"Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, ""I understand now"
514	what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You are getting on
514	faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in true politeness,
514	for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you'll get
514	"your reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall."""
514	""
514	A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be
514	delighted.  A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's face was
514	illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and Beth, who
514	were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.
514	""
514	"""Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants..."""
514	""
514	"""Me to go with her!"" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an"
514	uncontrollable rapture.
514	""
514	"""No, dear, not you.  It's Amy."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, Mother!  She's too young, it's my turn first.  I've wanted it so"
514	long.  It would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid.  I
514	"must go!"""
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo.  Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is"
514	"not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor."""
514	""
514	"""It's always so.  Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn't"
514	"fair, oh, it isn't fair!"" cried Jo passionately."
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid it's partly your own fault, dear.  When Aunt spoke to me"
514	the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent
514	spirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said--'I
514	planned at first to ask Jo, but as 'favors burden her', and she 'hates
514	French', I think I won't venture to invite her.  Amy is more docile,
514	will make a good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the
514	"trip may give her."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue!  Why can't I learn to keep it"
514	"quiet?"" groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing.  When"
514	she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said
514	sorrowfully...
514	""
514	"""I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time, so"
514	try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure by
514	"reproaches or regrets."""
514	""
514	"""I'll try,"" said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the"
514	"basket she had joyfully upset.  ""I'll take a leaf out of her book, and"
514	try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute
514	of happiness.  But it won't be easy, for it is a dreadful
514	"disappointment,"" and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held"
514	with several very bitter tears.
514	""
514	"""Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm glad you"
514	"are not going quite yet,"" whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and"
514	all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted
514	in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears,
514	and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how
514	gratefully she would bear it.
514	""
514	By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family
514	jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without
514	repinings at Amy's good fortune.  The young lady herself received the
514	news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,
514	and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving
514	such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in
514	visions of art than herself.
514	""
514	"""It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,"" she said impressively, as"
514	"she scraped her best palette.  ""It will decide my career, for if I have"
514	any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove
514	"it."""
514	""
514	"""Suppose you haven't?"" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new"
514	collars which were to be handed over to Amy.
514	""
514	"""Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,"" replied the"
514	aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she made a wry face
514	at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on
514	vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.
514	""
514	"""No, you won't.  You hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man,"
514	"and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,"" said Jo."
514	""
514	"""Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one"
514	will.  I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I
514	"should like to be able to help those who are,"" said Amy, smiling, as if"
514	the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor
514	drawing teacher.
514	""
514	"""Hum!"" said Jo, with a sigh.  ""If you wish it you'll have it, for your"
514	"wishes are always granted--mine never."""
514	""
514	"""Would you like to go?"" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with"
514	her knife.
514	""
514	"""Rather!"""
514	""
514	"""Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum"
514	"for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many times."""
514	""
514	"""Thank you.  I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day"
514	"comes, if it ever does,"" returned Jo, accepting the vague but"
514	magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.
514	""
514	There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment
514	till Amy was off.  Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue
514	ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried
514	till she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the
514	steamer sailed.  Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it
514	suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her
514	and those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last
514	lingerer, saying with a sob...
514	""
514	"""Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen..."""
514	""
514	"""I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I'll come and comfort"
514	"you,"" whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to"
514	keep his word.
514	""
514	So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and
514	beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from
514	the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall
514	the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see
514	nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.

514	CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
514	""
514	OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT
514	""
514	London
514	""
514	Dearest People, Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,
514	Piccadilly.  It's not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped here years
514	ago, and won't go anywhere else.  However, we don't mean to stay long,
514	so it's no great matter.  Oh, I can't begin to tell you how I enjoy it
514	all!  I never can, so I'll only give you bits out of my notebook, for
514	I've done nothing but sketch and scribble since I started.
514	""
514	I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but after
514	that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty of
514	pleasant people to amuse me.  Everyone was very kind to me, especially
514	the officers.  Don't laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary
514	aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one, and as they have
514	nothing to do, it's a mercy to make them useful, otherwise they would
514	smoke themselves to death, I'm afraid.
514	""
514	Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, so
514	when I had done what I could for them, I went and enjoyed myself.  Such
514	walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves!  It was
514	almost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so
514	grandly.  I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her so much
514	good.  As for Jo, she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or
514	whatever the high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and
514	tooted on the captain's speaking trumpet, she'd have been in such a
514	state of rapture.
514	""
514	It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found
514	it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here and there,
514	ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's countryseats in the
514	valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in the morning,
514	but I didn't regret getting up to see it, for the bay was full of
514	little boats, the shore so picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead.  I
514	never shall forget it.
514	""
514	At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, and when
514	I said something about the Lakes of Killarney, he sighed, and sung,
514	with a look at me...
514	""
514	"    ""Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?"
514	    She lives on the banks of Killarney;
514	    From the glance of her eye,
514	    Shun danger and fly,
514	"    For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney."""
514	""
514	Wasn't that nonsensical?
514	""
514	We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours.  It's a dirty, noisy place,
514	and I was glad to leave it.  Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of
514	dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved
514	_a la_ mutton chop, the first thing. Then he flattered himself that he
514	looked like a true Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned
514	off his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American stood in
514	"them, and said, with a grin, ""There yer har, sir.  I've given 'em the"
514	"latest Yankee shine.""  It amused Uncle immensely.  Oh, I must tell you"
514	what that absurd Lennox did!  He got his friend Ward, who came on with
514	us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room was
514	"a lovely one, with ""Robert Lennox's compliments,"" on the card.  Wasn't"
514	that fun, girls? I like traveling.
514	""
514	I never shall get to London if I don't hurry.  The trip was like riding
514	through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. The
514	farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves,
514	latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors.  The
514	very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in
514	clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got
514	nervous like Yankee biddies.  Such perfect color I never saw, the grass
514	so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a
514	rapture all the way.  So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to
514	the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the
514	rate of sixty miles an hour.  Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but
514	Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn't be astonished at anything. This
514	"is the way we went on.  Amy, flying up--""Oh, that must be Kenilworth,"
514	"that gray place among the trees!""  Flo, darting to my window--""How"
514	"sweet!  We must go there sometime, won't we Papa?"" Uncle, calmly"
514	"admiring his boots--""No, my dear, not unless you want beer, that's a"
514	"brewery."""
514	""
514	"A pause--then Flo cried out, ""Bless me, there's a gallows and a man"
514	"going up.""  ""Where, where?"" shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts"
514	"with a crossbeam and some dangling chains.  ""A colliery,"" remarks"
514	"Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye.  ""Here's a lovely flock of lambs all"
514	"lying down,"" says Amy.  ""See, Papa, aren't they pretty?"" added Flo"
514	"sentimentally.  ""Geese, young ladies,"" returns Uncle, in a tone that"
514	keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the _Flirtations of
514	Captain Cavendish_, and I have the scenery all to myself.
514	""
514	Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be
514	seen but fog and umbrellas.  We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little
514	between the showers.  Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off
514	in such a hurry I wasn't half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a
514	muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw.  Shopping
514	in Regent Street is perfectly splendid.  Things seem so cheap, nice
514	ribbons only sixpence a yard.  I laid in a stock, but shall get my
514	gloves in Paris.  Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?
514	""
514	Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt and
514	Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward that
514	it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone.  It was so
514	droll!  For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so
514	fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him, but he was up
514	outside behind somewhere, and I couldn't get at him.  He didn't hear me
514	call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite
514	helpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck
514	pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on
514	poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said...
514	""
514	"""Now, then, mum?"""
514	""
514	I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, with
514	"an ""Aye, aye, mum,"" the man made his horse walk, as if going to a"
514	"funeral.  I poked again and said, ""A little faster,"" then off he went,"
514	helter-skelter as before, and we resigned ourselves to our fate.
514	""
514	Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are more
514	aristocratic than we look.  The Duke of Devonshire lives near.  I often
514	see his footmen lounging at the back gate, and the Duke of Wellington's
514	house is not far off.  Such sights as I saw, my dear!  It was as good
514	as Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and
514	yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet
514	coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front.  Smart maids, with
514	the rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep,
514	dandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and
514	tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side,
514	looking so funny I longed to sketch them.
514	""
514	Rotten Row means 'Route de Roi', or the king's way, but now it's more
514	like a riding school than anything else.  The horses are splendid, and
514	the men, especially the grooms, ride well, but the women are stiff, and
514	bounce, which isn't according to our rules.  I longed to show them a
514	tearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in
514	their scant habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy
514	Noah's Ark.  Everyone rides--old men, stout ladies, little
514	children--and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I saw a pair
514	exchange rose buds, for it's the thing to wear one in the button-hole,
514	and I thought it rather a nice little idea.
514	""
514	In the P.M.  to Westminster Abbey, but don't expect me to describe it,
514	that's impossible, so I'll only say it was sublime! This evening we are
514	going to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate end to the happiest
514	day of my life.
514	""
514	It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning without
514	telling you what happened last evening.  Who do you think came in, as
514	we were at tea?  Laurie's English friends, Fred and Frank Vaughn!  I
514	was so surprised, for I shouldn't have known them but for the cards.
514	Both are tall fellows with whiskers, Fred handsome in the English
514	style, and Frank much better, for he only limps slightly, and uses no
514	crutches.  They had heard from Laurie where we were to be, and came to
514	ask us to their house, but Uncle won't go, so we shall return the call,
514	and see them as we can.  They went to the theater with us, and we did
514	have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I
514	talked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other
514	all our days.  Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was sorry to hear of
514	her ill health.  Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his
514	'respectful compliments to the big hat'. Neither of them had forgotten
514	Camp Laurence, or the fun we had there.  What ages ago it seems,
514	doesn't it?
514	""
514	Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must stop.  I
514	really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing here so late,
514	with my room full of pretty things, and my head a jumble of parks,
514	"theaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures who say ""Ah!"" and twirl"
514	their blond mustaches with the true English lordliness.  I long to see
514	you all, and in spite of my nonsense am, as ever, your loving...
514	""
514	AMY
514	""
514	""
514	PARIS
514	""
514	Dear girls,
514	""
514	In my last I told you about our London visit, how kind the Vaughns
514	were, and what pleasant parties they made for us.  I enjoyed the trips
514	to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything else, for
514	at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons, and at the Museum, rooms full of
514	pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great
514	creatures.  The day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular
514	English picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I
514	could copy, also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up.  We 'did'
514	London to our heart's content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry
514	to go away, for though English people are slow to take you in, when
514	they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in
514	hospitality, I think.  The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter,
514	and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they don't, for Grace and I
514	are great friends, and the boys very nice fellows, especially Fred.
514	""
514	Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again, saying he
514	had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland. Aunt looked sober
514	at first, but he was so cool about it she couldn't say a word.  And now
514	we get on nicely, and are very glad he came, for he speaks French like
514	a native, and I don't know what we should do without him.  Uncle
514	doesn't know ten words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if
514	it would make people understand him.  Aunt's pronunciation is
514	old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we
514	knew a good deal, find we don't, and are very grateful to have Fred do
514	the '_parley vooing_', as Uncle calls it.
514	""
514	Such delightful times as we are having!  Sight-seeing from morning till
514	night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay _cafes_, and meeting with
514	all sorts of droll adventures.  Rainy days I spend in the Louvre,
514	revelling in pictures.  Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of
514	the finest, because she has no soul for art, but I have, and I'm
514	cultivating eye and taste as fast as I can.  She would like the relics
514	of great people better, for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and
514	gray coat, his baby's cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie
514	Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's sword,
514	and many other interesting things.  I'll talk for hours about them when
514	I come, but haven't time to write.
514	""
514	The Palais Royale is a heavenly place, so full of _bijouterie_ and
514	lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't buy them.
514	Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't allow it.  Then the
514	Bois and Champs Elysees are _tres magnifique_. I've seen the imperial
514	family several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the
514	empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought--purple
514	dress, green hat, and yellow gloves. Little Nap is a handsome boy, who
514	sits chatting to his tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he
514	passes in his four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets
514	and a mounted guard before and behind.
514	""
514	We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely, though the
514	antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. Pere la Chaise is very
514	curious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking in,
514	one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for
514	the mourners to sit in when they come to lament.  That is so Frenchy.
514	""
514	Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the balcony, we look
514	up and down the long, brilliant street.  It is so pleasant that we
514	spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our day's work to
514	go out.  Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most
514	agreeable young man I ever knew--except Laurie, whose manners are more
514	charming.  I wish Fred was dark, for I don't fancy light men, however,
514	the Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won't
514	find fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.
514	""
514	Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as we shall travel
514	fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty letters.  I keep my diary,
514	and try to 'remember correctly and describe clearly all that I see and
514	admire', as Father advised. It is good practice for me, and with my
514	sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.
514	""
514	"Adieu, I embrace you tenderly. _""Votre Amie.""_"
514	""
514	""
514	HEIDELBERG
514	""
514	My dear Mamma,
514	""
514	Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I'll try to tell you
514	what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you will see.
514	""
514	The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed it with
514	all my might.  Get Father's old guidebooks and read about it.  I
514	haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At Coblentz we had a
514	lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with whom Fred got acquainted
514	on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a moonlight night, and about
514	one o'clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our
514	windows.  We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed
514	us Fred and the students singing away down below.  It was the most
514	romantic thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, the great
514	fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart
514	of stone.
514	""
514	When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble
514	for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing
514	away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose.  Next morning Fred showed me
514	one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket, and looked very
514	sentimental.  I laughed at him, and said I didn't throw it, but Flo,
514	which seemed to disgust him, for he tossed it out of the window, and
514	turned sensible again.  I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble with that
514	boy, it begins to look like it.
514	""
514	The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where Fred lost
514	some money, and I scolded him.  He needs someone to look after him when
514	Frank is not with him.  Kate said once she hoped he'd marry soon, and I
514	quite agree with her that it would be well for him.  Frankfurt was
514	delightful.  I saw Goethe's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's
514	famous 'Ariadne.'  It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it
514	more if I had known the story better.  I didn't like to ask, as
514	everyone knew it or pretended they did.  I wish Jo would tell me all
514	about it.  I ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything,
514	and it mortifies me.
514	""
514	Now comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred has just
514	gone.  He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him.
514	I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the
514	serenade night.  Since then I've begun to feel that the moonlight
514	walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him
514	than fun.  I haven't flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you
514	said to me, and have done my very best.  I can't help it if people like
514	me.  I don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for
514	them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart.  Now I know Mother will
514	"shake her head, and the girls say, ""Oh, the mercenary little wretch!"","
514	but I've made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him,
514	though I'm not madly in love.  I like him, and we get on comfortably
514	together.  He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich--ever so
514	much richer than the Laurences.  I don't think his family would object,
514	and I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous
514	people, and they like me.  Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the
514	estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is!  A city house in a
514	fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as
514	comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe
514	in.  I like it, for it's genuine.  I've seen the plate, the family
514	jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its
514	park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses.  Oh, it would be
514	all I should ask!  And I'd rather have it than any title such as girls
514	snap up so readily, and find nothing behind.  I may be mercenary, but I
514	hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I can
514	help.  One of us _must_ marry well.  Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't
514	yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all round.  I wouldn't marry
514	a man I hated or despised.  You may be sure of that, and though Fred is
514	not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond
514	enough of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked.
514	So I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it
514	was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me.  He said nothing, but
514	little things showed it.  He never goes with Flo, always gets on my
514	side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we
514	are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me.
514	Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then
514	said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about '_ein
514	wonderschones Blondchen'_, Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his
514	meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate.  He isn't one of the
514	cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood
514	in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.
514	""
514	Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at least all
514	of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to the Post
514	Restante for letters.  We had a charming time poking about the ruins,
514	the vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens made by
514	the elector long ago for his English wife.  I liked the great terrace
514	best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms
514	inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the
514	wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it.  I felt as if I'd
514	got into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling through
514	the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and
514	waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl.  I had a feeling that
514	something was going to happen and I was ready for it.  I didn't feel
514	blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little excited.
514	""
514	By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying through the
514	great arch to find me.  He looked so troubled that I forgot all about
514	myself, and asked what the matter was.  He said he'd just got a letter
514	begging him to come home, for Frank was very ill.  So he was going at
514	once on the night train and only had time to say good-by.  I was very
514	sorry for him, and disappointed for myself, but only for a minute
514	because he said, as he shook hands, and said it in a way that I could
514	"not mistake,  ""I shall soon come back, you won't forget me, Amy?"""
514	""
514	I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied, and
514	there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes, for he was
514	off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know he wanted to
514	speak, but I think, from something he once hinted, that he had promised
514	his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while, for he is a rash
514	boy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law.  We shall
514	"soon meet in Rome, and then, if I don't change my mind, I'll say ""Yes,"
514	"thank you,"" when he says ""Will you, please?"""
514	""
514	Of course this is all _very private_, but I wished you to know what was
514	going on.  Don't be anxious about me, remember I am your 'prudent Amy',
514	and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as much advice as you
514	like.  I'll use it if I can.  I wish I could see you for a good talk,
514	Marmee.  Love and trust me.

514	"""Jo, I'm anxious about Beth."""
514	""
514	"""Why, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the babies came."""
514	""
514	"""It's not her health that troubles me now, it's her spirits. I'm sure"
514	"there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is."""
514	""
514	"""What makes you think so, Mother?"""
514	""
514	"""She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father as much as"
514	she used.  I found her crying over the babies the other day.  When she
514	sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in
514	her face that I don't understand. This isn't like Beth, and it worries
514	"me."""
514	""
514	"""Have you asked her about it?"""
514	""
514	"""I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my questions or"
514	looked so distressed that I stopped.  I never force my children's
514	"confidence, and I seldom have to wait for long."""
514	""
514	Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed
514	quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's, and after
514	"sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, ""I think she is growing up,"
514	and so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears and fidgets,
514	without knowing why or being able to explain them.  Why, Mother, Beth's
514	eighteen, but we don't realize it, and treat her like a child,
514	"forgetting she's a woman."""
514	""
514	"""So she is.  Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,"" returned her mother"
514	with a sigh and a smile.
514	""
514	"""Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of"
514	worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by one.  I promise
514	"never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you."""
514	""
514	"""It's a great comfort, Jo.  I always feel strong when you are at home,"
514	now Meg is gone.  Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon,
514	"but when the tug comes, you are always ready."""
514	""
514	"""Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there must always be"
514	one scrub in a family.  Amy is splendid in fine works and I'm not, but
514	I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up, or half
514	the family fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing herself abroad, but
514	"if anything is amiss at home, I'm your man."""
514	""
514	"""I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender little"
514	heart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else.  Be very kind, and don't
514	let her think anyone watches or talks about her.  If she only would get
514	"quite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn't have a wish in the world."""
514	""
514	"""Happy woman!  I've got heaps."""
514	""
514	"""My dear, what are they?"""
514	""
514	"""I'll settle Bethy's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine. They are"
514	"not very wearing, so they'll keep."" and Jo stitched away, with a wise"
514	nod which set her mother's heart at rest about her for the present at
514	least.
514	""
514	While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and
514	after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which
514	seemed to explain the change in her.  A slight incident gave Jo the
514	clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did
514	the rest.  She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon,
514	when she and Beth were alone together.  Yet as she scribbled, she kept
514	her eye on her sister, who seemed unusually quiet.  Sitting at the
514	window, Beth's work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head
514	upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the
514	dull, autumnal landscape.  Suddenly some one passed below, whistling
514	"like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, ""All serene! Coming"
514	"in tonight."""
514	""
514	Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by
514	"till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, ""How"
514	"strong and well and happy that dear boy looks."""
514	""
514	"""Hum!"" said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face, for the bright"
514	color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a
514	tear lay shining on the window ledge.  Beth whisked it off, and in her
514	half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill.
514	Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring something about
514	needing more paper.
514	""
514	"""Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!"" she said, sitting down in her own"
514	room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had
514	"just made.  ""I never dreamed of such a thing. What will Mother say?  I"
514	"wonder if her...""  there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden"
514	"thought.  ""If he shouldn't love back again, how dreadful it would be."
514	"He must.  I'll make him!"" and she shook her head threateningly at the"
514	picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.
514	"""Oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance.  Here's Meg married and a"
514	mamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love.  I'm the only
514	"one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief."" Jo thought intently"
514	for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out
514	her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face
514	"opposite, ""No thank you, sir, you're very charming, but you've no more"
514	stability than a weathercock.  So you needn't write touching notes and
514	smile in that insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I
514	"won't have it."""
514	""
514	Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake
514	till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which
514	only confirmed her suspicion.  Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked
514	with Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,
514	but so was everybody's. Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he
514	cared more for her than for the others.  Indeed, a general impression
514	had prevailed in the family of late that 'our boy' was getting fonder
514	than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject
514	and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known
514	the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they
514	"would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, ""I told you so."""
514	But Jo hated 'philandering', and wouldn't allow it, always having a
514	joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger.
514	""
514	When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month,
514	but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much
514	amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope,
514	despair, and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly
514	conferences.  But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at
514	many shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged
514	occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom.  Then he avoided the tender
514	subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,
514	and gave out that he was going to 'dig', intending to graduate in a
514	blaze of glory.  This suited the young lady better than twilight
514	confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the
514	eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred
514	imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former
514	could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter
514	were less manageable.
514	""
514	Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo
514	watched Laurie that night as she had never done before.  If she had not
514	got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in
514	the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her.  But
514	having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at
514	a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course
514	of romance writing, did not come to the rescue.  As usual Beth lay on
514	the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all
514	sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly 'spin', and he never
514	disappointed her.  But that evening Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested
514	on the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that
514	she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting
514	cricket match, though the phrases, 'caught off a tice', 'stumped off
514	his ground', and 'the leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her
514	as Sanskrit.  She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,
514	that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that
514	he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a
514	little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an
514	assiduity that was really almost tender.
514	""
514	"""Who knows?  Stranger things have happened,"" thought Jo, as she fussed"
514	"about the room.  ""She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make"
514	life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love
514	each other.  I don't see how he can help it, and I do believe he would
514	"if the rest of us were out of the way."""
514	""
514	As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she
514	ought to dispose of herself with all speed.  But where should she go?
514	And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she
514	sat down to settle that point.
514	""
514	Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa--long, broad,
514	well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the
514	girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back,
514	rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested
514	tired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young
514	women.  They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner
514	had always been Jo's favorite lounging place.  Among the many pillows
514	that adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with
514	prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end.
514	This repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon
514	of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.
514	""
514	Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep
514	aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when
514	romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he
514	most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner.  If 'the sausage' as they
514	called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might approach and
514	repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to man, woman, or child
514	who dared disturb it!  That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner,
514	and had not been in her seat five minutes, before a massive form
514	appeared beside her, and with both arms spread over the sofa back, both
514	long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of
514	satisfaction...
514	""
514	"""Now, this is filling at the price."""
514	""
514	"""No slang,"" snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.  But it was too late,"
514	there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared
514	in a most mysterious manner.
514	""
514	"""Come, Jo, don't be thorny.  After studying himself to a skeleton all"
514	"the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it."""
514	""
514	"""Beth will pet you.  I'm busy."""
514	""
514	"""No, she's not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort of thing,"
514	unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it.  Have you? Do you hate
514	"your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?"""
514	""
514	Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard,
514	"but Jo quenched 'her boy' by turning on him with a stern query, ""How"
514	"many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?"""
514	""
514	"""Not one, upon my word.  She's engaged.  Now then."""
514	""
514	"""I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances, sending"
514	"flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two pins,"""
514	continued Jo reprovingly.
514	""
514	"""Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't let me"
514	send them 'flowers and things', so what can I do? My feelings need a
514	"'vent'."""
514	""
514	"""Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do flirt"
514	"desperately, Teddy."""
514	""
514	"""I'd give anything if I could answer, 'So do you'.  As I can't, I'll"
514	merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little game, if
514	"all parties understand that it's only play."""
514	""
514	"""Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done. I've"
514	tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else
514	"is doing, but I don't seem to get on"", said Jo, forgetting to play"
514	mentor.
514	""
514	"""Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far.  I"
514	suppose it's natural to some people to please without trying, and
514	"others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place."""
514	""
514	"""I'm glad you can't flirt.  It's really refreshing to see a sensible,"
514	straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool
514	of herself.  Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I know really do
514	go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them. They don't mean any harm, I'm
514	sure, but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward,
514	"they'd mend their ways, I fancy."""
514	""
514	"""They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows"
514	get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit.  If you
514	behaved properly, they would, but knowing you like their nonsense, they
514	"keep it up, and then you blame them."""
514	""
514	"""Much you know about it, ma'am,"" said Laurie in a superior tone. ""We"
514	don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did sometimes.
514	The pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully,
514	among gentleman. Bless your innocent soul!  If you could be in my place
514	for a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my
514	word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls, I always want to say
514	with our friend Cock Robin...
514	""
514	"    ""Out upon you, fie upon you,"
514	"     Bold-faced jig!"""
514	""
514	It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between
514	Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his very
514	natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society
514	showed him many samples.  Jo knew that 'young Laurence' was regarded as
514	a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their
514	daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb
514	of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be
514	spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still
514	believed in modest girls.  Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone,
514	"she said, dropping her voice, ""If you must have a 'vent', Teddy, go and"
514	devote yourself to one of the 'pretty, modest girls' whom you do
514	"respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones."""
514	""
514	"""You really advise it?"" and Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of"
514	anxiety and merriment in his face.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through college, on the"
514	whole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime.  You're not half
514	"good enough for--well, whoever the modest girl may be."" and Jo looked a"
514	little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.
514	""
514	"""That I'm not!"" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite"
514	new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently wound Jo's apron tassel
514	round his finger.
514	""
514	"""Mercy on us, this will never do,"" thought Jo, adding aloud, ""Go and"
514	"sing to me.  I'm dying for some music, and always like yours."""
514	""
514	"""I'd rather stay here, thank you."""
514	""
514	"""Well, you can't, there isn't room.  Go and make yourself useful, since"
514	you are too big to be ornamental.  I thought you hated to be tied to a
514	"woman's apron string?"" retorted Jo, quoting certain rebellious words of"
514	his own.
514	""
514	"""Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!"" and Laurie gave an audacious"
514	tweak at the tassel.
514	""
514	"""Are you going?"" demanded Jo, diving for the pillow."
514	""
514	"He fled at once, and the minute it was well, ""Up with the bonnets of"
514	"bonnie Dundee,"" she slipped away to return no more till the young"
514	gentleman departed in high dudgeon.
514	""
514	Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the sound
514	of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth's bedside, with the anxious
514	"inquiry, ""What is it, dear?"""
514	""
514	"""I thought you were asleep,"" sobbed Beth."
514	""
514	"""Is it the old pain, my precious?"""
514	""
514	"""No, it's a new one, but I can bear it,"" and Beth tried to check her"
514	tears.
514	""
514	"""Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the other."""
514	""
514	"""You can't, there is no cure.""  There Beth's voice gave way, and"
514	clinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly that Jo was
514	frightened.
514	""
514	"""Where is it?  Shall I call Mother?"""
514	""
514	"""No, no, don't call her, don't tell her.  I shall be better soon.  Lie"
514	down here and 'poor' my head.  I'll be quiet and go to sleep, indeed I
514	"will."""
514	""
514	Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth's hot
514	forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full and she longed to
514	speak.  But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,
514	cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so though she
514	believed she knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she only said, in her
514	"tenderest tone, ""Does anything trouble you, deary?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, Jo,"" after a long pause."
514	""
514	"""Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?"""
514	""
514	"""Not now, not yet."""
514	""
514	"""Then I won't ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and Jo are always"
514	"glad to hear and help you, if they can."""
514	""
514	"""I know it.  I'll tell you by-and-by."""
514	""
514	"""Is the pain better now?"""
514	""
514	"""Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo."""
514	""
514	"""Go to sleep, dear.  I'll stay with you."""
514	""
514	So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite
514	herself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long, and
514	a loving word can medicine most ills.
514	""
514	But Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a project for
514	some days, she confided it to her mother.
514	""
514	"""You asked me the other day what my wishes were.  I'll tell you one of"
514	"them, Marmee,"" she began, as they sat along together.  ""I want to go"
514	"away somewhere this winter for a change."""
514	""
514	"""Why, Jo?"" and her mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested"
514	a double meaning.
514	""
514	"With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, ""I want something new."
514	I feel restless and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning more than
514	I am.  I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring
514	up, so as I can be spared this winter, I'd like to hop a little way and
514	"try my wings."""
514	""
514	"""Where will you hop?"""
514	""
514	"""To New York.  I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it.  You know"
514	Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her
514	children and sew.  It's rather hard to find just the thing, but I think
514	"I should suit if I tried."""
514	""
514	"""My dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!"" and Mrs."
514	March looked surprised, but not displeased.
514	""
514	"""It's not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is your"
514	friend--the kindest soul that ever lived--and would make things
514	pleasant for me, I know.  Her family is separate from the rest, and no
514	one knows me there.  Don't care if they do. It's honest work, and I'm
514	"not ashamed of it."""
514	""
514	"""Nor I.  But your writing?"""
514	""
514	"""All the better for the change.  I shall see and hear new things, get"
514	new ideas, and even if I haven't much time there, I shall bring home
514	"quantities of material for my rubbish."""
514	""
514	"""I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden"
514	"fancy?"""
514	""
514	"""No, Mother."""
514	""
514	"""May I know the others?"""
514	""
514	Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in
514	"her cheeks.  ""It may be vain and wrong to say it, but--I'm"
514	"afraid--Laurie is getting too fond of me."""
514	""
514	"""Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care"
514	"for you?"" and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the question."
514	""
514	"""Mercy, no!  I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely"
514	"proud of him, but as for anything more, it's out of the question."""
514	""
514	"""I'm glad of that, Jo."""
514	""
514	"""Why, please?"""
514	""
514	"""Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another.  As friends"
514	you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over, but I
514	fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much
514	alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong
514	wills, to get on happily together, in a relation which needs infinite
514	"patience and forbearance, as well as love."""
514	""
514	"""That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express it. I'm glad"
514	you think he is only beginning to care for me.  It would trouble me
514	sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love with the dear
514	"old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?"""
514	""
514	"""You are sure of his feeling for you?"""
514	""
514	The color deepened in Jo's cheeks as she answered, with the look of
514	mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking
514	"of first lovers, ""I'm afraid it is so, Mother.  He hasn't said"
514	anything, but he looks a great deal. I think I had better go away
514	"before it comes to anything."""
514	""
514	"""I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go."""
514	""
514	"Jo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, ""How Mrs. Moffat"
514	would wonder at your want of management, if she knew, and how she will
514	"rejoice that Annie may still hope."""
514	""
514	"""Ah, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is the"
514	same in all--the desire to see their children happy. Meg is so, and I
514	am content with her success.  You I leave to enjoy your liberty till
514	you tire of it, for only then will you find that there is something
514	sweeter.  Amy is my chief care now, but her good sense will help her.
514	For Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she may be well.  By the way,
514	she seems brighter this last day or two.  Have you spoken to her?'
514	""
514	"""Yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by-and-by."
514	"I said no more, for I think I know it,"" and Jo told her little story."
514	""
514	Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view of the
514	case, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that for Laurie's sake
514	Jo should go away for a time.
514	""
514	"""Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled, then I'll"
514	run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic. Beth must think
514	I'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't talk about Laurie to
514	her.  But she can pet and comfort him after I'm gone, and so cure him
514	of this romantic notion.  He's been through so many little trials of
514	"the sort, he's used to it, and will soon get over his lovelornity."""
514	""
514	Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear
514	that this 'little trial' would be harder than the others, and that
514	Laurie would not get over his 'lovelornity' as easily as heretofore.
514	""
514	The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon, for Mrs.
514	Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home for her.
514	The teaching would render her independent, and such leisure as she got
514	might be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society
514	would be both useful and agreeable.  Jo liked the prospect and was
514	eager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow for her
514	restless nature and adventurous spirit.  When all was settled, with
514	fear and trembling she told Laurie, but to her surprise he took it very
514	quietly.  He had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant, and
514	when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly,
514	"""So I am, and I mean this one shall stay turned."""
514	""
514	Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on
514	just then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart, for Beth
514	seemed more cheerful, and hoped she was doing the best for all.
514	""
514	"""One thing I leave in your especial care,"" she said, the night before"
514	she left.
514	""
514	"""You mean your papers?"" asked Beth."
514	""
514	"""No, my boy.  Be very good to him, won't you?"""
514	""
514	"""Of course I will, but I can't fill your place, and he'll miss you"
514	"sadly."""
514	""
514	"""It won't hurt him, so remember, I leave him in your charge, to plague,"
514	"pet, and keep in order."""
514	""
514	"""I'll do my best, for your sake,"" promised Beth, wondering why Jo"
514	looked at her so queerly.
514	""
514	"When Laurie said good-by, he whispered significantly, ""It won't do a"
514	bit of good, Jo.  My eye is on you, so mind what you do, or I'll come
514	"and bring you home."""

514	CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
514	""
514	JO'S JOURNAL
514	""
514	New York, November
514	""
514	Dear Marmee and Beth,
514	""
514	I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps to tell,
514	though I'm not a fine young lady traveling on the continent. When I
514	lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt a trifle blue, and might
514	have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four small
514	children, all crying more or less, hadn't diverted my mind, for I
514	amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time
514	they opened their mouths to roar.
514	""
514	Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared up
514	likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.
514	""
514	Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in that
514	big house full of strangers.  She gave me a funny little sky
514	parlor--all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table in a
514	sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like.  A fine view
514	and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and I took a
514	fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery, where I am to teach and sew,
514	is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke's private parlor, and the two little
514	girls are pretty children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me
514	after telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I've no doubt I shall make a
514	model governess.
514	""
514	I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the great
514	table, and for the present I do, for I am bashful, though no one will
514	believe it.
514	""
514	"""Now, my dear, make yourself at home,"" said Mrs. K.  in her motherly"
514	"way, ""I'm on the drive from morning to night, as you may suppose with"
514	such a family, but a great anxiety will be off my mind if I know the
514	children are safe with you.  My rooms are always open to you, and your
514	own shall be as comfortable as I can make it.  There are some pleasant
514	people in the house if you feel sociable, and your evenings are always
514	free.  Come to me if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can.
514	"There's the tea bell, I must run and change my cap.""  And off she"
514	bustled, leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.
514	""
514	As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked. The flights
514	are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting at the head of
514	the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up, I saw a gentleman
514	come along behind her, take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand,
514	carry it all the way up, put it down at a door near by, and walk away,
514	"saying, with a kind nod and a foreign accent, ""It goes better so.  The"
514	"little back is too young to haf such heaviness."""
514	""
514	Wasn't it good of him?  I like such things, for as Father says, trifles
514	show character.  When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that evening, she
514	"laughed, and said, ""That must have been Professor Bhaer, he's always"
514	"doing things of that sort."""
514	""
514	Mrs. K.  told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good, but poor as
514	a church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and two little
514	orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according to the wishes of
514	his sister, who married an American.  Not a very romantic story, but it
514	interested me, and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K.  lends him her
514	parlor for some of his scholars. There is a glass door between it and
514	the nursery, and I mean to peep at him, and then I'll tell you how he
514	looks.  He's almost forty, so it's no harm, Marmee.
514	""
514	After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I attacked the
514	big workbasket, and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend.  I
514	shall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week, so goodnight, and
514	more tomorrow.
514	""
514	Tuesday Eve
514	""
514	Had a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the children acted
514	like Sancho, and at one time I really thought I should shake them all
514	round.  Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics, and I kept it up
514	till they were glad to sit down and keep still.  After luncheon, the
514	girl took them out for a walk, and I went to my needlework like little
514	Mabel 'with a willing mind'.  I was thanking my stars that I'd learned
514	to make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut, and
514	someone began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like a big bumblebee. It was
514	dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn't resist the temptation, and
514	lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door, I peeped in.
514	Professor Bhaer was there, and while he arranged his books, I took a
514	good look at him.  A regular German--rather stout, with brown hair
514	tumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I
514	ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good, after our
514	sharp or slipshod American gabble.  His clothes were rusty, his hands
514	were large, and he hadn't a really handsome feature in his face, except
514	his beautiful teeth, yet I liked him, for he had a fine head, his linen
514	was very nice, and he looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were
514	off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe.  He looked sober in
514	spite of his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth
514	bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like an old
514	friend.  Then he smiled, and when a tap came at the door, called out in
514	"a loud, brisk tone, ""Herein!"""
514	""
514	I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a child
514	carrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going on.
514	""
514	"""Me wants me Bhaer,"" said the mite, slamming down her book and running"
514	to meet him.
514	""
514	"""Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer.  Come, then, and take a goot hug from him,"
514	"my Tina,"" said the Professor, catching her up with a laugh, and holding"
514	her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss
514	him.
514	""
514	"""Now me mus tuddy my lessin,"" went on the funny little thing.  So he"
514	put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she had brought,
514	and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled away, turning a leaf
514	now and then, and passing her little fat finger down the page, as if
514	finding a word, so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh,
514	while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look
514	that made me think she must be his own, though she looked more French
514	than German.
514	""
514	Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my
514	work, and there I virtuously remained through all the noise and
514	gabbling that went on next door.  One of the girls kept laughing
514	"affectedly, and saying, ""Now Professor,"" in a coquettish tone, and the"
514	other pronounced her German with an accent that must have made it hard
514	for him to keep sober.
514	""
514	Both seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once I heard him
514	"say emphatically, ""No, no, it is not so, you haf not attend to what I"
514	"say,"" and once there was a loud rap, as if he struck the table with his"
514	"book, followed by the despairing exclamation, ""Prut!  It all goes bad"
514	"this day."""
514	""
514	Poor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took just one
514	more peep to see if he survived it.  He seemed to have thrown himself
514	back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with his eyes shut till the
514	clock struck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if
514	ready for another lesson, and taking little Tina who had fallen asleep
514	on the sofa in his arms, he carried her quietly away.  I fancy he has a
514	hard life of it.  Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five
514	o'clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would,
514	just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me.  So I
514	made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as
514	she is short and I'm tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a
514	failure.  She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I
514	plucked up courage and looked about me.  The long table was full, and
514	every one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially, who
514	seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every sense of the
514	word, vanishing as soon as they were done.  There was the usual
514	assortment of young men absorbed in themselves, young couples absorbed
514	in each other, married ladies in their babies, and old gentlemen in
514	politics.  I don't think I shall care to have much to do with any of
514	them, except one sweetfaced maiden lady, who looks as if she had
514	something in her.
514	""
514	Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor, shouting
514	answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf old gentleman on
514	one side, and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other.  If Amy
514	had been here, she'd have turned her back on him forever because, sad
514	to relate, he had a great appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a
514	manner which would have horrified 'her ladyship'.  I didn't mind, for I
514	like 'to see folks eat with a relish', as Hannah says, and the poor man
514	must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.
514	""
514	As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were settling
514	their hats before the hall mirror, and I heard one say low to the
514	"other, ""Who's the new party?"""
514	""
514	"""Governess, or something of that sort."""
514	""
514	"""What the deuce is she at our table for?"""
514	""
514	"""Friend of the old lady's."""
514	""
514	"""Handsome head, but no style."""
514	""
514	"""Not a bit of it.  Give us a light and come on."""
514	""
514	I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care, for a governess is as
514	good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I haven't style, which is more
514	than some people have, judging from the remarks of the elegant beings
514	who clattered away, smoking like bad chimneys.  I hate ordinary people!
514	""
514	""
514	Thursday
514	""
514	Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing in my
514	little room, which is very cozy, with a light and fire.  I picked up a
514	few bits of news and was introduced to the Professor.  It seems that
514	Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the
514	laundry here.  The little thing has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and
514	follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home, which
514	delights him, as he is very fond of children, though a 'bacheldore'.
514	Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all
514	sorts of stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings,
514	and the splendid tales he tells.  The younger men quiz him, it seems,
514	call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner of
514	jokes on his name.  But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke says, and
514	takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him in spite of his
514	foreign ways.
514	""
514	The maiden lady is a Miss Norton, rich, cultivated, and kind.  She
514	spoke to me at dinner today (for I went to table again, it's such fun
514	to watch people), and asked me to come and see her at her room.  She
514	has fine books and pictures, knows interesting persons, and seems
514	friendly, so I shall make myself agreeable, for I do want to get into
514	good society, only it isn't the same sort that Amy likes.
514	""
514	I was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in with some
514	newspapers for Mrs. Kirke.  She wasn't there, but Minnie, who is a
514	"little old woman, introduced me very prettily. ""This is Mamma's friend,"
514	"Miss March."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, and she's jolly and we like her lots,"" added Kitty, who is an"
514	'enfant terrible'.
514	""
514	We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction and the
514	blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.
514	""
514	"""Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch.  If so"
514	"again, call at me and I come,"" he said, with a threatening frown that"
514	delighted the little wretches.
514	""
514	I promised I would, and he departed, but it seems as if I was doomed to
514	see a good deal of him, for today as I passed his door on my way out,
514	by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella.  It flew open, and
514	there he stood in his dressing gown, with a big blue sock on one hand
514	and a darning needle in the other.  He didn't seem at all ashamed of
514	it, for when I explained and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and
514	all, saying in his loud, cheerful way...
514	""
514	"""You haf a fine day to make your walk.  Bon voyage, Mademoiselle."""
514	""
514	I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, also to
514	think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes. The German
514	gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is another thing and not
514	so pretty.
514	""
514	""
514	Saturday
514	""
514	Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss Norton, who
514	has a room full of pretty things, and who was very charming, for she
514	showed me all her treasures, and asked me if I would sometimes go with
514	her to lectures and concerts, as her escort, if I enjoyed them.  She
514	put it as a favor, but I'm sure Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and
514	she does it out of kindness to me.  I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such
514	favors from such people don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.
514	""
514	When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor
514	that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his hands and knees,
514	with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a jump rope, and Minnie
514	feeding two small boys with seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in
514	cages built of chairs.
514	""
514	"""We are playing nargerie,"" explained Kitty."
514	""
514	"""Dis is mine effalunt!"" added Tina, holding on by the Professor's hair."
514	""
514	"""Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon, when"
514	"Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr. Bhaer?"" said Minnie."
514	""
514	The 'effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of them, and
514	"said soberly to me, ""I gif you my wort it is so, if we make too large a"
514	"noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we go more softly."""
514	""
514	I promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much
514	as they did, for a more glorious frolic I never witnessed.  They played
514	tag and soldiers, danced and sang, and when it began to grow dark they
514	all piled onto the sofa about the Professor, while he told charming
514	fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops, and the little
514	'koblods', who ride the snowflakes as they fall.  I wish Americans were
514	as simple and natural as Germans, don't you?
514	""
514	I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if motives of
514	economy didn't stop me, for though I've used thin paper and written
514	fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need.
514	Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can spare them.  My small news will
514	sound very flat after her splendors, but you will like them, I know.
514	Is Teddy studying so hard that he can't find time to write to his
514	friends?  Take good care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the
514	babies, and give heaps of love to everyone.  From your faithful Jo.
514	""
514	P.S.  On reading over my letter, it strikes me as rather Bhaery, but I
514	am always interested in odd people, and I really had nothing else to
514	write about.  Bless you!
514	""
514	DECEMBER
514	""
514	My Precious Betsey,
514	""
514	As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to you, for it
514	may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings on, for though
514	quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh, be joyful!  After what
514	Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the way of mental and moral
514	agriculture, my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend
514	as I could wish.  They are not so interesting to me as Tina and the
514	boys, but I do my duty by them, and they are fond of me.  Franz and
514	Emil are jolly little lads, quite after my own heart, for the mixture
514	of German and American spirit in them produces a constant state of
514	effervescence.  Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether spent in
514	the house or out, for on pleasant days they all go to walk, like a
514	seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep order, and then such
514	fun!
514	""
514	We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take lessons.  I really
514	couldn't help it, and it all came about in such a droll way that I must
514	tell you.  To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke called to me one day
514	as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room where she was rummaging.
514	""
514	"""Did you ever see such a den, my dear?  Just come and help me put these"
514	books to rights, for I've turned everything upside down, trying to
514	discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him not
514	"long ago."""
514	""
514	I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was 'a den' to
514	be sure.  Books and papers everywhere, a broken meerschaum, and an old
514	flute over the mantlepiece as if done with, a ragged bird without any
514	tail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white mice adorned the
514	other.  Half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the
514	manuscripts.  Dirty little boots stood drying before the fire, and
514	traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave of
514	himself, were to be seen all over the room.  After a grand rummage
514	three of the missing articles were found, one over the bird cage, one
514	covered with ink, and a third burned brown, having been used as a
514	holder.
514	""
514	"""Such a man!"" laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the relics in"
514	"the rag bag.  ""I suppose the others are torn up to rig ships, bandage"
514	cut fingers, or make kite tails.  It's dreadful, but I can't scold him.
514	He's so absent-minded and goodnatured, he lets those boys ride over him
514	roughshod.  I agreed to do his washing and mending, but he forgets to
514	give out his things and I forget to look them over, so he comes to a
514	"sad pass sometimes."""
514	""
514	"""Let me mend them,"" said I.  ""I don't mind it, and he needn't know."
514	I'd like to, he's so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending
514	"books."""
514	""
514	So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two pairs of the
514	socks, for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns.
514	Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it out, but one day last
514	week he caught me at it.  Hearing the lessons he gives to others has
514	interested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn, for Tina
514	runs in and out, leaving the door open, and I can hear.  I had been
514	sitting near this door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to
514	understand what he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am.
514	The girl had gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I
514	was busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most
514	absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer
514	looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray
514	him.
514	""
514	"""So!"" he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, ""you peep at me, I"
514	peep at you, and this is not bad, but see, I am not pleasanting when I
514	"say, haf you a wish for German?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, but you are too busy.  I am too stupid to learn,"" I blundered"
514	out, as red as a peony.
514	""
514	"""Prut!  We will make the time, and we fail not to find the sense.  At"
514	efening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness, for look you,
514	"Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay.""  And he pointed to my work 'Yes,'"
514	they say to one another, these so kind ladies, 'he is a stupid old
514	fellow, he will see not what we do, he will never observe that his sock
514	heels go not in holes any more, he will think his buttons grow out new
514	"when they fall, and believe that strings make theirselves.' ""Ah!  But I"
514	haf an eye, and I see much.  I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this.
514	Come, a little lesson then and now, or--no more good fairy works for me
514	"and mine."""
514	""
514	Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and as it really is a
514	splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began.  I took four
514	lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog.  The Professor was
514	very patient with me, but it must have been torment to him, and now and
514	then he'd look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it
514	was a toss-up with me whether to laugh or cry.  I tried both ways, and
514	when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe, he just threw
514	the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room. I felt myself
514	disgraced and deserted forever, but didn't blame him a particle, and
514	was scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and shake
514	myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if I'd covered
514	myself in glory.
514	""
514	"""Now we shall try a new way.  You and I will read these pleasant little"
514	_marchen_ together, and dig no more in that dry book, that goes in the
514	"corner for making us trouble."""
514	""
514	He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Anderson's fairy tales so
514	invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and went at my
514	lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely.
514	I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away (no other word will express
514	it) with all my might, tumbling over long words, pronouncing according
514	to inspiration of the minute, and doing my very best.  When I finished
514	reading my first page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and
514	"cried out in his hearty way, ""Das ist gut! Now we go well!  My turn.  I"
514	"do him in German, gif me your ear.""  And away he went, rumbling out the"
514	words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well
514	as hear.  Fortunately the story was _The Constant Tin Soldier_, which
514	is droll, you know, so I could laugh, and I did, though I didn't
514	understand half he read, for I couldn't help it, he was so earnest, I
514	so excited, and the whole thing so comical.
514	""
514	After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty well, for
514	this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the grammar gets
514	tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly.  I like
514	it very much, and he doesn't seem tired of it yet, which is very good
514	of him, isn't it?  I mean to give him something on Christmas, for I
514	dare not offer money. Tell me something nice, Marmee.
514	""
514	I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up smoking
514	and lets his hair grow.  You see Beth manages him better than I did.
514	I'm not jealous, dear, do your best, only don't make a saint of him.
514	I'm afraid I couldn't like him without a spice of human naughtiness.
514	Read him bits of my letters.  I haven't time to write much, and that
514	will do just as well.  Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable.
514	""
514	JANUARY
514	""
514	A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course
514	includes Mr. L.  and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can't tell you
514	how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn't get it till
514	night and had given up hoping.  Your letter came in the morning, but
514	you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was
514	disappointed, for I'd had a 'kind of feeling' that you wouldn't forget
514	me. I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after tea,
514	and when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I
514	just hugged it and pranced.  It was so homey and refreshing that I sat
514	down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in
514	my usual absurd way.  The things were just what I wanted, and all the
514	better for being made instead of bought.  Beth's new 'ink bib' was
514	capital, and Hannah's box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure.  I'll
514	be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully
514	the books Father has marked.  Thank you all, heaps and heaps!
514	""
514	Speaking of books reminds me that I'm getting rich in that line, for on
514	New Year's Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare. It is one he
514	values much, and I've often admired it, set up in the place of honor
514	with his German Bible, Plato, Homer, and Milton, so you may imagine how
514	I felt when he brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my own
514	"name in it, ""from my friend Friedrich Bhaer""."
514	""
514	"""You say often you wish a library.  Here I gif you one, for between"
514	these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one.  Read him well, and
514	he will help you much, for the study of character in this book will
514	"help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen."""
514	""
514	I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about 'my library', as
514	if I had a hundred books.  I never knew how much there was in
514	Shakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me.
514	Now don't laugh at his horrid name.  It isn't pronounced either Bear or
514	Beer, as people will say it, but something between the two, as only
514	Germans can give it. I'm glad you both like what I tell you about him,
514	and hope you will know him some day.  Mother would admire his warm
514	heart, Father his wise head.  I admire both, and feel rich in my new
514	'friend Friedrich Bhaer'.
514	""
514	Not having much money, or knowing what he'd like, I got several little
514	things, and put them about the room, where he would find them
514	unexpectedly.  They were useful, pretty, or funny, a new standish on
514	his table, a little vase for his flower, he always has one, or a bit of
514	green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he says, and a holder for his
514	blower, so that he needn't burn up what Amy calls 'mouchoirs'.  I made
514	it like those Beth invented, a big butterfly with a fat body, and black
514	and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took his fancy
514	immensely, and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue, so
514	it was rather a failure after all. Poor as he is, he didn't forget a
514	servant or a child in the house, and not a soul here, from the French
514	laundrywoman to Miss Norton forgot him.  I was so glad of that.
514	""
514	They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year's Eve.  I didn't
514	mean to go down, having no dress.  But at the last minute, Mrs. Kirke
514	remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me lace and
514	feathers.  So I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask
514	on.  No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and no one dreamed of
514	the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think I am very stiff and
514	cool, most of them, and so I am to whippersnappers) could dance and
514	dress, and burst out into a 'nice derangement of epitaphs, like an
514	allegory on the banks of the Nile'.  I enjoyed it very much, and when
514	we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me.  I heard one of the
514	young men tell another that he knew I'd been an actress, in fact, he
514	thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters.  Meg will
514	relish that joke.  Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania, a
514	perfect little fairy in his arms.  To see them dance was 'quite a
514	landscape', to use a Teddyism.
514	""
514	I had a very happy New Year, after all, and when I thought it over in
514	my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my many
514	failures, for I'm cheerful all the time now, work with a will, and take
514	more interest in other people than I used to, which is satisfactory.
514	Bless you all!  Ever your loving...  Jo

514	CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
514	""
514	FRIEND
514	""
514	Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy
514	with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the
514	effort, Jo still found time for literary labors.  The purpose which now
514	took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl,
514	but the means she took to gain her end were not the best.  She saw that
514	money conferred power, money and power, therefore, she resolved to
514	have, not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she loved
514	more than life.  The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth
514	everything she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her
514	bedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so
514	that she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years
514	Jo's most cherished castle in the air.
514	""
514	The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after
514	long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this delightful chateau en
514	Espagne.  But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for
514	public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on
514	bigger beanstalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed
514	awhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble and the
514	least lovely of the giant's treasures, if I remember rightly.  But the
514	'up again and take another' spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so
514	she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty, but
514	nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags.
514	""
514	She took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, even
514	all-perfect America read rubbish.  She told no one, but concocted a
514	'thrilling tale', and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor
514	of the Weekly Volcano.  She had never read Sartor Resartus, but she had
514	a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over
514	many than the worth of character or the magic of manners.  So she
514	dressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade herself that she
514	was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and
514	dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar
514	smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels
514	rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them
514	took the trouble to remove on her appearance.  Somewhat daunted by this
514	reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much
514	embarrassment...
514	""
514	"""Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office. I wished to"
514	"see Mr. Dashwood."""
514	""
514	Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman,
514	and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers, he advanced
514	with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep.  Feeling
514	that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her
514	manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,
514	blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the
514	occasion.
514	""
514	"""A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as an"
514	experiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more if this
514	"suits."""
514	""
514	While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,
514	and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers,
514	and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages.
514	""
514	"""Not a first attempt, I take it?"" observing that the pages were"
514	numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon--sure
514	sign of a novice.
514	""
514	"""No, sir.  She has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in"
514	"the _Blarneystone Banner_."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, did she?"" and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to"
514	take note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the
514	"buttons on her boots.  ""Well, you can leave it, if you like.  We've"
514	more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at
514	"present, but I'll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week."""
514	""
514	Now, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her at
514	all, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but
514	bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was
514	apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was
514	perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the
514	gentlemen that her little fiction of 'my friend' was considered a good
514	joke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as
514	he closed the door, completed her discomfiture.  Half resolving never
514	to return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching
514	pinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh
514	over the scene and long for next week.
514	""
514	When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced.  Mr.
514	Dashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable, and Mr.
514	Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his
514	manners, so the second interview was much more comfortable than the
514	first.
514	""
514	"""We'll take this (editors never say I), if you don't object to a few"
514	alterations.  It's too long, but omitting the passages I've marked will
514	"make it just the right length,"" he said, in a businesslike tone."
514	""
514	Jo hardly knew her own MS.  again, so crumpled and underscored were its
514	pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender parent might on being
514	asked to cut off her baby's legs in order that it might fit into a new
514	cradle, she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find
514	that all the moral reflections--which she had carefully put in as
514	ballast for much romance--had been stricken out.
514	""
514	"""But, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I"
514	"took care to have a few of my sinners repent."""
514	""
514	Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had
514	forgotten her 'friend', and spoken as only an author could.
514	""
514	"""People want to be amused, not preached at, you know.  Morals don't"
514	"sell nowadays.""  Which was not quite a correct statement, by the way."
514	""
514	"""You think it would do with these alterations, then?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language good, and so"
514	"on,"" was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply."
514	""
514	"""What do you--that is, what compensation--"" began Jo, not exactly"
514	knowing how to express herself.
514	""
514	"""Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this"
514	"sort.  Pay when it comes out,"" returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point"
514	had escaped him.  Such trifles do escape the editorial mind, it is said.
514	""
514	"""Very well, you can have it,"" said Jo, handing back the story with a"
514	satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five
514	seemed good pay.
514	""
514	"""Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better"
514	"than this?"" asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and"
514	emboldened by her success.
514	""
514	"""Well, we'll look at it.  Can't promise to take it.  Tell her to make"
514	it short and spicy, and never mind the moral.  What name would your
514	"friend like to put on it?"" in a careless tone."
514	""
514	"""None at all, if you please, she doesn't wish her name to appear and"
514	"has no nom de plume,"" said Jo, blushing in spite of herself."
514	""
514	"""Just as she likes, of course.  The tale will be out next week. Will"
514	"you call for the money, or shall I send it?"" asked Mr. Dashwood, who"
514	felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.
514	""
514	"""I'll call.  Good morning, Sir."""
514	""
514	As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful
514	"remark, ""Poor and proud, as usual, but she'll do."""
514	""
514	Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her
514	model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational
514	literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend,
514	she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.
514	""
514	Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and
514	scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared
514	upon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit
514	as could be expected.  Her readers were not particular about such
514	trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood
514	graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not
514	thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his
514	hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher
514	wages, had basely left him in the lurch.
514	""
514	She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew
514	stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the
514	mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed.  One
514	thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell
514	them at home.  She had a feeling that Father and Mother would not
514	approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon
514	afterward.  It was easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with
514	her stories.  Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but
514	promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.
514	""
514	She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write
514	nothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of
514	conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show
514	her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.
514	""
514	But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could
514	not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers,
514	history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and
514	lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose.  Jo soon found
514	that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the
514	tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business
514	light, she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic
514	energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them
514	original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers
514	for accidents, incidents, and crimes.  She excited the suspicions of
514	public librarians by asking for works on poisons.  She studied faces in
514	the street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her.
514	She delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old
514	that they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin,
514	and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed.  She thought
514	she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was beginning to
514	desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman's character.
514	She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its
514	influence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on
514	dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent
514	bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side
514	of life, which comes soon enough to all of us.
514	""
514	She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of
514	other people's passions and feelings set her to studying and
514	speculating about her own, a morbid amusement in which healthy young
514	minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own
514	punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got it.
514	""
514	I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read
514	character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,
514	brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every
514	perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who
514	interested her in spite of many human imperfections.  Mr. Bhaer, in one
514	of their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and
514	lovely characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a
514	writer.  Jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and
514	studied him--a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he
514	known it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.
514	""
514	Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first.  He was neither
514	rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called
514	fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as attractive as a
514	genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as
514	about a warm hearth.  He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving
514	something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer
514	young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face
514	looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his
514	sake.  Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and at last
514	decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle.  If he had
514	any sorrow, 'it sat with its head under its wing', and he turned only
514	his sunny side to the world.  There were lines upon his forehead, but
514	Time seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to
514	others.  The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many
514	friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and
514	his big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than
514	words.
514	""
514	His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the
514	wearer.  They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him
514	comfortable.  His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart
514	underneath.  His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets
514	plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full.
514	His very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy
514	like other people's.
514	""
514	"""That's it!"" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that"
514	genuine good will toward one's fellow men could beautify and dignify
514	even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner, darned his own
514	socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.
514	""
514	Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine
514	respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the
514	Professor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,
514	and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much
514	honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came
514	to see him. He never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss
514	Norton divulged the pleasing fact.  From her Jo learned it, and liked
514	it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it.  She felt proud
514	to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor
514	language-master in America, and his homely, hard-working life was much
514	beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it.
514	Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most
514	unexpected manner.  Miss Norton had the entree into most society, which
514	Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her.  The solitary woman
514	felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many
514	favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor.  She took them with
514	her one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several
514	celebrities.
514	""
514	Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had
514	worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off.  But her reverence for
514	genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to
514	recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and
514	women after all.  Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid
514	admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on
514	'spirit, fire, and dew', to behold him devouring his supper with an
514	ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance.  Turning as from a
514	fallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her
514	romantic illusions.  The great novelist vibrated between two decanters
514	with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly
514	with one of the Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at
514	another Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering
514	her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea
514	Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady
514	rendering speech impossible.  The scientific celebrities, forgetting
514	their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting
514	themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young
514	musician, who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked
514	horses; and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be
514	the most ordinary man of the party.
514	""
514	Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely disillusioned,
514	that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined
514	her, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the
514	philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an
514	intellectual tournament in the recess.  The conversations were miles
514	beyond Jo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel
514	were unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms,
514	and the only thing 'evolved from her inner consciousness' was a bad
514	headache after it was all over.  It dawned upon her gradually that the
514	world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and,
514	according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than before,
514	that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and
514	intellect was to be the only God.  Jo knew nothing about philosophy or
514	metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable,
514	half painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being
514	turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a
514	holiday.
514	""
514	She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him
514	looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.
514	He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated
514	just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat,
514	trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after
514	they had annihilated all the old beliefs.
514	""
514	Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions,
514	not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be
514	lightly spoken.  As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,
514	attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit
514	his brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul
514	would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over
514	that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.
514	""
514	He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for an
514	opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion
514	with all the eloquence of truth--an eloquence which made his broken
514	English musical and his plain face beautiful.  He had a hard fight, for
514	the wise men argued well, but he didn't know when he was beaten and
514	stood to his colors like a man.  Somehow, as he talked, the world got
514	right again to Jo.  The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed
514	better than the new.  God was not a blind force, and immortality was
514	not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact.  She felt as if she had solid
514	ground under her feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but
514	not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.
514	""
514	She did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave the Professor
514	her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out
514	then and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent.
514	She began to see that character is a better possession than money,
514	rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness is what a
514	wise man has defined it to be, 'truth, reverence, and good will', then
514	her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.
514	""
514	This belief strengthened daily.  She valued his esteem, she coveted his
514	respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just when the
514	wish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything.  It all grew
514	out of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo
514	her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put
514	there and he had forgotten to take off.
514	""
514	"""It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down,"" thought"
514	"Jo, with a smile, as he said ""Goot efening,"" and sat soberly down,"
514	quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his
514	headgear, for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.
514	""
514	She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,
514	hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover
514	it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a German
514	read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation.  After the reading
514	came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that
514	night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment.  The
514	Professor didn't know what to make of her, and stopped at last to ask
514	with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible. . .
514	""
514	"""Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no"
514	"respect for me, that you go on so bad?"""
514	""
514	"""How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat off?"""
514	said Jo.
514	""
514	Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt
514	and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then
514	threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.
514	""
514	"""Ah!  I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my"
514	cap.  Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not well,
514	"you too shall wear him."""
514	""
514	But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer
514	caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said with great
514	"disgust, ""I wish these papers did not come in the house.  They are not"
514	for children to see,  nor young people to read. It is not well, and I
514	"haf no patience with those who make this harm."""
514	""
514	Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a
514	lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper.  She did not like it, but
514	the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but
514	fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano.  It
514	was not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if
514	it had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no
514	name to betray her.  She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a
514	blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more
514	than people fancied.  He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among
514	the newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he
514	asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work.  Now it
514	occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it
514	"troubled him.  He did not say to himself, ""It is none of my business."
514	"I've no right to say anything,"" as many people would have done.  He"
514	only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from
514	mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help her with an
514	impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out
514	his hand to save a baby from a puddle.  All this flashed through his
514	mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by
514	the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready
514	to say quite naturally, but very gravely...
514	""
514	"""Yes, you are right to put it from you.  I do not think that good young"
514	girls should see such things.  They are made pleasant to some, but I
514	would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad
514	"trash."""
514	""
514	"""All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for"
514	it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people
514	"make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,"" said"
514	Jo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits
514	followed her pin.
514	""
514	"""There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to"
514	sell it.  If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would
514	not feel that the living was honest.  They haf no right to put poison
514	in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it.  No, they should think
514	"a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing."""
514	""
514	Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in
514	his hands.  Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for
514	her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and
514	gone harmlessly up the chimney.
514	""
514	"""I should like much to send all the rest after him,"" muttered the"
514	Professor, coming back with a relieved air.
514	""
514	Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her
514	hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.
514	"Then she thought consolingly to herself, ""Mine are not like that, they"
514	"are only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried,"" and taking up her"
514	"book, she said, with a studious face, ""Shall we go on, Sir? I'll be"
514	"very good and proper now."""
514	""
514	"""I shall hope so,"" was all he said, but he meant more than she"
514	imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the
514	words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.
514	""
514	As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully
514	reread every one of her stories.  Being a little shortsighted, Mr.
514	Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling
514	to see how they magnified the fine print of her book.  Now she seemed
514	to have on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also, for the
514	faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her
514	with dismay.
514	""
514	"""They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for each is"
514	more sensational than the last.  I've gone blindly on, hurting myself
514	and other people, for the sake of money.  I know it's so, for I can't
514	read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it,
514	and what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of
514	"them?"""
514	""
514	Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her
514	stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.
514	""
514	"""Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I'd better"
514	burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves
514	"up with my gunpowder,"" she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura"
514	whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.
514	""
514	But when nothing remained of all her three month's work except a heap
514	of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the
514	floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.
514	""
514	"""I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay for my"
514	"time,"" she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, ""I almost"
514	wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient.  If I didn't care
514	about doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I
514	should get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that Mother
514	"and Father hadn't been so particular about such things."""
514	""
514	Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that 'Father and Mother were
514	particular', and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians
514	to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to
514	impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build
514	character upon in womanhood.
514	""
514	Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not
514	pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as
514	is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs.
514	Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale
514	which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so
514	intensely moral was it.  She had her doubts about it from the
514	beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease
514	in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and
514	cumbrous costume of the last century.  She sent this didactic gem to
514	several markets, but it found no purchaser, and she was inclined to
514	agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn't sell.
514	""
514	Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed of
514	if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it.
514	The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try
514	juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to
514	convert all the world to his particular belief.  But much as she liked
514	to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty
514	boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did
514	not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants who did
514	go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to
514	escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons
514	on their lisping tongues.  So nothing came of these trials, and Jo
514	corked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility...
514	""
514	"""I don't know anything.  I'll wait until I do before I try again, and"
514	meantime, 'sweep mud in the street' if I can't do better, that's
514	"honest, at least.""  Which decision proved that her second tumble down"
514	the beanstalk had done her some good.
514	""
514	While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had
514	been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes looked
514	serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer.  He did
514	it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would
514	accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was
514	satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she
514	had given up writing.  Not only did he guess it by the fact that the
514	second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her
514	evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and
514	studied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on
514	occupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.
514	""
514	He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was
514	happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons
514	besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her
514	own life.
514	""
514	It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs.
514	Kirke till June.  Everyone seemed sorry when the time came.  The
514	children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up all
514	over his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.
514	""
514	"""Going home?  Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,"" he said,"
514	when she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner,
514	while she held a little levee on that last evening.
514	""
514	She was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight, and when
514	"his turn came, she said warmly, ""Now, Sir, you won't forget to come and"
514	see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I'll never forgive you if
514	"you do, for I want them all to know my friend."""
514	""
514	"""Do you?  Shall I come?"" he asked, looking down at her with an eager"
514	expression which she did not see.
514	""
514	"""Yes, come next month.  Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy"
514	"commencement as something new."""
514	""
514	"""That is your best friend, of whom you speak?"" he said in an altered"
514	tone.
514	""
514	"""Yes, my boy Teddy.  I'm very proud of him and should like you to see"
514	"him."""
514	""
514	Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure
514	in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr.
514	Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more
514	than a 'best friend', and simply because she particularly wished not to
514	look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush,
514	and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew.  If it had not been
514	for Tina on her knee.  She didn't know what would have become of her.
514	Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her
514	face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and
514	his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual
514	expression, as he said cordially...
514	""
514	"""I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much"
514	"success, and you all happiness.  Gott bless you!""  And with that, he"
514	shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.
514	""
514	But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with the
514	tired look on his face and the 'heimweh', or homesickness, lying heavy
514	at his heart.  Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat with the little
514	child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his head
514	on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search
514	of something that he could not find.
514	""
514	"""It is not for me, I must not hope it now,"" he said to himself, with a"
514	sigh that was almost a groan.  Then, as if reproaching himself for the
514	longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two tousled
514	heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened
514	his Plato.
514	""
514	He did his best and did it manfully, but I don't think he found that a
514	pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very
514	satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.
514	""
514	Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo off, and
514	thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory
514	of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to keep her
514	"company, and best of all, the happy thought, ""Well, the winter's gone,"
514	and I've written no books, earned no fortune, but I've made a friend
514	"worth having and I'll try to keep him all my life."""
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
514	""
514	HEARTACHE
514	""
514	Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose
514	that year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with
514	the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his
514	friends said.  They were all there, his grandfather--oh, so proud--Mr.
514	and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him
514	with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but
514	fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.
514	""
514	"""I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early"
514	"tomorrow.  You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?"" Laurie said, as he"
514	put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over.
514	He said 'girls', but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up
514	the old custom. She had not the heart to refuse her splendid,
514	successful boy anything, and answered warmly...
514	""
514	"""I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing 'Hail"
514	"the conquering hero comes' on a jew's-harp."""
514	""
514	Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic,
514	"""Oh, deary me!  I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do?"""
514	""
514	Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and
514	having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people were
514	going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her
514	answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy
514	wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings.  A call at
514	Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still
514	further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw a stalwart
514	figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about
514	and run away.
514	""
514	"""Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?"" cried Laurie, as soon as he was within"
514	speaking distance.
514	""
514	"""I forgot it."" And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not"
514	be called lover-like.
514	""
514	She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did not,
514	and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly
514	about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road
514	into the little path that led homeward through the grove.  Then he
514	walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and now
514	and then a dreadful pause occurred.  To rescue the conversation from
514	one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said
514	"hastily, ""Now you must have a good long holiday!"""
514	""
514	"""I intend to."""
514	""
514	Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him
514	looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded
514	"moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, ""No,"
514	"Teddy.  Please don't!"""
514	""
514	"""I will, and you must hear me.  It's no use, Jo, we've got to have it"
514	"out, and the sooner the better for both of us,"" he answered, getting"
514	flushed and excited all at once.
514	""
514	"""Say what you like then.  I'll listen,"" said Jo, with a desperate sort"
514	of patience.
514	""
514	Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to 'have it
514	out', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject with
514	characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that would get choky now
514	and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady...
514	""
514	"""I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help it, you've"
514	been so good to me.  I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me.
514	Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I can't go
514	"on so any longer."""
514	""
514	"""I wanted to save you this.  I thought you'd understand..."" began Jo,"
514	finding it a great deal harder than she expected.
514	""
514	"""I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they"
514	mean.  They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of his wits
514	"just for the fun of it,"" returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an"
514	undeniable fact.
514	""
514	"""I don't.  I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away"
514	"to keep you from it if I could."""
514	""
514	"""I thought so.  It was like you, but it was no use.  I only loved you"
514	all the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards
514	and everything you didn't like, and waited and never complained, for I
514	"hoped you'd love me, though I'm not half good enough..."" Here there was"
514	a choke that couldn't be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while
514	he cleared his 'confounded throat'.
514	""
514	"""You, you are, you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm so grateful"
514	to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't know why I can't love you
514	as you want me to.  I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, and it
514	"would be a lie to say I do when I don't."""
514	""
514	"""Really, truly, Jo?"""
514	""
514	He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with
514	a look that she did not soon forget.
514	""
514	"""Really, truly, dear."""
514	""
514	They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last words
514	fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as
514	if to go on, but for once in his life the fence was too much for him.
514	So he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still
514	that Jo was frightened.
514	""
514	"""Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it"
514	would do any good!  I wish you wouldn't take it so hard, I can't help
514	it.  You know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other
514	"people if they don't,"" cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she"
514	softly patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted
514	her so long ago.
514	""
514	"""They do sometimes,"" said a muffled voice from the post. ""I don't"
514	"believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try it,"" was"
514	the decided answer.
514	""
514	There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow
514	by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said
514	"very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, ""Laurie, I want"
514	"to tell you something."""
514	""
514	He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in
514	"a fierce tone, ""Don't tell me that, Jo, I can't bear it now!"""
514	""
514	"""Tell what?"" she asked, wondering at his violence."
514	""
514	"""That you love that old man."""
514	""
514	"""What old man?"" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather."
514	""
514	"""That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you"
514	"love him, I know I shall do something desperate;"" and he looked as if"
514	he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark
514	in his eyes.
514	""
514	Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she
514	"too, was getting excited with all this, ""Don't swear, Teddy!  He isn't"
514	old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend I've got,
514	next to you.  Pray, don't fly into a passion.  I want to be kind, but I
514	know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor.  I haven't the least
514	"idea of loving him or anybody else."""
514	""
514	"""But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?"""
514	""
514	"""You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this"
514	"trouble."""
514	""
514	"""I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo, Never!"
514	"Never!"" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words."
514	""
514	"""What shall I do with him?"" sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more"
514	"unmanagable than she expected.  ""You haven't heard what I wanted to"
514	tell you.  Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do right and make
514	"you happy,"" she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which"
514	proved that she knew nothing about love.
514	""
514	Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on
514	the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile,
514	and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was
514	not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part, for how
514	could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes
514	full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or
514	two her hardness of heart had wrung from him?  She gently turned his
514	head away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed
514	"to grow for her sake--how touching that was, to be sure! ""I agree with"
514	Mother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick
514	tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we
514	"were so foolish as to..."" Jo paused a little over the last word, but"
514	Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.
514	""
514	"""Marry--no we shouldn't!  If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect"
514	"saint, for you could make me anything you like."""
514	""
514	"""No, I can't.  I've tried and failed, and I won't risk our happiness by"
514	such a serious experiment.  We don't agree and we never shall, so we'll
514	"be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything rash."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, we will if we get the chance,"" muttered Laurie rebelliously."
514	""
514	"""Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,"" implored"
514	Jo, almost at her wit's end.
514	""
514	"""I won't be reasonable.  I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible"
514	view'.  It won't help me, and it only makes it harder.  I don't believe
514	"you've got any heart."""
514	""
514	"""I wish I hadn't."""
514	""
514	There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and thinking it a good omen,
514	Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he
514	said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously
514	"wheedlesome before, ""Don't disappoint us, dear!  Everyone expects it."
514	Grandpa has set his heart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get
514	"on without you.  Say you will, and let's be happy.  Do, do!"""
514	""
514	Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength
514	of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided
514	that she did not love her boy, and never could.  It was very hard to
514	do, but she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.
514	""
514	"""I can't say 'yes' truly, so I won't say it at all.  You'll see that"
514	"I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it..."" she began solemnly."
514	""
514	"""I'll be hanged if I do!"" and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning"
514	with indignation at the very idea.
514	""
514	"""Yes, you will!"" persisted Jo.  ""You'll get over this after a while,"
514	and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a
514	fine mistress for your fine house.  I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward
514	and odd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel--we
514	can't help it even now, you see--and I shouldn't like elegant society
514	and you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on
514	without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and
514	"everything would be horrid!"""
514	""
514	"""Anything more?"" asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to"
514	this prophetic burst.
514	""
514	"""Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry.  I'm"
514	happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it
514	"up for any mortal man."""
514	""
514	"""I know better!"" broke in Laurie.  ""You think so now, but there'll come"
514	a time when you will care for somebody, and you'll love him
514	tremendously, and live and die for him.  I know you will, it's your
514	"way, and I shall have to stand by and see it,"" and the despairing lover"
514	cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed
514	comical, if his face had not been so tragic.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love"
514	"him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!"" cried Jo,"
514	"losing patience with poor Teddy.  ""I've done my best, but you won't be"
514	reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't
514	give.  I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend,
514	but I'll never marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for
514	"both of us--so now!"""
514	""
514	That speech was like gunpowder.  Laurie looked at her a minute as if he
514	did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply away,
514	"saying in a desperate sort of tone, ""You'll be sorry some day, Jo."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, where are you going?"" she cried, for his face frightened her."
514	""
514	"""To the devil!"" was the consoling answer."
514	""
514	For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank
514	toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to send a
514	young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort
514	who are conquered by a single failure.  He had no thought of a
514	melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and
514	coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time
514	up the river than he had done in any race.  Jo drew a long breath and
514	unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip
514	the trouble which he carried in his heart.
514	""
514	"""That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent"
514	"state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him,"" she said, adding, as she"
514	went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing,
514	"and buried it under the leaves.  ""Now I must go and prepare Mr."
514	Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy.  I wish he'd love Beth,
514	perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her.
514	Oh dear!  How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?  I think
514	"it's dreadful."""
514	""
514	Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went
514	straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then
514	broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind
514	old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach.
514	He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving
514	Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better
514	than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and
514	resolved to carry his boy out of harm's way, for Young Impetuosity's
514	parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.
514	""
514	When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather
514	met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very
514	successfully for an hour or two.  But when they sat together in the
514	twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the
514	old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to
514	listen to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed
514	like love's labor lost.  He bore it as long as he could, then went to
514	his piano and began to play.  The windows were open, and Jo, walking
514	in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her
514	sister, for he played the '_Sonata Pathetique_', and played it as he
514	never did before.
514	""
514	"""That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one cry."
514	"Give us something gayer, lad,"" said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart"
514	was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew not how.
514	""
514	Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several
514	minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull
514	"Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling, ""Jo, dear, come in.  I"
514	"want you."""
514	""
514	Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he
514	listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord, and
514	the musician sat silent in the dark.
514	""
514	"""I can't stand this,"" muttered the old gentleman.  Up he got, groped"
514	his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad
514	"shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, ""I know, my boy, I know."""
514	""
514	"No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, ""Who told you?"""
514	""
514	"""Jo herself."""
514	""
514	"""Then there's an end of it!""  And he shook off his grandfather's hands"
514	with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his
514	man's pride could not bear a man's pity.
514	""
514	"""Not quite.  I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of"
514	"it,"" returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. ""You won't care to"
514	"stay at home now, perhaps?"""
514	""
514	"""I don't intend to run away from a girl.  Jo can't prevent my seeing"
514	"her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,"" interrupted Laurie"
514	in a defiant tone.
514	""
514	"""Not if you are the gentleman I think you.  I'm disappointed, but the"
514	girl can't help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to go away
514	"for a time.  Where will you go?"""
514	""
514	"""Anywhere.  I don't care what becomes of me,"" and Laurie got up with a"
514	reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather's ear.
514	""
514	"""Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake.  Why"
514	"not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?"""
514	""
514	"""I can't."""
514	""
514	"""But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got"
514	"through college."""
514	""
514	"""Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!"" and Laurie walked fast through the"
514	room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.
514	""
514	"""I don't ask you to go alone.  There's someone ready and glad to go"
514	"with you, anywhere in the world."""
514	""
514	"""Who, Sir?"" stopping to listen."
514	""
514	"""Myself."""
514	""
514	Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying
514	"huskily, ""I'm a selfish brute, but--you know--Grandfather--"""
514	""
514	"""Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all before,"
514	once in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy,
514	just sit quietly down and hear my plan.  It's all settled, and can be
514	"carried out at once,"" said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man,"
514	as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before
514	him.
514	""
514	"""Well, sir, what is it?"" and Laurie sat down, without a sign of"
514	interest in face or voice.
514	""
514	"""There is business in London that needs looking after.  I meant you"
514	should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things here
514	will get on very well with Brooke to manage them.  My partners do
514	almost everything, I'm merely holding on until you take my place, and
514	"can be off at any time."""
514	""
514	"""But you hate traveling, Sir.  I can't ask it of you at your age,"""
514	began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to
514	go alone, if he went at all.
514	""
514	The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to
514	prevent it, for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him
514	that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices.  So,
514	stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would
514	"leave behind him, he said stoutly, ""Bless your soul, I'm not"
514	superannuated yet.  I quite enjoy the idea.  It will do me good, and my
514	old bones won't suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as
514	"sitting in a chair."""
514	""
514	A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not easy,
514	"or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily, ""I"
514	don't mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I think you'd feel
514	happier than if I was left behind.  I don't intend to gad about with
514	you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in
514	my own way.  I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit
514	them.  Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you
514	will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your
514	"heart's content."""
514	""
514	Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the
514	world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain words which the
514	old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken
514	heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly
514	appeared in the howling wilderness.  He sighed, and then said, in a
514	"spiritless tone, ""Just as you like, Sir.  It doesn't matter where I go"
514	"or what I do."""
514	""
514	"""It does to me, remember that, my lad.  I give you entire liberty, but"
514	"I trust you to make an honest use of it.  Promise me that, Laurie."""
514	""
514	"""Anything you like, Sir."""
514	""
514	"""Good,"" thought the old gentleman.  ""You don't care now, but there'll"
514	come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I'm
514	"much mistaken."""
514	""
514	Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was
514	hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,
514	they were off.  During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore
514	himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases.  He was moody,
514	irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his appetite, neglected his dress
514	and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano, avoided
514	Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a
514	tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a
514	heavy sense of guilt by day.  Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of
514	his unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to
514	attempt consolation or offer sympathy.  On some accounts, this was a
514	relief to his friends, but the weeks before his departure were very
514	uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced that the 'poor, dear fellow was
514	going away to forget his trouble, and come home happy'.  Of course, he
514	smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad
514	superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was
514	unalterable.
514	""
514	When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain
514	inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves.  This
514	gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did
514	for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with
514	a whisper full of motherly solicitude.  Then feeling that he was going
514	very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the
514	afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life.  Jo followed a
514	minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round.  He did look
514	round, came back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above
514	him, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal
514	eloquent and pathetic.
514	""
514	"""Oh, Jo, can't you?"""
514	""
514	"""Teddy, dear, I wish I could!"""
514	""
514	That was all, except a little pause.  Then Laurie straightened himself
514	"up, said, ""It's all right, never mind,"" and went away without another"
514	word.  Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo did mind, for while the
514	curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as
514	if she had stabbed her dearest friend, and when he left her without a
514	look behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
514	""
514	BETH'S SECRET
514	""
514	When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in
514	Beth.  No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too
514	gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by
514	absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she
514	saw her sister's face. It was no paler and but littler thinner than in
514	the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if
514	the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining
514	through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty.  Jo saw
514	and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first
514	impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one
514	appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo
514	for a time forgot her fear.
514	""
514	But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety
514	returned and haunted her.  She had confessed her sins and been
514	forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip,
514	Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from
514	home.  Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and
514	as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took
514	Beth down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open
514	air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale
514	cheeks.
514	""
514	It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people
514	there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.
514	Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care
514	for anyone else.  So they were all in all to each other, and came and
514	went, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about
514	them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the
514	feeble one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long
514	separation was not far away.
514	""
514	They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between ourselves
514	and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is
514	very hard to overcome.  Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her
514	heart and Beth's, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there
514	seemed something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to
514	speak.  She wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not
514	seem to see what she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows
514	grew so plain to her, she said nothing of it to those at home,
514	believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better. She
514	wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth, and
514	what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when
514	she lay on the warm rocks with her head in Jo's lap, while the winds
514	blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet.
514	""
514	One day Beth told her.  Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still,
514	and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying
514	to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks.  But she
514	could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin,
514	and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells
514	they had been collecting. It came to her then more bitterly than ever
514	that Beth was slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively
514	tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a
514	minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth
514	was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for
514	"her to say, ""Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it.  I've tried to tell you,"
514	"but I couldn't."""
514	""
514	There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own, not even
514	tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry.  She was the weaker
514	then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about
514	her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.
514	""
514	"""I've known it for a good while, dear, and now I'm used to it, it isn't"
514	hard to think of or to bear.  Try to see it so and don't be troubled
514	"about me, because it's best, indeed it is."""
514	""
514	"""Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel"
514	"it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?"" asked Jo, refusing"
514	to see or say that it was best, but glad to know that Laurie had no
514	part in Beth's trouble.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I tried to"
514	think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble anyone.  But
514	when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, it was
514	hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,
514	"Jo."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and help you?"
514	"How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?"""
514	""
514	Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of
514	the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say
514	goodbye to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.
514	""
514	"""Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right.  I wasn't sure, no one"
514	said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken.  It would have been selfish
514	to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away,
514	"and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought so then."""
514	""
514	"""And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I"
514	"couldn't,"" cried Jo, glad to say all the truth."
514	""
514	Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain,
514	"and added softly, ""Then you didn't, dearie? I was afraid it was so, and"
514	"imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while."""
514	""
514	"""Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?"" asked Beth, as"
514	"innocently as a child.  ""I do love him dearly.  He is so good to me,"
514	how can I help It?  But he could never be anything to me but my
514	"brother.  I hope he truly will be, sometime."""
514	""
514	"""Not through me,"" said Jo decidedly.  ""Amy is left for him, and they"
514	would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such things, now.  I
514	"don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must get well."""
514	""
514	"""I want to, oh, so much!  I try, but every day I lose a little, and"
514	feel more sure that I shall never gain it back.  It's like the tide,
514	"Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped."""
514	""
514	"""It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too"
514	young, Beth.  I can't let you go.  I'll work and pray and fight against
514	it.  I'll keep you in spite of everything.  There must be ways, it
514	"can't be too late.  God won't be so cruel as to take you from me,"""
514	cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously
514	submissive than Beth's.
514	""
514	Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety.  It shows
514	itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than
514	homilies or protestations.  Beth could not reason upon or explain the
514	faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and
514	cheerfully wait for death.  Like a confiding child, she asked no
514	questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of
514	us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and
514	strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come.  She
514	did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her
514	passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love,
514	from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He
514	"draws us closer to Himself.  She could not say, ""I'm glad to go,"" for"
514	"life was very sweet for her.  She could only sob out, ""I try to be"
514	"willing,"" while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this"
514	great sorrow broke over them together.
514	""
514	"By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, ""You'll tell them this"
514	"when we go home?"""
514	""
514	"""I think they will see it without words,"" sighed Jo, for now it seemed"
514	to her that Beth changed every day.
514	""
514	"""Perhaps not.  I've heard that the people who love best are often"
514	blindest to such things.  If they don't see it, you will tell them for
514	me.  I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare them.  Meg
514	has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by Father
514	"and Mother, won't you Jo?"""
514	""
514	"""If I can.  But, Beth, I don't give up yet.  I'm going to believe that"
514	"it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true."" said Jo, trying"
514	to speak cheerfully.
514	""
514	"Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, ""I don't"
514	know how to express myself, and shouldn't try to anyone but you,
514	because I can't speak out except to my Jo.  I only mean to say that I
514	have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long.  I'm not
514	like the rest of you.  I never made any plans about what I'd do when I
514	grew up.  I never thought of being married, as you all did.  I couldn't
514	seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about
514	at home, of no use anywhere but there.  I never wanted to go away, and
514	the hard part now is the leaving you all.  I'm not afraid, but it seems
514	"as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven."""
514	""
514	Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound but the
514	sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide.  A white-winged gull flew
514	by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast.  Beth watched it
514	till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness.  A little
514	gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach 'peeping' softly to
514	itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea.  It came quite close to Beth,
514	and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone,
514	dressing its wet feathers, quite at home.  Beth smiled and felt
514	comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and
514	remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.
514	""
514	"""Dear little bird!  See, Jo, how tame it is.  I like peeps better than"
514	the gulls.  They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy,
514	confiding little things.  I used to call them my birds last summer, and
514	Mother said they reminded her of me--busy, quaker-colored creatures,
514	always near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song
514	of theirs.  You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm
514	and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.  Meg is the
514	turtledove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up
514	among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again.  Dear
514	little girl!  She's so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and
514	no matter how high she flies, she never will forget home.  I hope I
514	"shall see her again, but she seems so far away."""
514	""
514	"""She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to"
514	"see and enjoy her.  I'm going to have you well and rosy by that time,"""
514	began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change
514	was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought
514	aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.
514	""
514	"""Jo, dear, don't hope any more.  It won't do any good.  I'm sure of"
514	that.  We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait.
514	We'll have happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I think the tide
514	"will go out easily, if you help me."""
514	""
514	Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that silent kiss,
514	she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.
514	""
514	She was right.  There was no need of any words when they got home, for
514	Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from
514	seeing.  Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed, saying
514	how glad she was to be home, and when Jo went down, she found that she
514	would be spared the hard task of telling Beth's secret.  Her father
514	stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came
514	in, but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and Jo went
514	to comfort her without a word.
514	""

514	""
514	CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
514	""
514	NEW IMPRESSIONS
514	""
514	At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice
514	may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais--a charming place, for the
514	wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is
514	bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined
514	with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills.
514	Many nations are represented, many languages spoken, many costumes
514	worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a
514	carnival.  Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans, handsome
514	Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all
514	drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticizing
514	the latest celebrity who has arrived--Ristori or Dickens, Victor
514	Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands.  The equipages are as
514	varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the low
514	basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of
514	dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from
514	overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch
514	behind.
514	""
514	Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with
514	his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance.
514	He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the
514	independent air of an American--a combination which caused sundry pairs
514	of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in
514	black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange
514	flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy
514	him his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the
514	young man took little notice of them, except to glance now and then at
514	some blonde girl in blue.  Presently he strolled out of the promenade
514	and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and
514	listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the beach
514	toward Castle Hill.  The quick trot of ponies' feet made him look up,
514	as one of the little carriages, containing a single young lady, came
514	rapidly down the street.  The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in
514	blue.  He stared a minute, then his whole face woke up, and, waving his
514	hat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.
514	""
514	"""Oh, Laurie, is it really you?  I thought you'd never come!"" cried Amy,"
514	dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the great
514	scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's steps,
514	lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these
514	'mad English'.
514	""
514	"""I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you,"
514	"and here I am."""
514	""
514	"""How is your grandfather?  When did you come?  Where are you staying?"""
514	""
514	"""Very well--last night--at the Chauvain.  I called at your hotel, but"
514	"you were out."""
514	""
514	"""I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin!  Get in and we can"
514	talk at our ease.  I was going for a drive and longing for company.
514	"Flo's saving up for tonight."""
514	""
514	"""What happens then, a ball?"""
514	""
514	"""A Christmas party at our hotel.  There are many Americans there, and"
514	they give it in honor of the day.  You'll go with us, of course?  Aunt
514	"will be charmed."""
514	""
514	"""Thank you.  Where now?"" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his"
514	arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her
514	parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs afforded her
514	infinite satisfaction.
514	""
514	"""I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle Hill."
514	The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever
514	"been there?"""
514	""
514	"""Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it."""
514	""
514	"""Now tell me all about yourself.  The last I heard of you, your"
514	"grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where he has"
514	settled for the winter.  He has friends there and finds plenty to amuse
514	"him, so I go and come, and we get on capitally."""
514	""
514	"""That's a sociable arrangement,"" said Amy, missing something in"
514	Laurie's manner, though she couldn't tell what.
514	""
514	"""Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so we each"
514	suit ourselves, and there is no trouble.  I am often with him, and he
514	enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see
514	"me when I get back from my wanderings.  Dirty old hole, isn't it?"" he"
514	added, with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the
514	Place Napoleon in the old city.
514	""
514	"""The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind.  The river and the hills are"
514	delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my
514	delight.  Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass.  It's
514	"going to the Church of St.  John."""
514	""
514	While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their
514	canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some
514	brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt
514	a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could
514	not find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside
514	her.  He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she thought, but
514	now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired
514	and spiritless--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver
514	than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him.  She
514	couldn't understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she
514	shook her head and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away
514	across the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.
514	""
514	"""Que pensez-vous?"" she said, airing her French, which had improved in"
514	quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.
514	""
514	"""That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is"
514	"charming,"" replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on his heart and an"
514	admiring look.
514	""
514	She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy
514	her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he
514	promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was
514	'altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the
514	head.  She didn't like the new tone, for though not blase, it sounded
514	indifferent in spite of the look.
514	""
514	"""If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a boy,"" she"
514	thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying
514	meantime to seem quite easy and gay.
514	""
514	At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins
514	to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road
514	between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.
514	""
514	"""Beth is very poorly, Mother says.  I often think I ought to go home,"
514	but they all say 'stay'.  So I do, for I shall never have another
514	"chance like this,"" said Amy, looking sober over one page."
514	""
514	"""I think you are right, there.  You could do nothing at home, and it is"
514	a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and
514	"enjoying so much, my dear."""
514	""
514	He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he said
514	that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was lightened,
514	for the look, the act, the brotherly 'my dear', seemed to assure her
514	that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land.
514	Presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her
514	scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing
514	from her mouth the words, 'Genius burns!'.
514	""
514	Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket 'to keep it from
514	blowing away', and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read
514	him.
514	""
514	"""This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the"
514	"morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,"" said"
514	Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of
514	splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.
514	While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs
514	to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him,
514	with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had
514	wrought.  He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and
514	approve, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and
514	manner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of
514	that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call
514	elegance.  Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain aplomb
514	in both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman
514	of the world than she was, but her old petulance now and then showed
514	itself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness
514	was unspoiled by foreign polish.
514	""
514	Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks,
514	but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a
514	pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine,
514	which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh collar of her
514	cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure
514	in the pleasant scene.
514	""
514	As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved
514	her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing
514	"here and there, ""Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the"
514	fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa
514	Franca, Schubert's Tower, just below, and best of all, that speck far
514	"out to sea which they say is Corsica?"""
514	""
514	"""I remember.  It's not much changed,"" he answered without enthusiasm."
514	""
514	"""What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!"" said Amy,"
514	feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.
514	""
514	"""Yes,"" was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the"
514	island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting
514	in his sight.
514	""
514	"""Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what"
514	"you have been doing with yourself all this while,"" said Amy, seating"
514	herself, ready for a good talk.
514	""
514	But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered all her
514	questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the
514	Continent and been to Greece.  So after idling away an hour, they drove
514	home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left
514	them, promising to return in the evening.
514	""
514	It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night.
514	Time and absence had done its work on both the young people. She had
514	seen her old friend in a new light, not as 'our boy', but as a handsome
514	and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to
514	find favor in his sight.  Amy knew her good points, and made the most
514	of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and
514	pretty woman.
514	""
514	Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them
514	on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion of simple
514	dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh
514	flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were
514	both inexpensive and effective.  It must be confessed that the artist
514	sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique
514	coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear
514	heart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon
514	such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep
514	our hearts merry with their artless vanities.
514	""
514	"""I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,"" said"
514	Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball dress, and
514	covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white
514	shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair
514	she had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and
514	curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.
514	""
514	"""It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to make a"
514	"fright of myself,"" she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or"
514	braid, as the latest style commanded.
514	""
514	Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped
514	her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white
514	shoulders in delicate green vines.  Remembering the painted boots, she
514	surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and
514	chasseed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.
514	""
514	"""My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the"
514	real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. If I only
514	"had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,"" she said,"
514	surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.
514	""
514	In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as
514	she glided away.  She seldom ran--it did not suit her style, she
514	thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate
514	than the sportive or piquante.  She walked up and down the long saloon
514	while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the
514	chandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought
514	better of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed
514	of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one.  It so
514	happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came
514	in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant
514	window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress,
514	the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as
514	a well-placed statue.
514	""
514	"""Good evening, Diana!"" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she"
514	liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.
514	""
514	"""Good evening, Apollo!"" she answered, smiling back at him, for he too"
514	looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on
514	the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain
514	Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.
514	""
514	"""Here are your flowers.  I arranged them myself, remembering that you"
514	"didn't like what Hannah calls a 'sot-bookay',"" said Laurie, handing her"
514	a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily
514	passed it in Cardiglia's window.
514	""
514	"""How kind you are!"" she exclaimed gratefully.  ""If I'd known you were"
514	coming I'd have had something ready for you today, though not as pretty
514	"as this, I'm afraid."""
514	""
514	"""Thank you.  It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it,"" he"
514	added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.
514	""
514	"""Please don't."""
514	""
514	"""I thought you liked that sort of thing."""
514	""
514	"""Not from you, it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old bluntness"
514	"better."""
514	""
514	"""I'm glad of it,"" he answered, with a look of relief, then buttoned her"
514	gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to
514	do when they went to parties together at home.
514	""
514	The company assembled in the long salle a manger, that evening, was
514	such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent.  The hospitable
514	Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and having
514	no prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to their
514	Christmas ball.
514	""
514	A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk
514	with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black velvet with
514	a pearl bridle under her chin.  A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted
514	himself to the ladies, who pronounced him, 'a fascinating dear', and a
514	German Serene Something, having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely
514	about, seeking what he might devour.  Baron Rothschild's private
514	secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the
514	world, as if his master's name crowned him with a golden halo.  A stout
514	Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing,
514	and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little
514	family of eight.  Of course, there were many light-footed,
514	shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto,
514	and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles, likewise the usual set
514	of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while
514	mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly
514	when they danced with their daughters.
514	""
514	Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she 'took the
514	stage' that night, leaning on Laurie's arm.  She knew she looked well,
514	she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a
514	ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when
514	young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to
514	rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood.  She did pity the Davis
514	girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim
514	papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her
514	friendliest manner as she passed, which was good of her, as it
514	permitted them to see her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who
514	her distinguished-looking friend might be.  With the first burst of the
514	band, Amy's color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap
514	the floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know
514	it.  Therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than
514	"described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, ""Do you care to"
514	"dance?"""
514	""
514	"""One usually does at a ball."""
514	""
514	Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as
514	fast as possible.
514	""
514	"""I meant the first dance.  May I have the honor?"""
514	""
514	"""I can give you one if I put off the Count.  He dances divinely, but he"
514	"will excuse me, as you are an old friend,"" said Amy, hoping that the"
514	name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be
514	trifled with.
514	""
514	"""Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support..."
514	""
514	    A daughter of the gods,
514	"    Divinely tall, and most divinely fair,"""
514	""
514	was all the satisfaction she got, however.
514	""
514	The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy
514	was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling all the
514	while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish.  Laurie
514	resigned her to the 'nice little boy', and went to do his duty to Flo,
514	without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of
514	forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself
514	till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence. She
514	showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled
514	instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a glorious polka
514	redowa.  But his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when she
514	galloped away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with
514	an actual expression of relief.
514	""
514	That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a long
514	while, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between
514	the dances for a necessary pin or a moment's rest.  Her anger had a
514	good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed
514	unusually blithe and brilliant.  Laurie's eyes followed her with
514	pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit
514	and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be.  He very
514	naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view, and before
514	the evening was half over, had decided that 'little Amy was going to
514	make a very charming woman'.
514	""
514	It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took
514	possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,
514	hearts happy, and heels light.  The musicians fiddled, tooted, and
514	banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who
514	couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth.  The air was
514	dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young
514	giraffes.  The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor
514	with a dashing French-woman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin
514	train.  The serene Teuton found the supper-table and was happy, eating
514	steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the garcons by the
514	ravages he committed.  But the Emperor's friend covered himself with
514	glory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and
514	introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him.  The
514	boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold, for though he
514	'carried weight', he danced like an India-rubber ball.  He ran, he
514	flew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails
514	waved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the
514	music stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his
514	fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.
514	""
514	Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more
514	graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time
514	to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as
514	indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished
514	her, with assurances that he was 'desolated to leave so early', she was
514	ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.
514	""
514	It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections
514	find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young
514	blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the
514	enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion.  Laurie had a waked-up
514	look as he rose to give her his seat, and when he hurried away to bring
514	"her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, ""Ah, I"
514	"thought that would do him good!"""
514	""
514	"""You look like Balzac's '_Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme_',"" he said, as he"
514	fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other.
514	""
514	"""My rouge won't come off."" and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and"
514	showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh
514	outright.
514	""
514	"""What do you call this stuff?"" he asked, touching a fold of her dress"
514	that had blown over his knee.
514	""
514	"""Illusion."""
514	""
514	"""Good name for it.  It's very pretty--new thing, isn't it?"""
514	""
514	"""It's as old as the hills.  You have seen it on dozens of girls, and"
514	"you never found out that it was pretty till now--stupide!"""
514	""
514	"""I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, you see."""
514	""
514	"""None of that, it is forbidden.  I'd rather take coffee than"
514	"compliments just now.  No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous."""
514	""
514	Laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd
514	sort of pleasure in having 'little Amy' order him about, for she had
514	lost her shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him,
514	as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any
514	signs of subjection.
514	""
514	"""Where did you learn all this sort of thing?"" he asked with a quizzical"
514	look.
514	""
514	"""As 'this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would you kindly"
514	"explain?"" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but"
514	wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.
514	""
514	"""Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession,"
514	"the--the--illusion--you know"", laughed Laurie, breaking down and"
514	helping himself out of his quandary with the new word.
514	""
514	Amy was gratified, but of course didn't show it, and demurely answered,
514	"""Foreign life polishes one in spite of one's self.  I study as well as"
514	"play, and as for this""--with a little gesture toward her dress--""why,"
514	tulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, and I am used to making
514	"the most of my poor little things."""
514	""
514	Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn't in good
514	taste, but Laurie liked her better for it, and found himself both
514	admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of
514	opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers.
514	Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why he filled up
514	her book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the rest of
514	the evening in the most delightful manner; but the impulse that wrought
514	this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions
514	which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.

514	CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT
514	""
514	ON THE SHELF
514	""
514	In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married,
514	when 'Vive la liberte!' becomes their motto.  In America, as everyone
514	knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy
514	their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually
514	abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion
514	almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet.
514	Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as
514	soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim,
514	"as did a very pretty woman the other day, ""I'm as handsome as ever, but"
514	"no one takes any notice of me because I'm married."""
514	""
514	Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience
514	this affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little
514	world primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired
514	and beloved than ever.
514	""
514	As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very
514	strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter
514	exclusion of everything and everybody else.  Day and night she brooded
514	over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the
514	tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the
514	kitchen department.  Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the
514	wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored
514	his babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time,
514	supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored.
514	But three months passed, and there was no return of repose.  Meg looked
514	worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the
514	house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life 'aisy', kept
514	him on short commons.  When he went out in the morning he was
514	bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, if he came gaily
514	"in at night, eager to embrace his family, he was quenched by a ""Hush!"
514	"They are just asleep after worrying all day.""  If he proposed a little"
514	"amusement at home, ""No, it would disturb the babies.""  If he hinted at"
514	a lecture or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a
514	"decided--""Leave my children for pleasure, never!""  His sleep was broken"
514	by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to
514	and fro in the watches of the night.  His meals were interrupted by the
514	frequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped,
514	if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above.  And when he read his
514	paper of an evening, Demi's colic got into the shipping list and
514	Daisy's fall affected the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only
514	interested in domestic news.
514	""
514	The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of
514	his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual 'hushing' made
514	him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred
514	precincts of Babyland.  He bore it very patiently for six months, and
514	when no signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles
514	do--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere.  Scott had married and
514	gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running
514	over for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty,
514	and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end.  Mrs.
514	Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable,
514	and she performed her mission most successfully.  The parlor was always
514	bright and attractive, the chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty
514	of gay gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.
514	""
514	John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so
514	lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and
514	enjoyed his neighbor's society.
514	""
514	Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a
514	relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in
514	the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children.  But
514	by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep
514	at proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest, she began to miss John,
514	and find her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite
514	in his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the
514	fender.  She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured
514	because he did not know that she wanted him without being told,
514	entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain.
514	She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry, and in that
514	unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally
514	experience when domestic cares oppress them.  Want of exercise robs
514	them of cheerfulness, and too much devotion to that idol of American
514	women, the teapot, makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no
514	muscle.
514	""
514	"""Yes,"" she would say, looking in the glass, ""I'm getting old and ugly."
514	John doesn't find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded
514	wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances.
514	Well, the babies love me, they don't care if I am thin and pale and
514	haven't time to crimp my hair, they are my comfort, and some day John
514	"will see what I've gladly sacrificed for them, won't he, my precious?"""
514	""
514	To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a
514	crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel, which
514	soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as
514	politics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss
514	interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him.
514	Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one
514	day, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg's drooping
514	spirits had not escaped her observation.
514	""
514	"""I wouldn't tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really do need"
514	"advice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well be widowed,"""
514	replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's bib with an injured
514	air.
514	""
514	"""Goes on how, my dear?"" asked her mother anxiously."
514	""
514	"""He's away all day, and at night when I want to see him, he is"
514	continually going over to the Scotts'.  It isn't fair that I should
514	have the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish,
514	"even the best of them."""
514	""
514	"""So are women.  Don't blame John till you see where you are wrong"
514	"yourself."""
514	""
514	"""But it can't be right for him to neglect me."""
514	""
514	"""Don't you neglect him?"""
514	""
514	"""Why, Mother, I thought you'd take my part!"""
514	""
514	"""So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault is yours,"
514	"Meg."""
514	""
514	"""I don't see how."""
514	""
514	"""Let me show you.  Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you"
514	made it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only
514	"leisure time?"""
514	""
514	"""No, but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend."""
514	""
514	"""I think you could, dear, and I think you ought.  May I speak quite"
514	freely, and will you remember that it's Mother who blames as well as
514	"Mother who sympathizes?"""
514	""
514	"""Indeed I will!  Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often"
514	feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to
514	"me for everything."""
514	""
514	Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and with a little
514	interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly
514	together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than
514	ever.
514	""
514	"""You have only made the mistake that most young wives make--forgotten"
514	your duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very
514	natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be
514	remedied before you take to different ways, for children should draw
514	you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and
514	John had nothing to do but support them.  I've seen it for some weeks,
514	"but have not spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time."""
514	""
514	"""I'm afraid it won't.  If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm jealous,"
514	and I wouldn't insult him by such an idea.  He doesn't see that I want
514	"him, and I don't know how to tell him without words."""
514	""
514	"""Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away.  My dear, he's longing"
514	for his little home, but it isn't home without you, and you are always
514	"in the nursery."""
514	""
514	"""Oughtn't I to be there?"""
514	""
514	"""Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you"
514	are unfitted for everything.  Besides, you owe something to John as
514	well as to the babies.  Don't neglect husband for children, don't shut
514	him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it.  His place is
514	there as well as yours, and the children need him.  Let him feel that
514	he has a part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it
514	"will be better for you all."""
514	""
514	"""You really think so, Mother?"""
514	""
514	"""I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom give advice unless"
514	I've proved its practicability.  When you and Jo were little, I went on
514	just as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless I devoted
514	myself wholly to you.  Poor Father took to his books, after I had
514	refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone.  I
514	struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me.  I
514	nearly spoiled her by indulgence.  You were poorly, and I worried about
514	you till I fell sick myself.  Then Father came to the rescue, quietly
514	managed everything, and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake,
514	and never have been able to get on without him since.  That is the
514	secret of our home happiness.  He does not let business wean him from
514	the little cares and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let
514	domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits.  Each do our part
514	"alone in many things, but at home we work together, always."""
514	""
514	"""It is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband and"
514	children what you have been to yours.  Show me how, I'll do anything
514	"you say."""
514	""
514	"""You always were my docile daughter.  Well, dear, if I were you, I'd"
514	let John have more to do with the management of Demi, for the boy needs
514	training, and it's none too soon to begin. Then I'd do what I have
514	often proposed, let Hannah come and help you.  She is a capital nurse,
514	and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more
514	housework.  You need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and
514	John would find his wife again. Go out more, keep cheerful as well as
514	busy, for you are the sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get
514	dismal there is no fair weather.  Then I'd try to take an interest in
514	whatever John likes--talk with him, let him read to you, exchange
514	ideas, and help each other in that way.  Don't shut yourself up in a
514	bandbox because you are a woman, but understand what is going on, and
514	educate yourself to take your part in the world's work, for it all
514	"affects you and yours."""
514	""
514	"""John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid if I ask"
514	"questions about politics and things."""
514	""
514	"""I don't believe he would.  Love covers a multitude of sins, and of"
514	whom could you ask more freely than of him?  Try it, and see if he
514	"doesn't find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's suppers."""
514	""
514	"""I will.  Poor John!  I'm afraid I have neglected him sadly, but I"
514	"thought I was right, and he never said anything."""
514	""
514	"""He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn, I fancy."
514	This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow
514	apart, and the very time when they ought to be most together, for the
514	first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it.
514	And no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years
514	of the little lives given to them to train.  Don't let John be a
514	stranger to the babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and
514	happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else, and
514	through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should.
514	Now, dear, good-by.  Think over Mother's preachment, act upon it if it
514	"seems good, and God bless you all."""
514	""
514	Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the
514	first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it.  Of
514	course the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as
514	they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they
514	wanted.  Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not
514	so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by
514	an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi
514	inherited a trifle of his sire's firmness of character, we won't call
514	it obstinacy, and when he made up his little mind to have or to do
514	anything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change
514	that pertinacious little mind.  Mamma thought the dear too young to be
514	taught to conquer his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was
514	too soon to learn obedience.  So Master Demi early discovered that when
514	he undertook to 'wrastle' with 'Parpar', he always got the worst of it,
514	yet like the Englishman, baby respected the man who conquered him, and
514	"loved the father whose grave ""No, no,"" was more impressive than all"
514	Mamma's love pats.
514	""
514	A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social
514	evening with John, so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in
514	order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early,
514	that nothing should interfere with her experiment.  But unfortunately
514	Demi's most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that
514	night he decided to go on a rampage.  So poor Meg sang and rocked, told
514	stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she could devise, but all
514	in vain, the big eyes wouldn't shut, and long after Daisy had gone to
514	byelow, like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was, naughty
514	Demi lay staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake
514	expression of countenance.
514	""
514	"""Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and gives"
514	"poor Papa his tea?"" asked Meg, as the hall door softly closed, and the"
514	well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining room.
514	""
514	"""Me has tea!"" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel."
514	""
514	"""No, but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you'll go"
514	"bye-bye like Daisy.  Will you, lovey?"""
514	""
514	"""Iss!"" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the"
514	desired day.
514	""
514	Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran
514	down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow
514	in her hair which was his especial admiration.  He saw it at once and
514	"said with pleased surprise, ""Why, little mother, how gay we are"
514	"tonight.  Do you expect company?"""
514	""
514	"""Only you, dear."""
514	""
514	"""Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?"""
514	""
514	"""No, I'm tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change.  You always"
514	make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are, so why
514	"shouldn't I when I have the time?"""
514	""
514	"""I do it out of respect for you, my dear,"" said old-fashioned John."
514	""
514	"""Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,"" laughed Meg, looking young and pretty"
514	again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.
514	""
514	"""Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times.  This tastes"
514	"right.  I drink your health, dear."" and John sipped his tea with an air"
514	of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration however, for as
514	he put down his cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, and a little
514	voice was heard, saying impatiently...
514	""
514	"""Opy doy.  Me's tummin!"""
514	""
514	"""It's that naughty boy.  I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he"
514	"is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas,"""
514	said Meg, answering the call.
514	""
514	"""Mornin' now,"" announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, with his"
514	long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing
514	gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the 'cakies' with loving
514	glances.
514	""
514	"""No, it isn't morning yet.  You must go to bed, and not trouble poor"
514	"Mamma.  Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it."""
514	""
514	"""Me loves Parpar,"" said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal"
514	knee and revel in forbidden joys.  But John shook his head, and said to
514	Meg...
514	""
514	"""If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do"
514	"it, or he will never learn to mind you."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, of course.  Come, Demi,""  and Meg led her son away, feeling a"
514	strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her,
514	laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as
514	soon as they reached the nursery.
514	""
514	Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave him
514	a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more
514	promenades till morning.
514	""
514	"""Iss!"" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and"
514	regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.
514	""
514	Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when
514	the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies
514	"by boldly demanding, ""More sudar, Marmar."""
514	""
514	"""Now this won't do,"" said John, hardening his heart against the"
514	"engaging little sinner.  ""We shall never know any peace till that child"
514	learns to go to bed properly.  You have made a slave of yourself long
514	enough.  Give him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it.  Put
514	"him in his bed and leave him, Meg."""
514	""
514	"""He won't stay there, he never does unless I sit by him."""
514	""
514	"""I'll manage him.  Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as Mamma"
514	"bids you."""
514	""
514	"""S'ant!"" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted"
514	'cakie', and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.
514	""
514	"""You must never say that to Papa.  I shall carry you if you don't go"
514	"yourself."""
514	""
514	"""Go 'way, me don't love Parpar."" and Demi retired to his mother's"
514	skirts for protection.
514	""
514	But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to
514	"the enemy, with a ""Be gentle with him, John,"" which struck the culprit"
514	with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the judgment day was at
514	hand.  Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a
514	strong hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his
514	wrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the
514	way upstairs.  The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled
514	out on the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously
514	caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again, which
514	lively performance was kept up till the young man's strength gave out,
514	when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice.  This vocal
514	exercise usually conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post
514	which is popularly believed to be deaf.  No coaxing, no sugar, no
514	lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of
514	the fire enlivened the 'big dark' which Demi regarded with curiosity
514	rather than fear.  This new order of things disgusted him, and he
514	howled dismally for 'Marmar', as his angry passions subsided, and
514	recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat.
514	The plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg's
514	heart, and she ran up to say beseechingly...
514	""
514	"""Let me stay with him, he'll be good now, John."""
514	""
514	"""No, my dear.  I've told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him, and"
514	"he must, if I stay here all night."""
514	""
514	"""But he'll cry himself sick,"" pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for"
514	deserting her boy.
514	""
514	"""No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter"
514	is settled, for he will understand that he has got to mind.  Don't
514	"interfere, I'll manage him."""
514	""
514	"""He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by harshness."""
514	""
514	"""He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoiled by indulgence.  Go"
514	"down, my dear, and leave the boy to me."""
514	""
514	When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never
514	regretted her docility.
514	""
514	"""Please let me kiss him once, John?"""
514	""
514	"""Certainly.  Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and rest,"
514	"for she is very tired with taking care of you all day."""
514	""
514	Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for after it
514	was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom
514	of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.
514	""
514	"""Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying.  I'll cover him"
514	"up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest,"" thought John, creeping to"
514	the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.
514	""
514	But he wasn't, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's eyes
514	opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying
514	"with a penitent hiccough, ""Me's dood, now."""
514	""
514	Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which
514	followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible
514	accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest.  Demi
514	lay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a
514	subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's arm and
514	holding his father's finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered
514	with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby.  So held,
514	John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed
514	its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that
514	tussle with his son than with his whole day's work.
514	""
514	As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to
514	"herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, ""I"
514	never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies.  He does
514	know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is getting
514	"too much for me."""
514	""
514	When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful
514	wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a
514	bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the
514	election, if he was not too tired.  John saw in a minute that a
514	revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions,
514	knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn't
514	keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon
514	appear.  He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then
514	explained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply
514	interested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts from
514	wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet.  In
514	her secret soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as
514	mathematics, and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling
514	each other names, but she kept these feminine ideas to herself, and
514	when John paused, shook her head and said with what she thought
514	"diplomatic ambiguity, ""Well, I really don't see what we are coming to."""
514	""
514	John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty
514	little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it
514	with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.
514	""
514	"""She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and like"
514	"millinery for hers, that's only fair,"" thought John the Just, adding"
514	"aloud, ""That's very pretty.  Is it what you call a breakfast cap?"""
514	""
514	"""My dear man, it's a bonnet!   My very best go-to-concert-and-theater"
514	"bonnet."""
514	""
514	"""I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of"
514	"the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?"""
514	""
514	"""These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so,"""
514	and Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an
514	air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.
514	""
514	"""It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks"
514	"young and happy again,"" and John kissed the smiling face, to the great"
514	detriment of the rosebud under the chin.
514	""
514	"""I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new"
514	concerts some night.  I really need some music to put me in tune.  Will
514	"you, please?"""
514	""
514	"""Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like.  You"
514	have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall
514	"enjoy it, of all things.  What put it into your head, little mother?"""
514	""
514	"""Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous"
514	and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and
514	less care, so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I'm to see to
514	things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just
514	to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before
514	my time.  It's only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your
514	sake as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully lately,
514	and I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I can.  You don't
514	"object, I hope?"""
514	""
514	Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little
514	bonnet had from utter ruin.  All that we have any business to know is
514	that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which
514	gradually took place in the house and its inmates.  It was not all
514	Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the division of
514	labor system.  The children throve under the paternal rule, for
514	accurate, steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while
514	Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of
514	wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential
514	conversation with her sensible husband.  Home grew homelike again, and
514	John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him.  The Scotts
514	came to the Brookes' now, and everyone found the little house a
514	cheerful place, full of happiness, content, and family love.  Even
514	"Sallie Moffatt liked to go there.  ""It is always so quiet and pleasant"
514	"here, it does me good, Meg,"" she used to say, looking about her with"
514	wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use it
514	in her great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no
514	riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his own,
514	where there was no place for her.
514	""
514	This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had
514	found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to
514	use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual
514	helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy.
514	This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent
514	to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding
514	loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them,
514	undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking side by side, through
514	fair and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true
514	sense of the good old Saxon word, the 'house-band', and learning, as
514	Meg learned, that a woman's happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor
514	the art of ruling it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.

514	CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE
514	""
514	LAZY LAURENCE
514	""
514	Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month.  He
514	was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar presence seemed
514	to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a
514	part.  He rather missed the 'petting' he used to receive, and enjoyed a
514	taste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, from
514	strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls
514	at home.  Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very
514	glad to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the
514	representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she
514	would confess.  They naturally took comfort in each other's society and
514	were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice
514	no one can be very industrious during the gay season.  But, while
514	apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were
514	half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each
514	other.  Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in
514	hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken.  Amy tried to
514	please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he
514	gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly
514	women know how to lend an indescribable charm.  Laurie made no effort
514	of any kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as
514	possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind
514	word because one had been cold to him.  It cost him no effort to be
514	generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she
514	would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not
514	change the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the
514	keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful,
514	half-scornful surprise.
514	""
514	"""All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day.  I preferred to stay at"
514	home and write letters.  They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa
514	"to sketch, will you come?"" said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely"
514	day when he lounged in as usual, about noon.
514	""
514	"""Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?"" he answered"
514	slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.
514	""
514	"""I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so"
514	you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your gloves
514	"nice,"" returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids,"
514	which were a weak point with Laurie.
514	""
514	"""Then I'll go with pleasure."" and he put out his hand for her"
514	sketchbook.  But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...
514	""
514	"""Don't trouble yourself.  It's no exertion to me, but you don't look"
514	"equal to it."""
514	""
514	Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran
514	downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the reins
514	himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and
514	fall asleep on his perch.
514	""
514	The two never quarreled.  Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie
514	was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an
514	inquiring air.  She answered him with a smile, and they went on
514	together in the most amicable manner.
514	""
514	It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque
514	scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes.  Here an ancient monastery,
514	whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them.  There a
514	bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket
514	over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among
514	the rocks or lay at his feet.  Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with
514	panniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with a pretty girl in a
514	capaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with
514	a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the
514	quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on
514	the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky
514	foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones
514	fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the
514	Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.
514	""
514	Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer
514	roses blossomed everywhere.  They overhung the archway, thrust
514	themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to
514	passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and
514	feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where
514	seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool
514	grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every
514	fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to
514	smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped
514	the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of
514	the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean,
514	and the white-walled city on its shore.
514	""
514	"""This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it?  Did you ever see such"
514	"roses?"" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a"
514	luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.
514	""
514	"""No, nor felt such thorns,"" returned Laurie, with his thumb in his"
514	mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that
514	grew just beyond his reach.
514	""
514	"""Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,"" said Amy,"
514	gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall
514	behind her.  She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, and he
514	stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in
514	the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and
514	he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,
514	when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for
514	romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny
514	red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones
514	like that from the greenhouse at home.  The pale roses Amy gave him
514	were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal
514	wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for
514	himself, but the next instant his American common sense got the better
514	of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard
514	since he came.
514	""
514	"""It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers,"" she"
514	said, thinking her speech amused him.
514	""
514	"""Thank you, I will,"" he answered in jest, and a few months later he did"
514	it in earnest.
514	""
514	"""Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?"" she asked presently,"
514	as she settled herself on a rustic seat.
514	""
514	"""Very soon."""
514	""
514	"""You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks."""
514	""
514	"""I dare say, short answers save trouble."""
514	""
514	"""He expects you, and you really ought to go."""
514	""
514	"""Hospitable creature!  I know it."""
514	""
514	"""Then why don't you do it?"""
514	""
514	"""Natural depravity, I suppose."""
514	""
514	"""Natural indolence, you mean.  It's really dreadful!"" and Amy looked"
514	severe.
514	""
514	"""Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I"
514	might as well stay and plague you a little longer, you can bear it
514	"better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently,"" and Laurie"
514	composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.
514	""
514	Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of
514	resignation, but she had made up her mind to lecture 'that boy' and in
514	a minute she began again.
514	""
514	"""What are you doing just now?"""
514	""
514	"""Watching lizards."""
514	""
514	"""No, no.  I mean what do you intend and wish to do?"""
514	""
514	"""Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me."""
514	""
514	"""How provoking you are!  I don't approve of cigars and I will only"
514	allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch.  I need a
514	"figure."""
514	""
514	"""With all the pleasure in life.  How will you have me, full length or"
514	three-quarters, on my head or my heels?  I should respectfully suggest
514	a recumbent posture, then put yourself in also and call it 'Dolce far
514	"niente'."""
514	""
514	"""Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like.  I intend to work hard,"""
514	said Amy in her most energetic tone.
514	""
514	"""What delightful enthusiasm!"" and he leaned against a tall urn with an"
514	air of entire satisfaction.
514	""
514	"""What would Jo say if she saw you now?"" asked Amy impatiently, hoping"
514	to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name.
514	""
514	"""As usual, 'Go away, Teddy.  I'm busy!'"" He laughed as he spoke, but"
514	the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the
514	utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed
514	yet.  Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them
514	before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on
514	Laurie's face--a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and
514	regret.  It was gone before she could study it and the listless
514	expression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic
514	pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in
514	the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for
514	he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.
514	""
514	"""You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,"" she"
514	said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark
514	stone.
514	""
514	"""Wish I was!"""
514	""
514	"""That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so"
514	"changed, I sometimes think--"" there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,"
514	half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.
514	""
514	Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated
514	to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used
514	"to say it to her mother, ""It's all right, ma'am."""
514	""
514	That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry
514	her lately.  It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the
514	cordial tone in which she said...
514	""
514	"""I'm glad of that!  I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I"
514	fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost
514	your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into
514	some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of
514	a foreign tour.  Don't stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the
514	grass here and 'let us be friendly', as Jo used to say when we got in
514	"the sofa corner and told secrets."""
514	""
514	Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse
514	himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay
514	there.
514	""
514	"""I'm all ready for the secrets."" and he glanced up with a decided"
514	expression of interest in his eyes.
514	""
514	"""I've none to tell.  You may begin."""
514	""
514	"""Haven't one to bless myself with.  I thought perhaps you'd had some"
514	"news from home.."""
514	""
514	"""You have heard all that has come lately.  Don't you hear often?  I"
514	"fancied Jo would send you volumes."""
514	""
514	"""She's very busy.  I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular,"
514	"you know.  When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?"" he"
514	asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he
514	had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it.
514	""
514	"""Never,"" she answered, with a despondent but decided air. ""Rome took"
514	all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there, I felt
514	"too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair."""
514	""
514	"""Why should you, with so much energy and talent?"""
514	""
514	"""That's just why, because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy"
514	can make it so.  I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a
514	"common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more."""
514	""
514	"""And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?"""
514	""
514	"""Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get"
514	"the chance."""
514	""
514	It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity
514	becomes young people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation.  Laurie
514	smiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose
514	when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.
514	""
514	"""Good!  And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy."""
514	""
514	Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her
514	"downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, ""Now I'm going"
514	"to play brother, and ask questions.  May I?"""
514	""
514	"""I don't promise to answer."""
514	""
514	"""Your face will, if your tongue won't.  You aren't woman of the world"
514	enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear.  I heard rumors about Fred
514	and you last year, and it's my private opinion that if he had not been
514	called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come
514	"of it, hey?"""
514	""
514	"""That's not for me to say,"" was Amy's grim reply, but her lips would"
514	smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed
514	that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.
514	""
514	"""You are not engaged, I hope?"" and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly"
514	and grave all of a sudden.
514	""
514	"""No."""
514	""
514	"""But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees,"
514	"won't you?"""
514	""
514	"""Very likely."""
514	""
514	"""Then you are fond of old Fred?"""
514	""
514	"""I could be, if I tried."""
514	""
514	"""But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul,"
514	what unearthly prudence!  He's a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I
514	"fancied you'd like."""
514	""
514	"""He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,"" began Amy,"
514	trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of
514	herself, in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.
514	""
514	"""I understand.  Queens of society can't get on without money, so you"
514	mean to make a good match, and start in that way?  Quite right and
514	proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of
514	"your mother's girls."""
514	""
514	"""True, nevertheless."""
514	""
514	A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered
514	contrasted curiously with the young speaker.  Laurie felt this
514	instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of
514	disappointment which he could not explain.  His look and silence, as
514	well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her
514	resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.
514	""
514	"""I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,"" she said"
514	sharply.
514	""
514	"""Do it for me, there's a dear girl."""
514	""
514	"""I could, if I tried."" and she looked as if she would like doing it in"
514	the most summary style.
514	""
514	"""Try, then.  I give you leave,"" returned Laurie, who enjoyed having"
514	someone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.
514	""
514	"""You'd be angry in five minutes."""
514	""
514	"""I'm never angry with you.  It takes two flints to make a fire. You are"
514	"as cool and soft as snow."""
514	""
514	"""You don't know what I can do.  Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if"
514	applied rightly.  Your indifference is half affectation, and a good
514	"stirring up would prove it."""
514	""
514	"""Stir away, it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said"
514	when his little wife beat him.  Regard me in the light of a husband or
514	a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees
514	"with you."""
514	""
514	Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the
514	apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and
514	began.
514	""
514	"""Flo and I have got a new name for you.  It's Lazy Laurence. How do you"
514	"like it?"""
514	""
514	She thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his arms under his
514	"head, with an imperturbable, ""That's not bad. Thank you, ladies."""
514	""
514	"""Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?"""
514	""
514	"""Pining to be told."""
514	""
514	"""Well, I despise you."""
514	""
514	If she had even said 'I hate you' in a petulant or coquettish tone, he
514	would have laughed and rather liked it, but the grave, almost sad,
514	accent in her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly...
514	""
514	"""Why, if you please?"""
514	""
514	"""Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are"
514	"faulty, lazy, and miserable."""
514	""
514	"""Strong language, mademoiselle."""
514	""
514	"""If you like it, I'll go on."""
514	""
514	"""Pray do, it's quite interesting."""
514	""
514	"""I thought you'd find it so.  Selfish people always like to talk about"
514	"themselves."""
514	""
514	"""Am I selfish?"" the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of"
514	surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity.
514	""
514	"""Yes, very selfish,"" continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as"
514	"effective just then as an angry one.  ""I'll show you how, for I've"
514	studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm not at all satisfied with
514	you.  Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing but
514	"waste time and money and disappoint your friends."""
514	""
514	"""Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?"""
514	""
514	"""You don't look as if you'd had much.  At any rate, you are none the"
514	better for it, as far as I can see.  I said when we first met that you
514	had improved.  Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so
514	nice as when I left you at home.  You have grown abominably lazy, you
514	like gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to
514	be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and
514	respected by wise ones.  With money, talent, position, health, and
514	beauty, ah you like that old Vanity!  But it's the truth, so I can't
514	help saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you
514	can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you
514	"ought to be, you are only...""  there she stopped, with a look that had"
514	both pain and pity in it.
514	""
514	"""Saint Laurence on a gridiron,"" added Laurie, blandly finishing the"
514	sentence.  But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a
514	wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured
514	expression replaced the former indifference.
514	""
514	"""I supposed you'd take it so.  You men tell us we are angels, and say"
514	we can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly try to do you
514	good, you laugh at us and won't listen, which proves how much your
514	"flattery is worth."" Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the"
514	exasperating martyr at her feet.
514	""
514	In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw,
514	"and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child, ""I"
514	"will be good, oh, I will be good!"""
514	""
514	But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the
514	"outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, ""Aren't you ashamed of a"
514	hand like that?  It's as soft and white as a woman's, and looks as if
514	it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best gloves and pick flowers
514	for ladies.  You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I'm glad to see
514	there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little old one
514	"Jo gave you so long ago.  Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me!"""
514	""
514	"""So do I!"""
514	""
514	The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough
514	in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy.  She glanced down at him with
514	a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his hat half over his
514	face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth.  She only saw
514	his chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a
514	sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as
514	if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in
514	a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in
514	Amy's mind, and told her what her sister never had confided to her.
514	She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled
514	the shadow on his face just now, the change in his character, and the
514	wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome
514	hand.  Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence.
514	Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the
514	alteration, and now she was sure of it.  Her keen eyes filled, and when
514	she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and
514	kind when she chose to make it so.
514	""
514	"""I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren't"
514	the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very angry with me.
514	But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't bear to think they
514	should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps
514	"they would understand the change better than I do."""
514	""
514	"""I think they would,"" came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as"
514	touching as a broken one.
514	""
514	"""They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,"
514	when I should have been more kind and patient than ever.  I never did
514	"like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!"" said artful Amy, wishing to"
514	be sure of her facts this time.
514	""
514	"""Hang Miss Randal!"" and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look"
514	that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.
514	""
514	"""I beg pardon, I thought..."" and there she paused diplomatically."
514	""
514	"""No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but"
514	"Jo,"" Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face"
514	away as he spoke.
514	""
514	"""I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came"
514	away, I supposed I was mistaken.  And Jo wouldn't be kind to you?  Why,
514	"I was sure she loved you dearly."""
514	""
514	"""She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for her she"
514	didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me.  It's
514	"her fault though, and you may tell her so."""
514	""
514	The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled
514	Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.
514	""
514	"""I was wrong, I didn't know.  I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I"
514	"can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear."""
514	""
514	"""Don't, that's her name for me!"" and Laurie put up his hand with a"
514	quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind,
514	"half-reproachful tone.  ""Wait till you've tried it yourself,"" he added"
514	in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.
514	""
514	"""I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved,"" said"
514	Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.
514	""
514	Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well,
514	making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live
514	it down alone.  Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for
514	the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first
514	failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference.  He felt as if
514	suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to
514	"sleep again.  Presently he sat up and asked slowly, ""Do you think Jo"
514	"would despise me as you do?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, if she saw you now.  She hates lazy people.  Why don't you do"
514	"something splendid, and make her love you?"""
514	""
514	"""I did my best, but it was no use."""
514	""
514	"""Graduating well, you mean?  That was no more than you ought to have"
514	done, for your grandfather's sake.  It would have been shameful to fail
514	after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew that you
514	"could do well."""
514	""
514	"""I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,"" began Laurie,"
514	leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.
514	""
514	"""No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and"
514	proved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set
514	about another task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self
514	"again, and forget your trouble."""
514	""
514	"""That's impossible."""
514	""
514	"""Try it and see.  You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, 'Much"
514	she knows about such things'.  I don't pretend to be wise, but I am
514	observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine.  I'm
514	interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and
514	though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.
514	Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for
514	it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the
514	one you want.  There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake
514	"up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl."""
514	""
514	Neither spoke for several minutes.  Laurie sat turning the little ring
514	on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had
514	been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,
514	"merely saying, ""How do you like that?"""
514	""
514	He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it
514	was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless
514	face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the
514	little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head.
514	""
514	"""How well you draw!"" he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at"
514	"her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, ""Yes, that's me."""
514	""
514	"""As you are.  This is as you were."" and Amy laid another sketch beside"
514	the one he held.
514	""
514	It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it
514	which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that
514	a sudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked.  Only a
514	rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse.  Hat and coat were off, and
514	every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude
514	was full of energy and meaning.  The handsome brute, just subdued,
514	stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot
514	impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for
514	the voice that had mastered him.  In the ruffled mane, the rider's
514	breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly
514	arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that
514	contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the '_Dolce far Niente_'
514	sketch.  Laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other,
514	Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and
514	accepted the little lesson she had given him.  That satisfied her, and
514	without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way...
514	""
514	"""Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all"
514	looked on?  Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced,
514	and I sat on the fence and drew you.  I found that sketch in my
514	"portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you."""
514	""
514	"""Much obliged.  You've improved immensely since then, and I"
514	congratulate you.  May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon paradise'
514	"that five o'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?"""
514	""
514	Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow
514	and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures
514	should have an end.  He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent
514	air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more
514	effacious than he would confess.  Amy felt the shade of coldness in his
514	manner, and said to herself...
514	""
514	"""Now, I've offended him.  Well, if it does him good, I'm glad, if it"
514	makes him hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and I can't take back a
514	"word of it."""
514	""
514	They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up
514	behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming
514	spirits.  But both felt ill at ease.  The friendly frankness was
514	disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their
514	apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each.
514	""
514	"""Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?"" asked Amy, as they parted"
514	at her aunt's door.
514	""
514	"""Unfortunately I have an engagement.  Au revoir, madamoiselle,"" and"
514	Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which
514	became him better than many men.  Something in his face made Amy say
514	quickly and warmly...
514	""
514	"""No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd"
514	rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental
514	"salutations in France."""
514	""
514	"""Goodbye, dear,"" and with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,"
514	Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.
514	""
514	Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made
514	her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.
514	""
514	My Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within
514	yourself, for 'Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like the best of
514	boys.  A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful
514	honeymoon at Valrosa!  I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser.
514	Tell him so, with my congratulations.
514	""
514	Yours gratefully, Telemachus
514	""
514	""
514	"""Good boy!  I'm glad he's gone,"" said Amy, with an approving smile. The"
514	next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding,
514	"with an involuntary sigh, ""Yes, I am glad, but how I shall miss him."""

514	CHAPTER FORTY
514	""
514	THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW
514	""
514	When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,
514	and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased
514	affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of
514	trouble.  They put away their grief, and each did his or her part
514	toward making that last year a happy one.
514	""
514	The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was
514	gathered everything that she most loved, flowers, pictures, her piano,
514	the little worktable, and the beloved pussies.  Father's best books
514	found their way there, Mother's easy chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest
514	sketches, and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,
514	to make sunshine for Aunty Beth.  John quietly set apart a little sum,
514	that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with
514	the fruit she loved and longed for.  Old Hannah never wearied of
514	concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears
514	as she worked, and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful
514	letters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands
514	that know no winter.
514	""
514	Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth,
514	tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet,
514	unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to
514	make it happier for those who should remain behind.  The feeble fingers
514	were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things for
514	the school children daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens
514	from her window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small
514	mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through
514	forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and all manner
514	of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of
514	learning found their way strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to
514	regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above
514	there, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and
514	needs.  If Beth had wanted any reward, she found it in the bright
514	little faces always turned up to her window, with nods and smiles, and
514	the droll little letters which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.
514	""
514	The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look
514	"round, and say ""How beautiful this is!"" as they all sat together in her"
514	sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and
514	sisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from
514	the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as
514	applicable now as when written centuries ago, a little chapel, where a
514	paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn,
514	trying to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make
514	resignation possible.  Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls
514	of those who listened, for the father's heart was in the minister's
514	religion, and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence
514	to the words he spoke or read.
514	""
514	It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as
514	preparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the
514	needle was 'so heavy', and put it down forever.  Talking wearied her,
514	faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil
514	spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble
514	flesh.  Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching
514	hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced
514	to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the
514	"bitter cry, ""Help me, help me!"" and to feel that there was no help.  A"
514	sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with
514	death, but both were mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion
514	over, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever.  With the wreck
514	of her frail body, Beth's soul grew strong, and though she said little,
514	those about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim
514	called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,
514	trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed
514	the river.
514	""
514	"Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said ""I feel stronger when"
514	"you are here.""  She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew"
514	the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom
514	asked for anything, and 'tried not to be a trouble'.  All day she
514	haunted the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being
514	chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her.  Precious and
514	helpful hours to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it
514	needed.  Lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could
514	not fail to learn them, charity for all, the lovely spirit that can
514	forgive and truly forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the
514	hardest easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts
514	undoubtingly.
514	""
514	Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book,
514	heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her
514	lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the
514	transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too
514	deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was
514	trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the
514	life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music
514	she loved so well.
514	""
514	Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest
514	hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter.  For with
514	eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest
514	sorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life--uneventful,
514	unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which 'smell sweet, and
514	blossom in the dust', the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on
514	earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible
514	to all.
514	""
514	One night when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find
514	something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as
514	hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite,
514	Pilgrims's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo's
514	hand.  The name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made
514	her sure that tears had fallen on it.
514	""
514	"""Poor Jo!  She's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave.  She"
514	shows me all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I look at
514	"this"", thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug,"
514	with the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell
514	apart.
514	""
514	    MY BETH
514	""
514	    Sitting patient in the shadow
514	    Till the blessed light shall come,
514	    A serene and saintly presence
514	    Sanctifies our troubled home.
514	    Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows
514	    Break like ripples on the strand
514	    Of the deep and solemn river
514	    Where her willing feet now stand.
514	""
514	    O my sister, passing from me,
514	    Out of human care and strife,
514	    Leave me, as a gift, those virtues
514	    Which have beautified your life.
514	    Dear, bequeath me that great patience
514	    Which has power to sustain
514	    A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit
514	    In its prison-house of pain.
514	""
514	    Give me, for I need it sorely,
514	    Of that courage, wise and sweet,
514	    Which has made the path of duty
514	    Green beneath your willing feet.
514	    Give me that unselfish nature,
514	    That with charity divine
514	    Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake--
514	    Meek heart, forgive me mine!
514	""
514	    Thus our parting daily loseth
514	    Something of its bitter pain,
514	    And while learning this hard lesson,
514	    My great loss becomes my gain.
514	    For the touch of grief will render
514	    My wild nature more serene,
514	    Give to life new aspirations,
514	    A new trust in the unseen.
514	""
514	    Henceforth, safe across the river,
514	    I shall see forever more
514	    A beloved, household spirit
514	    Waiting for me on the shore.
514	    Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,
514	    Guardian angels shall become,
514	    And the sister gone before me
514	    By their hands shall lead me home.
514	""
514	Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought
514	a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one regret had
514	been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure her that
514	her life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the
514	despair she feared.  As she sat with the paper folded between her
514	hands, the charred log fell asunder.  Jo started up, revived the blaze,
514	and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.
514	""
514	"""Not asleep, but so happy, dear.  See, I found this and read it. I knew"
514	"you wouldn't care.  Have I been all that to you, Jo?"" she asked, with"
514	wistful, humble earnestness.
514	""
514	"""_Oh_, Beth, so much, so much!"" and Jo's head went down upon the pillow"
514	beside her sister's.
514	""
514	"""Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life.  I'm not so good as you"
514	make me, but I have tried to do right.  And now, when it's too late to
514	begin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that someone loves
514	"me so much, and feels as if I'd helped them."""
514	""
514	"""More than any one in the world, Beth.  I used to think I couldn't let"
514	you go, but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose you, that you'll be
514	"more to me than ever, and death can't part us, though it seems to."""
514	""
514	"""I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm sure I shall"
514	be your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever.  You must take
514	my place, Jo, and be everything to Father and Mother when I'm gone.
514	They will turn to you, don't fail them, and if it's hard to work alone,
514	remember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing
514	that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world, for love is
514	the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the
514	"end so easy."""
514	""
514	"""I'll try, Beth."" and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,"
514	pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of
514	other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the
514	immortality of love.
514	""
514	So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth
514	greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came back in
514	time to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child,
514	clung to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father and Mother
514	guided her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up
514	to God.
514	""
514	Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see visions,
514	or depart with beatified countenances, and those who have sped many
514	parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply
514	as sleep.  As Beth had hoped, the 'tide went out easily', and in the
514	dark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her first
514	breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving
514	look, one little sigh.
514	""
514	With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her
514	ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with
514	grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic
514	patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling with reverent
514	joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom
514	full of dread.
514	""
514	When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,
514	Jo's place was empty, and the room was very still.  But a bird sang
514	blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed freshly
514	at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction
514	over the placid face upon the pillow, a face so full of painless peace
514	that those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked
514	God that Beth was well at last.
514	""

514	CHAPTER FORTY-ONE
514	""
514	LEARNING TO FORGET
514	""
514	Amy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it
514	till long afterward.  Men seldom do, for when women are the advisers,
514	the lords of creation don't take the advice till they have persuaded
514	themselves that it is just what they intended to do.  Then they act
514	upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the
514	credit of it.  If it fails, they generously give her the whole.  Laurie
514	went back to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several
514	weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved
514	him wonderfully, and he had better try it again. There was nothing the
514	young gentleman would have liked better, but elephants could not have
514	dragged him back after the scolding he had received.  Pride forbid, and
514	whenever the longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by
514	"repeating the words that had made the deepest impression--""I despise"
514	"you."" ""Go and do something splendid that will make her love you."""
514	""
514	Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought
514	himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy, but then when a
514	man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries
514	till he has lived it down.  He felt that his blighted affections were
514	quite dead now, and though he should never cease to be a faithful
514	mourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously.  Jo
514	wouldn't love him, but he might make her respect and admire him by
514	doing something which should prove that a girl's 'No' had not spoiled
514	his life.  He had always meant to do something, and Amy's advice was
514	quite unnecessary.  He had only been waiting till the aforesaid
514	blighted affections were decently interred. That being done, he felt
514	that he was ready to 'hide his stricken heart, and still toil on'.
514	""
514	As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie
514	resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to compose a Requiem
514	which should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of every hearer.
514	Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless
514	and moody and ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical
514	friends, and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish
514	himself.  But whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music,
514	or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that
514	the Requiem was beyond him just at present.  It was evident that his
514	mind was not in working order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying, for
514	often in the middle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself
514	humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at
514	Nice, especially the stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to
514	tragic composition for the time being.
514	""
514	Then he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning,
514	but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him.  He wanted Jo for his
514	heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender
514	recollections and romantic visions of his love.  But memory turned
514	traitor, and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would
514	only recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in
514	the most unsentimental aspects--beating mats with her head tied up in a
514	bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing cold
514	water over his passion a la Gummidge--and an irresistable laugh spoiled
514	the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint.  Jo wouldn't be put
514	"into the opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a ""Bless"
514	"that girl, what a torment she is!"" and a clutch at his hair, as became"
514	a distracted composer.
514	""
514	When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to
514	immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging
514	readiness.  This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden
514	hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before
514	his mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies,
514	and blue ribbons.  He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but
514	he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as well he
514	might, for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and
514	escorted her, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated
514	any mortal woman.
514	""
514	Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but
514	gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he
514	sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get some new
514	ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled
514	state that winter.  He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and
514	was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself.
514	"""It's genius simmering, perhaps.  I'll let it simmer, and see what"
514	"comes of it,"" he said, with a secret suspicion all the while that it"
514	wasn't genius, but something far more common.  Whatever it was, it
514	simmered to some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with
514	his desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go
514	at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that
514	everyone who loved music was not a composer.  Returning from one of
514	Mozart's grand operas, splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he
514	looked over his own, played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the
514	busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back
514	again.  Then suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as
514	the last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself...
514	""
514	"""She is right!  Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so.  That"
514	music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I
514	"won't be a humbug any longer.  Now what shall I do?"""
514	""
514	That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had
514	to work for his daily bread.  Now if ever, occurred an eligible
514	opportunity for 'going to the devil', as he once forcibly expressed it,
514	for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially
514	fond of providing employment for full and idle hands.  The poor fellow
514	had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood
514	them pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith
514	and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire
514	to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,
514	"and say ""All's well,"" kept him safe and steady."
514	""
514	"Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, ""I don't believe it, boys"
514	will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not
514	"expect miracles.""  I dare say you don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true"
514	nevertheless.  Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion
514	that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by
514	refusing to echo such sayings.  Let the boys be boys, the longer the
514	better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must.  But
514	mothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one,
514	and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and
514	showing that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues
514	which make men manliest in good women's eyes.  If it is a feminine
514	delusion, leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the
514	beauty and the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would
514	embitter all our hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who
514	still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to
514	own it.
514	""
514	Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb
514	all his powers for years, but to his great surprise he discovered it
514	grew easier every day.  He refused to believe it at first, got angry
514	with himself, and couldn't understand it, but these hearts of ours are
514	curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in
514	spite of us.  Laurie's heart wouldn't ache.  The wound persisted in
514	healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and instead of trying to
514	forget, he found himself trying to remember.  He had not foreseen this
514	turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it.  He was disgusted with
514	himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture
514	of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a
514	tremendous blow so soon.  He carefully stirred up the embers of his
514	lost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze.  There was only a
514	comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into
514	a fever, and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish
514	passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very
514	tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was sure to pass
514	away in time, leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken
514	to the end.
514	""
514	As the word 'brotherly' passed through his mind in one of his reveries,
514	he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was before
514	him...
514	""
514	"""Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn't have one sister he took"
514	"the other, and was happy."""
514	""
514	Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the next
514	"instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, ""No, I won't!  I"
514	haven't forgotten, I never can.  I'll try again, and if that fails, why
514	"then..."""
514	""
514	Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to
514	Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was
514	the least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't
514	she--and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he
514	did nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of
514	impatience.  It came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one
514	point, for Jo decidedly couldn't and wouldn't.  She was wrapped up in
514	Beth, and never wished to hear the word love again.  Then she begged
514	him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of
514	his heart for his loving sister Jo.  In a postscript she desired him
514	not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring
514	and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay.  That
514	would be time enough, please God, but Laurie must write to her often,
514	and not let her feel lonely, homesick or anxious.
514	""
514	"""So I will, at once.  Poor little girl, it will be a sad going home for"
514	"her, I'm afraid,"" and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had"
514	been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks
514	before.
514	""
514	But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out his
514	best paper, he came across something which changed his purpose.
514	Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and
514	business documents of various kinds were several of Jo's letters, and
514	in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up
514	with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead
514	roses put away inside.  With a half-repentant, half-amused expression,
514	Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them
514	neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring
514	thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the
514	letters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint
514	Stefan's, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not
514	overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the
514	rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies.
514	""
514	The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy
514	was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding
514	manner.  The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to
514	and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring.  Laurie
514	sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris,
514	hoping somebody would arrive before long.  He wanted desperately to go
514	to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not ask him,
514	for just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made
514	her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of 'our boy'.
514	""
514	Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once
514	"decided to answer, ""Yes, thank you,"" but now she said, ""No, thank you,"""
514	kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her courage failed her,
514	and she found that something more than money and position was needed to
514	satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes
514	"and fears.  The words, ""Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I"
514	"fancied you would ever like,"" and Laurie's face when he uttered them,"
514	kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in
514	"look, if not in words, ""I shall marry for money.""  It troubled her to"
514	remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so
514	unwomanly. She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless,  worldly
514	creature.  She didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as
514	she did to be a lovable woman.  She was so glad he didn't hate her for
514	the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was
514	kinder than ever.  His letters were such a comfort, for the home
514	letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when
514	they did come.  It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them,
514	for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted
514	in being stonyhearted.  She ought to have made an effort and tried to
514	love him.  It couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and
514	glad to have such a dear boy care for them.  But Jo never would act
514	like other girls, so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat
514	him like a brother.
514	""
514	If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they
514	would be a much happier race of beings than they are.  Amy never
514	lectured now.  She asked his opinion on all subjects, she was
514	interested in everything he did, made charming little presents for him,
514	and sent him two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly
514	confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her.
514	As few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about
514	in their sister's pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when
514	short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that
514	Amy did any of these fond and foolish things.  But she certainly did
514	grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for
514	society, and went out sketching alone a good deal.  She never had much
514	to show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while
514	she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or
514	absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her, a stalwart knight
514	carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over
514	his eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a
514	ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur
514	according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether
514	satisfactory.
514	""
514	Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding
514	denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what
514	she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to
514	Egypt.  That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he
514	said to himself, with a venerable air...
514	""
514	"""I was sure she would think better of it.  Poor old fellow! I've been"
514	"through it all, and I can sympathize."""
514	""
514	With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his
514	duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy's letter
514	luxuriously.
514	""
514	While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home.
514	But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and
514	when they next found her the grass was green above her sister. The sad
514	news met her at at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in
514	May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and
514	the Italian lakes.  She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to
514	the family decree that she should not shorten her visit, for since it
514	was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better stay, and let
514	absence soften her sorrow.  But her heart was very heavy, she longed
514	to be at home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake, waiting
514	for Laurie to come and comfort her.
514	""
514	He did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them both,
514	but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him.  The moment
514	he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow
514	pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy
514	and sorrow, hope and suspense.
514	""
514	He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he
514	hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living en
514	pension.  The garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to
514	take a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be
514	in the chateau garden.  If monsieur would give himself the pain of
514	sitting down, a flash of time should present her.  But monsieur could
514	not wait even a 'flash of time', and in the middle of the speech
514	departed to find mademoiselle himself.
514	""
514	A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts
514	rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the
514	tower falling far across the sunny water.  At one corner of the wide,
514	low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or
514	console herself with the beauty all about her.  She was sitting here
514	that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy
514	eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come.  She did
514	not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the
514	archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden.  He stood
514	a minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen
514	before, the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely
514	suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black
514	ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her
514	face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to
514	Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only
514	ornament. If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him,
514	they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for
514	dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of
514	unmistakable love and longing...
514	""
514	"""Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!"""
514	""
514	I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood
514	together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down
514	protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and
514	sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only
514	woman in the world who could fill Jo's place and make him happy.  He
514	did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the
514	truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.
514	""
514	In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her tears,
514	Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry
514	well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future.
514	As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at
514	the recollection of her impulsive greeting.
514	""
514	"""I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to"
514	see you.  It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was
514	"beginning to fear you wouldn't come,"" she said, trying in vain to speak"
514	quite naturally.
514	""
514	"""I came the minute I heard.  I wish I could say something to comfort"
514	"you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and...""  He"
514	could not get any further, for he too turned bashful all of a sudden,
514	and did not quite know what to say.  He longed to lay Amy's head down
514	on his shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare,
514	so took her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was
514	better than words.
514	""
514	"""You needn't say anything, this comforts me,"" she said softly.  ""Beth"
514	is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back, but I dread the going
514	home, much as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for
514	it makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay.  You needn't
514	"go right back, need you?"""
514	""
514	"""Not if you want me, dear."""
514	""
514	"""I do, so much.  Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like one of"
514	the family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little
514	"while."""
514	""
514	Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that
514	Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what she
514	wanted--the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she
514	needed.
514	""
514	"""Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half sick!"
514	I'm going to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but come and walk
514	"about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,"" he said,"
514	in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied
514	on her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the
514	sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts.  He felt more at ease upon
514	his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon,
514	a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully
514	for her alone.
514	""
514	The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed
514	expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but
514	the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of
514	their words, as it rippled by below.  For an hour this new pair walked
514	and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which
514	gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell
514	warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and
514	sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.
514	""
514	The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated
514	"with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, ""Now I understand it"
514	all--the child has been pining for young Laurence.  Bless my heart, I
514	"never thought of such a thing!"""
514	""
514	With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed
514	no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged
514	Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much
514	solitude.  Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal
514	occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it
514	with more than her usual success.
514	""
514	At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded.  At Vevay, Laurie was
514	never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the
514	most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did and followed
514	his example as far and as fast as she could.  He said the change was
514	owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a
514	like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.
514	""
514	The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked
514	wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get
514	clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills.
514	The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and
514	moody mists.  The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of
514	aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts.  The lake seemed to
514	wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look
514	"benignly down upon them saying, ""Little children, love one another."""
514	""
514	In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that
514	Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word.  It took him a little
514	while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first, and as he
514	had firmly believed, his last and only love.  He consoled himself for
514	the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost the
514	same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been
514	impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well.  His
514	first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon
514	it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion
514	blended with regret.  He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one
514	of the bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be
514	grateful when the pain was over. His second wooing, he resolved, should
514	be as calm and simple as possible.  There was no need of having a
514	scene, hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it
514	without words and had given him his answer long ago.  It all came about
514	so naturally that no one could complain, and he knew that everybody
514	would be pleased, even Jo.  But when our first little passion has been
514	crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so
514	Laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance
514	the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and
514	sweetest part of his new romance.
514	""
514	He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the
514	chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous
514	manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was
514	settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been
514	floating about all the morning, from gloomy St.  Gingolf to sunny
514	Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St.  Bernard and the
514	Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne
514	upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake
514	below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged
514	gulls.
514	""
514	They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of
514	Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his Heloise.
514	Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love story, and each
514	privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own.  Amy had
514	been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell
514	between them, and when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars
514	with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for
514	the sake of saying something...
514	""
514	"""You must be tired.  Rest a little, and let me row.  It will do me"
514	"good, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious."""
514	""
514	"""I'm not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like.  There's room"
514	enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't
514	"trim,"" returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement."
514	""
514	Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered
514	third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar.
514	She rowed as well as she did many other things, and though she used
514	both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went
514	smoothly through the water.
514	""
514	"""How well we pull together, don't we?"" said Amy, who objected to"
514	silence just then.
514	""
514	"""So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,"
514	"Amy?"" very tenderly."
514	""
514	"""Yes, Laurie,"" very low."
514	""
514	Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little
514	tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected
514	in the lake.
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER FORTY-TWO
514	""
514	ALL ALONE
514	""
514	It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in
514	another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example.  But when
514	the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved
514	presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo
514	found her promise very hard to keep.  How could she 'comfort Father and
514	Mother' when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her
514	sister, how could she 'make the house cheerful' when all its light and
514	warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old
514	home for the new, and where in all the world could she 'find some
514	useful, happy work to do', that would take the place of the loving
514	service which had been its own reward?  She tried in a blind, hopeless
514	way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it
514	seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made
514	heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along.  Some
514	people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow.  It was not
514	fair, for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward,
514	only disappointment, trouble and hard work.
514	""
514	Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came
514	over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house,
514	devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that
514	"never seemed to grow any easier.  ""I can't do it. I wasn't meant for a"
514	life like this, and I know I shall break away and do something
514	"desperate if somebody doesn't come and help me,"" she said to herself,"
514	when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody, miserable
514	state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the
514	inevitable.
514	""
514	But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good
514	angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple
514	spells best fitted to poor humanity.  Often she started up at night,
514	thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the little empty bed
514	"made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow, ""Oh, Beth,"
514	"come back!  Come back!"" she did not stretch out her yearning arms in"
514	vain.  For, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her
514	sister's faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with
514	words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears
514	that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken
514	whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went
514	hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to
514	heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,
514	which chastened grief and strengthened love.  Feeling this, Jo's burden
514	seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more
514	endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother's arms.
514	""
514	When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found
514	help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over the good gray
514	head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said very humbly,
514	"""Father, talk to me as you did to Beth.  I need it more than she did,"
514	"for I'm all wrong."""
514	""
514	"""My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,"" he answered, with a falter"
514	in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too, needed help, and
514	did not fear to ask for it.
514	""
514	Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told her
514	troubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that
514	discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all
514	the sad bewilderment which we call despair.  She gave him entire
514	confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation
514	in the act.  For the time had come when they could talk together not
514	only as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to
514	serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love.  Happy,
514	thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called 'the church of
514	one member', and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered
514	cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit. For the parents who had
514	taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach
514	another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its
514	beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.
514	""
514	Other helps had Jo--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would
514	not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned
514	to see and value.  Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful
514	as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both, and something
514	of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and
514	the old brush, never thrown away.  As she used them, Jo found herself
514	humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and
514	giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and
514	cozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she
514	didn't know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand...
514	""
514	"""You thoughtful creeter, you're determined we shan't miss that dear"
514	lamb ef you can help it.  We don't say much, but we see it, and the
514	"Lord will bless you for't, see ef He don't."""
514	""
514	As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister
514	Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew about good, womanly
514	impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and
514	children, and how much they were all doing for each other.
514	""
514	"""Marriage is an excellent thing, after all.  I wonder if I should"
514	blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?, always
514	"_'perwisin'_ I could,"" said Jo, as she constructed a kite for Demi in"
514	the topsy-turvy nursery.
514	""
514	"""It's just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your"
514	nature, Jo.  You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, but
514	silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at it.  Love
514	will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough burr will
514	"fall off."""
514	""
514	"""Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to bring"
514	"them down.  Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by them,"""
514	returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would
514	ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.
514	""
514	Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old spirit, but
514	she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her
514	power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of
514	Meg's most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.
514	Grief is the best opener of some hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for
514	the bag.  A little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's
514	impatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the
514	burr, and find the kernal sound and sweet. If she suspected this, she
514	would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately
514	she wasn't thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she
514	dropped.
514	""
514	Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought at
514	this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the
514	world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in
514	her pocket.  But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine, she was only a
514	struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just acted out
514	her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood
514	suggested.  It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do
514	it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all
514	together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way.  Jo
514	had got so far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if
514	she did not, but to do it cheerfully, ah, that was another thing!  She
514	had often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard,
514	and now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to
514	devote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to
514	them as they had to her?  And if difficulties were necessary to
514	increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a
514	restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and
514	desires, and cheerfully live for others?
514	""
514	Providence had taken her at her word.  Here was the task, not what she
514	had expected, but better because self had no part in it. Now, could she
514	do it?  She decided that she would try, and in her first attempt she
514	found the helps I have suggested.  Still another was given her, and she
514	took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the
514	refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed
514	the hill called Difficulty.
514	""
514	"""Why don't you write?  That always used to make you happy,"" said her"
514	mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.
514	""
514	"""I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things."""
514	""
514	"""We do.  Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world."
514	"Try it, dear.  I'm sure it would do you good, and please us very much."""
514	""
514	"""Don't believe I can.""  But Jo got out her desk and began to overhaul"
514	her half-finished manuscripts.
514	""
514	An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching
514	away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which
514	caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the success
514	of her suggestion.  Jo never knew how it happened, but something got
514	into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it,
514	for when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it,
514	much against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and to her
514	utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested.
514	Letters from several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the
514	appearance of the little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as
514	well as friends admired it.  For a small thing it was a great success,
514	and Jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and
514	condemned all at once.
514	""
514	"""I don't understand it.  What can there be in a simple little story"
514	"like that to make people praise it so?"" she said, quite bewildered."
514	""
514	"""There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret.  Humor and pathos make it"
514	alive, and you have found your style at last.  You wrote with no
514	thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it, my daughter.
514	You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet.  Do your best, and grow
514	"as happy as we are in your success."""
514	""
514	"""If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn't mine.  I"
514	"owe it all to you and Mother and Beth,"" said Jo, more touched by her"
514	father's words than by any amount of praise from the world.
514	""
514	So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent
514	them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very
514	charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were kindly
514	welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like
514	dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.
514	""
514	When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that
514	Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon
514	set at rest, for though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very
514	quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for 'the children' before she
514	read the letter twice.  It was a sort of written duet, wherein each
514	glorified the other in loverlike fashion, very pleasant to read and
514	satisfactory to think of, for no one had any objection to make.
514	""
514	"""You like it, Mother?"" said Jo, as they laid down the closely written"
514	sheets and looked at one another.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused"
514	Fred.  I felt sure then that something better than what you call the
514	'mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a hint here and there in her
514	"letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day."""
514	""
514	"""How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent!  You never said a word to"
514	"me."""
514	""
514	"""Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have"
514	girls to manage.  I was half afraid to put the idea into your head,
514	lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was
514	"settled."""
514	""
514	"""I'm not the scatterbrain I was.  You may trust me.  I'm sober and"
514	"sensible enough for anyone's confidante now."""
514	""
514	"""So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied"
514	"it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone else."""
514	""
514	"""Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish,"
514	"after I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?"""
514	""
514	"""I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he"
514	came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like giving another
514	answer.  Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that you are very
514	lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to
514	my heart.  So I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he
514	"tried now."""
514	""
514	"""No, Mother, it is better as it is, and I'm glad Amy has learned to"
514	love him.  But you are right in one thing.  I am lonely, and perhaps if
514	Teddy had tried again, I might have said 'Yes', not because I love him
514	"any more, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away."""
514	""
514	"""I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are"
514	plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father and Mother,
514	sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all
514	"comes to give you your reward."""
514	""
514	"""Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don't mind whispering"
514	to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds.  It's very curious, but the
514	more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the
514	more I seem to want.  I'd no idea hearts could take in so many.  Mine
514	is so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite
514	"contented with my family.  I don't understand it."""
514	""
514	"""I do,"" and Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the"
514	leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.
514	""
514	"""It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me.  He isn't"
514	sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he
514	says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don't seem
514	to be the same girl I was.  I never knew how good and generous and
514	tender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it
514	full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know
514	it's mine.  He says he feels as if he 'could make a prosperous voyage
514	now with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast'.  I pray he
514	may, and try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain
514	with all my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while
514	God lets us be together. Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven
514	"this world could be, when two people love and live for one another!"""
514	""
514	"""And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy!  Truly, love does work"
514	"miracles.  How very, very happy they must be!"" and Jo laid the rustling"
514	sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a
514	lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he
514	finds himself alone in the workaday world again.
514	""
514	By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not
514	walk.  A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again,
514	not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one
514	sister should have all she asked, the other nothing.  It was not true,
514	she knew that and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for
514	affection was strong, and Amy's happiness woke the hungry longing for
514	someone to 'love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them
514	be together'. Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended
514	stood four little wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owners
514	name, and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended
514	now for all.  Jo glanced into them, and when she came to her own,
514	leaned her chin on the edge, and stared absently at the chaotic
514	collection, till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye.  She
514	drew them out, turned them over, and relived that pleasant winter at
514	kind Mrs. Kirke's.  She had smiled at first, then she looked
514	thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a little message written in
514	the Professor's hand, her lips began to tremble, the books slid out of
514	her lap, and she sat looking at the friendly words, as they took a new
514	meaning, and touched a tender spot in her heart.
514	""
514	"""Wait for me, my friend.  I may be a little late, but I shall surely"
514	"come."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, if he only would!  So kind, so good, so patient with me always, my"
514	dear old Fritz.  I didn't value him half enough when I had him, but now
514	how I should love to see him, for everyone seems going away from me,
514	"and I'm all alone."""
514	""
514	And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be
514	fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag, and cried,
514	as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.
514	""
514	Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits?  Or was it the waking
514	up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its
514	inspirer?  Who shall say?
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER FORTY-THREE
514	""
514	SURPRISES
514	""
514	Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the
514	fire, and thinking.  It was her favorite way of spending the hour of
514	dusk.  No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little
514	red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender
514	thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away.  Her face looked
514	tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she
514	was thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and
514	how little she seemed to have accomplished.  Almost twenty-five, and
514	nothing to show for it.  Jo was mistaken in that.  There was a good
514	deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.
514	""
514	"""An old maid, that's what I'm to be.  A literary spinster, with a pen"
514	for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence
514	a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I'm old and can't
514	enjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it.
514	Well, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say,
514	"old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but..."" and"
514	there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.
514	""
514	It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to
514	five-and-twenty.  But it's not as bad as it looks, and one can get on
514	quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall back upon.  At
514	twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly
514	resolve that they never will be.  At thirty they say nothing about it,
514	but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by
514	remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which
514	they may be learning to grow old gracefully.  Don't laugh at the
514	spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are
514	hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,
514	and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself,
514	make the faded faces beautiful in God's sight.  Even the sad, sour
514	sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the
514	sweetest part of life, if for no other reason.  And looking at them
514	with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember
514	that they too may miss the blossom time.  That rosy cheeks don't last
514	forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and
514	that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and
514	admiration now.
514	""
514	Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter
514	how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that
514	which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,
514	and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color.  Just recollect
514	the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and
514	petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out
514	of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches
514	the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old
514	feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little
514	attentions that women love to receive as long as they live.  The
514	bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all
514	the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that can part
514	mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a
514	tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who
514	has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for 'the best nevvy
514	in the world'.
514	""
514	Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this
514	little homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand before her,
514	a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her with the very look he
514	used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't like to show it.  But,
514	like Jenny in the ballad...
514	""
514	"  ""She could not think it he,"""
514	""
514	and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and
514	kissed her.  Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully...
514	""
514	"""Oh my Teddy!  Oh my Teddy!"""
514	""
514	"""Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?"""
514	""
514	"""Glad!  My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy?"""
514	""
514	"""Your mother has got her down at Meg's.  We stopped there by the way,"
514	"and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches."""
514	""
514	"""Your what?"" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an"
514	unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.
514	""
514	"""Oh, the dickens!  Now I've done it,"" and he looked so guilty that Jo"
514	was down on him like a flash.
514	""
514	"""You've gone and got married!"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, please, but I never will again,"" and he went down upon his knees,"
514	with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth,
514	and triumph.
514	""
514	"""Actually married?"""
514	""
514	"""Very much so, thank you."""
514	""
514	"""Mercy on us.  What dreadful thing will you do next?"" and Jo fell into"
514	her seat with a gasp.
514	""
514	"""A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,"""
514	returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with
514	satisfaction.
514	""
514	"""What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like"
514	a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you
514	"ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it."""
514	""
514	"""Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to"
514	"barricade."""
514	""
514	Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted
514	"the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, ""The old pillow is"
514	"up garret, and we don't need it now.  So, come and 'fess, Teddy."""
514	""
514	"""How good it sounds to hear you say 'Teddy'! No one ever calls me that"
514	"but you,"" and Laurie sat down with an air of great content."
514	""
514	"""What does Amy call you?"""
514	""
514	"""My lord."""
514	""
514	"""That's like her.  Well, you look it,"" and Jo's eye plainly betrayed"
514	that she found her boy comelier than ever.
514	""
514	The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural
514	one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart.  Both felt it, and
514	for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a
514	little shadow over them.  It was gone directly however, for Laurie
514	said, with a vain attempt at dignity...
514	""
514	"""Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?"""
514	""
514	"""Not a bit, and you never will.  You've grown bigger and bonnier, but"
514	"you are the same scapegrace as ever."""
514	""
514	"""Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,"" began"
514	Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.
514	""
514	"""How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so"
514	"irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!"" answered Jo, smiling all"
514	over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then
514	settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.
514	""
514	"""It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all"
514	coming up presently.  I couldn't wait.  I wanted to be the one to tell
514	you the grand surprise, and have 'first skim' as we used to say when we
514	"squabbled about the cream."""
514	""
514	"""Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong"
514	end.  Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I'm pining to
514	"know."""
514	""
514	"""Well, I did it to please Amy,"" began Laurie, with a twinkle that made"
514	Jo exclaim...
514	""
514	"""Fib number one.  Amy did it to please you.  Go on, and tell the truth,"
514	"if you can, sir."""
514	""
514	"""Now she's beginning to marm it.  Isn't it jolly to hear her?"" said"
514	Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite
514	"agreed.  ""It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned"
514	to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly
514	changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris.  But
514	Grandpa wanted to come home.  He went to please me, and I couldn't let
514	him go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got
514	English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy
514	come with us.  So I just settled the difficulty by saying, 'Let's be
514	"married, and then we can do as we like'."""
514	""
514	"""Of course you did.  You always have things to suit you."""
514	""
514	"""Not always,"" and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily..."
514	""
514	"""How did you ever get Aunt to agree?"""
514	""
514	"""It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps"
514	of good reasons on our side.  There wasn't time to write and ask leave,
514	but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only
514	"'taking time by the fetlock', as my wife says."""
514	""
514	"""Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?"""
514	interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with
514	delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been
514	so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.
514	""
514	"""A trifle, perhaps, she's such a captivating little woman I can't help"
514	being proud of her.  Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play
514	propriety.  We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use
514	apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all
514	"round, so we did it."""
514	""
514	"""When, where, how?"" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and"
514	curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.
514	""
514	"""Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris, a very quiet"
514	wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear
514	"little Beth."""
514	""
514	Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the
514	little red pillow, which he remembered well.
514	""
514	"""Why didn't you let us know afterward?"" asked Jo, in a quieter tone,"
514	when they had sat quite still a minute.
514	""
514	"""We wanted to surprise you.  We thought we were coming directly home,"
514	at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found
514	he couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend
514	our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular
514	honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but
514	"once in their lives. My faith!  Wasn't it love among the roses!"""
514	""
514	Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the
514	fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured
514	her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away
514	her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the
514	half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly
514	gravity she had never seen in him before...
514	""
514	"""Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by forever."
514	As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to
514	me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is altered, and I have
514	learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places
514	in my heart, that's all.  I think it was meant to be so, and would have
514	come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I
514	never could be patient, and so I got a heartache.  I was a boy then,
514	headstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my
514	mistake.  For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after
514	making a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind,
514	at one time, that I didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and
514	tried to love you both alike.  But I couldn't, and when I saw her in
514	Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once.  You both got
514	into your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the
514	old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my
514	heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you
514	believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one
514	"another?"""
514	""
514	"""I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy"
514	and girl again.  The happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't
514	expect it.  We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for
514	playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking.  I'm sure you feel
514	this.  I see the change in you, and you'll find it in me.  I shall miss
514	my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because
514	he means to be what I hoped he would.  We can't be little playmates any
514	longer, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another
514	"all our lives, won't we, Laurie?"""
514	""
514	He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his
514	face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish
514	passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them
514	both.  Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming
514	"home to be a sad one, ""I can't make it true that you children are"
514	really married and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only
514	yesterday that I was buttoning Amy's pinafore, and pulling your hair
514	"when you teased.  Mercy me, how time does fly!"""
514	""
514	"""As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so"
514	like a grandma.  I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed' as Peggotty
514	said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a
514	"precocious infant,"" said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air."
514	""
514	"""You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in"
514	feeling, Teddy.  Women always are, and this last year has been such a
514	"hard one that I feel forty."""
514	""
514	"""Poor Jo!  We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You"
514	are older.  Here's a line, and there's another.  Unless you smile, your
514	eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear
514	on it.  You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.
514	"What a selfish beast I've been!"" and Laurie pulled his own hair, with a"
514	remorseful look.
514	""
514	But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone
514	"which she tried to make more cheerful, ""No, I had Father and Mother to"
514	help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you
514	and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear.
514	"I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's good for me, and..."""
514	""
514	"""You never shall be again,"" broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her,"
514	"as if to fence out every human ill.  ""Amy and I can't get on without"
514	you, so you must come and teach 'the children' to keep house, and go
514	halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and
514	"all be blissfully happy and friendly together."""
514	""
514	"""If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant.  I begin to"
514	feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly
514	"away when you came.  You always were a comfort, Teddy,"" and Jo leaned"
514	her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill
514	and Laurie told her to hold on to him.
514	""
514	He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was
514	smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his
514	coming.
514	""
514	"""You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and"
514	"laughing the next.  You look a little wicked now.  What is it, Grandma?"""
514	""
514	"""I was wondering how you and Amy get on together."""
514	""
514	"""Like angels!"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, of course, but which rules?"""
514	""
514	"""I don't mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her think"
514	so, it pleases her, you know.  By-and-by we shall take turns, for
514	"marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's duties."""
514	""
514	"""You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your"
514	"life."""
514	""
514	"""Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind"
514	much.  She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well.  In fact, I
514	rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and
514	prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you
514	"a favor all the while."""
514	""
514	"""That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying"
514	"it!"" cried Jo, with uplifted hands."
514	""
514	It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with
514	"masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his ""high and"
514	"mighty"" air, ""Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of"
514	man to submit to it.  My wife and I respect ourselves and one another
514	"too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel."""
514	""
514	Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy
514	seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her
514	pleasure.
514	""
514	"""I am sure of that.  Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She"
514	is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man
514	"best, you remember."""
514	""
514	"""She can blow him up as well as shine on him,"" laughed Laurie. ""Such a"
514	lecture as I got at Nice!  I give you my word it was a deal worse than
514	any of your scoldings, a regular rouser.  I'll tell you all about it
514	sometime, she never will, because after telling me that she despised
514	and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and
514	"married the good-for-nothing."""
514	""
514	"""What baseness!  Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll defend"
514	"you."""
514	""
514	"""I look as if I needed it, don't I?"" said Laurie, getting up and"
514	striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the
514	"rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, ""Where is she? Where's my"
514	"dear old Jo?"""
514	""
514	In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all
514	over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were
514	set down to be looked at and exulted over.  Mr. Laurence, hale and
514	hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign
514	tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the
514	old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier
514	than ever.  It was good to see him beam at 'my children', as he called
514	the young pair.  It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly
514	duty and affection which completely won his old heart, and best of all,
514	to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying
514	the pretty picture they made.
514	""
514	The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own
514	dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely
514	eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that 'her ladyship' was altogether
514	a most elegant and graceful woman.  Jo thought, as she watched the
514	"pair, ""How well they look together!  I was right, and Laurie has found"
514	the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than
514	"clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.""  Mrs. March and"
514	her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they
514	saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but
514	the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.
514	""
514	For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a
514	peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,
514	prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and
514	winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of
514	her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for
514	it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true
514	gentlewoman she had hoped to become.
514	""
514	"""Love has done much for our little girl,"" said her mother softly."
514	""
514	"""She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,"" Mr."
514	March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head
514	beside him.
514	""
514	Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her 'pitty aunty', but
514	attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of
514	delightful charms.  Demi paused to consider the new relationship before
514	he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took
514	the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank
514	movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew
514	where to have him.
514	""
514	"""Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you"
514	"hit me in the face.  Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,"" and"
514	with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew
514	in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted
514	his boyish soul.
514	""
514	"""Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot; ain't it a relishin'"
514	sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks
514	"calling little Amy 'Mis.  Laurence!'"" muttered old Hannah, who could"
514	"not resist frequent ""peeks"" through the slide as she set the table in a"
514	most decidedly promiscuous manner.
514	""
514	Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all
514	burst out together--trying to tell the history of three years in half
514	an hour.  It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and
514	provide refreshment--for they would have been hoarse and faint if they
514	had gone on much longer.  Such a happy procession as filed away into
514	the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence.  Mrs.
514	March as proudly leaned on the arm of 'my son'. The old gentleman took
514	"Jo, with a whispered, ""You must be my girl now,"" and a glance at the"
514	"empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, ""I'll try to fill"
514	"her place, sir."""
514	""
514	The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for
514	everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at
514	their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the
514	opportunity.  Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad
514	libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn't
514	they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets,
514	there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human
514	nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness
514	of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would
514	pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty,
514	the little sinners attached themselves to 'Dranpa', who hadn't his
514	spectacles on.  Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned
514	to the parlor on Father Laurence's arm.  The others paired off as
514	before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless.  She did not mind
514	it at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry.
514	""
514	"""Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver"
514	"dishes that's stored away over yander?"""
514	""
514	"""Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate,"
514	and wore diamonds and point lace every day.  Teddy thinks nothing too
514	"good for her,"" returned Jo with infinite satisfaction."
514	""
514	"""No more there is!  Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?"""
514	asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.
514	""
514	"""I don't care,"" and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an"
514	uncongenial topic just then.  She stood a minute looking at the party
514	vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last
514	stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she
514	looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,
514	for even Teddy had deserted her.  If she had known what birthday gift
514	was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to
514	"herself, ""I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won't do to be"
514	"dismal now.""  Then she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her"
514	boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was, and had
514	just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch
514	door.
514	""
514	She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had
514	come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming
514	on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.
514	""
514	"""Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!"" cried Jo, with a clutch, as"
514	if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him
514	in.
514	""
514	"""And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,"" and the Professor"
514	paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to
514	them.
514	""
514	"""No, we haven't, only the family.  My sister and friends have just come"
514	"home, and we are all very happy.  Come in, and make one of us."""
514	""
514	Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously
514	away, and come again another day, but how could he, when Jo shut the
514	door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had
514	something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him,
514	and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary
514	man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.
514	""
514	"""If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all."
514	"You haf been ill, my friend?"""
514	""
514	He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light
514	fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.
514	""
514	"""Not ill, but tired and sorrowful.  We have had trouble since I saw you"
514	"last."""
514	""
514	"""Ah, yes, I know.  My heart was sore for you when I heard that,"" and he"
514	shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no
514	comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,
514	warm hand.
514	""
514	"""Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,"" she said, with a"
514	face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might
514	as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.
514	""
514	If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set at
514	rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone greeted
514	him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for
514	his own.  They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that
514	opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once,
514	feeling even the more friendly because he was poor.  For poverty
514	enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly
514	hospitable spirits.  Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a
514	traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself
514	at home.  The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and
514	establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by
514	rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch,
514	with juvenile audacity.  The women telegraphed their approval to one
514	another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit,
514	opened his choicest stores for his guest's benefit, while silent John
514	listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence
514	found it impossible to go to sleep.
514	""
514	If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have
514	amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like
514	suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe
514	the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.
514	He got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew it, was drawn
514	into the circle.  For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,
514	and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at
514	him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting
514	his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime.  Then his
514	eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered
514	the mute inquiry if she had seen it.  But Jo had her own eyes to take
514	care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept
514	them on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.
514	""
514	A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water
514	after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several
514	propitious omens.  Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded
514	expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment,
514	actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him
514	with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment.
514	Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the
514	ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be
514	considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when
514	Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she
514	"watched her father's absorbed face, ""How he would enjoy having such a"
514	"man as my Professor to talk with every day!""  Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was"
514	dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a
514	gentleman than ever.  His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed,
514	but didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it
514	up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect
514	better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a
514	Jove-like aspect.  Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she
514	sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even
514	the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his
514	immaculate wristbands.
514	""
514	"""Dear old fellow!  He couldn't have got himself up with more care if"
514	"he'd been going a-wooing,"" said Jo to herself, and then a sudden"
514	thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to
514	drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.
514	""
514	The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for
514	though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor
514	dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the
514	little blue ball.  Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,
514	saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to
514	resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.
514	""
514	Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted
514	the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.
514	Laurence went home to rest.  The others sat round the fire, talking
514	away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal
514	mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of
514	bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of
514	matches, made a move to go.
514	""
514	"""We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together"
514	"again once more,"" said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe"
514	and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.
514	""
514	They were not all there.  But no one found the words thoughtless or
514	untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,
514	invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the
514	household league that love made dissoluble.  The little chair stood in
514	its old place.  The tidy basket, with the bit of work she left
514	unfinished when the needle grew 'so heavy', was still on its accustomed
514	shelf.  The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved,
514	and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days,
514	"looked down upon them, seeming to say, ""Be happy.  I am here."""
514	""
514	"""Play something, Amy.  Let them hear how much you have improved,"" said"
514	Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.
514	""
514	"But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, ""Not"
514	"tonight, dear.  I can't show off tonight."""
514	""
514	But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she
514	sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best
514	master could not have taught, and touched the listener's hearts with a
514	sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her.  The
514	room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last
514	line of Beth's favorite hymn.  It was hard to say...
514	""
514	    Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;
514	""
514	and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that
514	her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.
514	""
514	"""Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that,"""
514	said Jo, before the pause grew painful.  And Mr. Bhaer cleared his
514	"throat with a gratified ""Hem!"" as he stepped into the corner where Jo"
514	stood, saying...
514	""
514	"""You will sing with me?  We go excellently well together."""
514	""
514	A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a
514	grasshopper.  But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a
514	whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.
514	It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily
514	and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might
514	listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.
514	""
514	    Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,
514	""
514	used to be the Professor's favorite line, for 'das land' meant Germany
514	to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,
514	upon the words...
514	""
514	    There, oh there, might I with thee,
514	    O, my beloved, go
514	""
514	and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she
514	longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither
514	whenever he liked.
514	""
514	The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered
514	with laurels.  But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners
514	entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she had been
514	introduced simply as 'my sister', and no one had called her by her new
514	name since he came.  He forgot himself still further when Laurie said,
514	in his most gracious manner, at parting...
514	""
514	"""My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir.  Please remember that"
514	"there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way."""
514	""
514	Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly
514	illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most
514	delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.
514	""
514	"""I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me"
514	leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here
514	"some days."""
514	""
514	He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother's voice
514	gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes, for Mrs. March
514	was not so blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.
514	""
514	"""I suspect that is a wise man,"" remarked Mr. March, with placid"
514	satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone.
514	""
514	"""I know he is a good one,"" added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as"
514	she wound up the clock.
514	""
514	"""I thought you'd like him,"" was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her"
514	bed.
514	""
514	She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,
514	and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor,
514	somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact.  If she had
514	seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a
514	severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to
514	be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon
514	the subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the
514	picture in the dark.

514	MY LORD AND LADY
514	""
514	"""Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour?  The"
514	luggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris finery,
514	"trying to find some things I want,"" said Laurie, coming in the next day"
514	to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap, as if being made
514	'the baby' again.
514	""
514	"""Certainly.  Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this,"" and"
514	Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring, as if
514	asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.
514	""
514	"""I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it, but I can't get"
514	"on without my little woman any more than a..."""
514	""
514	"""Weathercock can without the wind,"" suggested Jo, as he paused for a"
514	simile.  Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came
514	home.
514	""
514	"""Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with"
514	only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven't had an
514	easterly spell since I was married.  Don't know anything about the
514	"north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?"""
514	""
514	"""Lovely weather so far.  I don't know how long it will last, but I'm"
514	not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship.  Come home,
514	dear, and I'll find your bootjack.  I suppose that's what you are
514	"rummaging after among my things.  Men are so helpless, Mother,"" said"
514	Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her husband.
514	""
514	"""What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?"" asked"
514	Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.
514	""
514	"""We have our plans.  We don't mean to say much about them yet, because"
514	we are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be idle.  I'm going
514	into business with a devotion that shall delight Grandfather, and prove
514	to him that I'm not spoiled.  I need something of the sort to keep me
514	"steady.  I'm tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man."""
514	""
514	"""And Amy, what is she going to do?"" asked Mrs. March, well pleased at"
514	Laurie's decision and the energy with which he spoke.
514	""
514	"""After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall"
514	astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant
514	society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall
514	exert over the world at large.  That's about it, isn't it, Madame
514	"Recamier?"" asked Laurie with a quizzical look at Amy."
514	""
514	"""Time will show.  Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock my family by"
514	"calling me names before their faces,"" answered Amy, resolving that"
514	there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon
514	as a queen of society.
514	""
514	"""How happy those children seem together!"" observed Mr. March, finding"
514	it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple
514	had gone.
514	""
514	"""Yes, and I think it will last,"" added Mrs. March, with the restful"
514	expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.
514	""
514	"""I know it will.  Happy Amy!"" and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as"
514	Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.
514	""
514	Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the
514	"bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, ""Mrs. Laurence."""
514	""
514	"""My Lord!"""
514	""
514	"""That man intends to marry our Jo!"""
514	""
514	"""I hope so, don't you, dear?"""
514	""
514	"""Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that"
514	expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal
514	"richer."""
514	""
514	"""Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love"
514	one another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.
514	"Women never should marry for money..."" Amy caught herself up short as"
514	the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with
514	malicious gravity...
514	""
514	"""Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend"
514	to do it sometimes.  If my memory serves me, you once thought it your
514	duty to make a rich match.  That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a
514	"good-for-nothing like me."""
514	""
514	"""Oh, my dearest boy, don't, don't say that!  I forgot you were rich"
514	when I said 'Yes'.  I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I
514	"sometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I love you."""
514	And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond in private,
514	gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.
514	""
514	"""You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be"
514	once, do you?  It would break my heart if you didn't believe that I'd
514	gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your
514	"living by rowing on the lake."""
514	""
514	"""Am I an idiot and a brute?  How could I think so, when you refused a"
514	richer man for me, and won't let me give you half I want to now, when I
514	have the right?  Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to
514	think it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and
514	though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the
514	daughter was true to the mother's teaching.  I told Mamma so yesterday,
514	and she looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her a check for a
514	million, to be spent in charity.  You are not listening to my moral
514	"remarks, Mrs. Laurence,"" and Laurie paused, for Amy's eyes had an"
514	absent look, though fixed upon his face.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time.  I"
514	don't wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I'm prouder of my
514	handsome husband than of all his money. Don't laugh, but your nose is
514	"such a comfort to me,"" and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature"
514	with artistic satisfaction.
514	""
514	Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that
514	suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his
514	"wife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly, ""May I ask you a"
514	"question, dear?"""
514	""
514	"""Of course, you may."""
514	""
514	"""Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?"""
514	""
514	"""Oh, that's the trouble is it?  I thought there was something in the"
514	dimple that didn't quite suit you.  Not being a dog in the manger, but
514	the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo's wedding
514	"with a heart as light as my heels.  Do you doubt it, my darling?"""
514	""
514	Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied.  Her little jealous fear
514	vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and
514	confidence.
514	""
514	"""I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn't"
514	we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in
514	"Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?"" said Laurie, when they"
514	began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they
514	were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.
514	""
514	"""Jo would find us out, and spoil it all.  She is very proud of him,"
514	just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a
514	"beautiful thing."""
514	""
514	"""Bless her dear heart!  She won't think so when she has a literary"
514	husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support.  We
514	won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in
514	spite of themselves.  I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she
514	believes in people's paying their honest debts, so I'll get round her
514	"in that way."""
514	""
514	"""How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it? That was"
514	always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely, and thanks
514	"to you, the dream has come true."""
514	""
514	"""Ah, we'll do quantities of good, won't we?  There's one sort of"
514	poverty that I particularly like to help.  Out-and-out beggars get
514	taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won't
514	ask, and people don't dare to offer charity. Yet there are a thousand
514	ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that
514	it does not offend.  I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman
514	better than a blarnerying beggar.  I suppose it's wrong, but I do,
514	"though it is harder."""
514	""
514	"""Because it takes a gentleman to do it,"" added the other member of the"
514	domestic admiration society.
514	""
514	"""Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment. But I"
514	was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good
514	many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and
514	enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid
514	fellows, some of them, working like heros,  poor and friendless, but so
514	full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself,
514	and longed to give them a right good lift.  Those are people whom it's
514	a satisfaction to help, for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be
514	allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of
514	fuel to keep the pot boiling.  If they haven't, it's a pleasure to
514	comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it
514	"out."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, indeed, and there's another class who can't ask, and who suffer"
514	in silence.  I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you
514	made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid in the old
514	story.  Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see
514	youth, health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a
514	little help at the right minute.  People have been very kind to me, and
514	whenever I see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put
514	"out my hand and help them, as I was helped."""
514	""
514	"""And so you shall, like an angel as you are!"" cried Laurie, resolving,"
514	with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution
514	"for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies.  ""Rich"
514	people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their
514	money accumulate for others to waste.  It's not half so sensible to
514	leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while
514	alive, and enjoy making one's fellow creatures happy with it.  We'll
514	have a good time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure
514	by giving other people a generous taste.  Will you be a little Dorcas,
514	going about emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with
514	"good deeds?"""
514	""
514	"""With all my heart, if you will be a brave St.  Martin, stopping as you"
514	"ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar."""
514	""
514	"""It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!"""
514	""
514	So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again,
514	feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped
514	to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more
514	uprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough
514	ways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely
514	knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest
514	than they.
514	""
514	""
514	""
514	CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE
514	""
514	DAISY AND DEMI
514	""
514	I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March
514	family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious
514	and important members of it.  Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years
514	of discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or four assert
514	their rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their
514	elders do.  If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being
514	utterly spoiled by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes.  Of
514	course they were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be
514	shown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently
514	at twelve months, and at two years they took their places at table, and
514	behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy
514	demanded a 'needler', and actually made a bag with four stitches in it.
514	She likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a
514	microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to
514	Hannah's eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who
514	invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with
514	his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels.  The boy
514	early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and
514	distracted his mother, for he tried to imitate every machine he saw,
514	and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his 'sewinsheen', a
514	mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for
514	wheels to go 'wound and wound'.  Also a basket hung over the back of a
514	chair, in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who,
514	with feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till
514	"rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, ""Why, Marmar,"
514	"dat's my lellywaiter, and me's trying to pull her up."""
514	""
514	Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well
514	together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day.  Of course, Demi
514	tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other
514	aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her
514	brother as the one perfect being in the world.  A rosy, chubby,
514	sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart,
514	and nestled there.  One of the captivating children, who seem made to
514	be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and
514	produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small
514	virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few
514	small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human.  It was all
514	fair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the
514	window in her little nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether
514	"it rained or shone, ""Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!"" Everyone was a"
514	friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the
514	most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful
514	worshipers.
514	""
514	"""Me loves evvybody,"" she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in"
514	one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish
514	the whole world.
514	""
514	As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be
514	blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which
514	had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be
514	spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had
514	entertained an angel unawares.  Her grandfather often called her
514	'Beth', and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as
514	if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own
514	could see.
514	""
514	Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know
514	everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get
514	"satisfactory answers to his perpetual ""What for?"""
514	""
514	He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his
514	grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which
514	the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised
514	satisfaction of the womenfolk.
514	""
514	"""What makes my legs go, Dranpa?"" asked the young philosopher, surveying"
514	those active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting
514	after a go-to-bed frolic one night.
514	""
514	"""It's your little mind, Demi,"" replied the sage, stroking the yellow"
514	head respectfully.
514	""
514	"""What is a little mine?"""
514	""
514	"""It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the"
514	"wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you."""
514	""
514	"""Open me.  I want to see it go wound."""
514	""
514	"""I can't do that any more than you could open the watch.  God winds you"
514	"up, and you go till He stops you."""
514	""
514	"""Does I?"" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the"
514	"new thought.  ""Is I wounded up like the watch?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't see."""
514	""
514	Demi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the watch,
514	"and then gravely remarked, ""I dess Dod does it when I's asleep."""
514	""
514	A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively
514	"that his anxious grandmother said, ""My dear, do you think it wise to"
514	talk about such things to that baby?  He's getting great bumps over his
514	"eyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions."""
514	""
514	"""If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive"
514	true answers.  I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping
514	him unfold those already there.  These children are wiser than we are,
514	and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him.
514	"Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind."""
514	""
514	"If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, ""By the gods, Socrates, I"
514	"cannot tell,"" his grandfather would not have been surprised, but when,"
514	after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he
514	"answered, in a tone of calm conviction, ""In my little belly,"" the old"
514	gentleman could only join in Grandma's laugh, and dismiss the class in
514	metaphysics.
514	""
514	There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given
514	convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a budding
514	philosopher, for often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to
514	"prophesy, with ominous nods, ""That child ain't long for this world,"" he"
514	would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with
514	which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight their
514	parent's souls.
514	""
514	Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what mother was
514	ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, or the
514	tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show
514	themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?
514	""
514	"""No more raisins, Demi.  They'll make you sick,"" says Mamma to the"
514	young person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing
514	regularity on plum-pudding day.
514	""
514	"""Me likes to be sick."""
514	""
514	"""I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty cakes."""
514	""
514	He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit, and
514	by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits Mamma
514	by a shrewd bargain.
514	""
514	"""Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you like,"""
514	says Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding
514	is safely bouncing in the pot.
514	""
514	"""Truly, Marmar?"" asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered"
514	head.
514	""
514	"""Yes, truly.  Anything you say,"" replies the shortsighted parent,"
514	"preparing herself to sing, ""The Three Little Kittens"" half a dozen"
514	"times over, or to take her family to ""Buy a penny bun,"" regardless of"
514	wind or limb.  But Demi corners her by the cool reply...
514	""
514	"""Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins."""
514	""
514	Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children, and the
514	trio turned the little house topsy-turvy.  Aunt Amy was as yet only a
514	name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but
514	Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for
514	which compliment she was deeply grateful.  But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo
514	neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their
514	little souls.  Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost
514	her best customer and became bankrupt.  Demi, with infantile
514	penetration, soon discovered that Dodo like to play with 'the bear-man'
514	better than she did him, but though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for
514	he hadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate
514	drops in his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of
514	its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.
514	""
514	Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes,
514	but Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to patronize the
514	'the bear-man' with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small
514	affections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her
514	throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures surpassing worth.
514	""
514	Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the
514	young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, but this
514	counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not
514	deceive anybody a particle.  Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however
514	likewise effective--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law.
514	He was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked
514	particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his
514	manly one.  His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to
514	day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always
514	asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction.  The excellent
514	papa labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled in long
514	discussions with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more
514	observing grandson suddenly enlightened him.
514	""
514	Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,
514	astonished by the spectacle that met his eye.  Prone upon the floor lay
514	Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him,
514	likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own
514	short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers so seriously absorbed
514	that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his
514	sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face...
514	""
514	"""Father, Father, here's the Professor!"""
514	""
514	Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor
514	"said, with undisturbed dignity, ""Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for"
514	a moment.  We are just finishing our lesson.  Now, Demi, make the
514	"letter and tell its name."""
514	""
514	"""I knows him!"" and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took"
514	the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil
514	"triumphantly shouted, ""It's a We, Dranpa, it's a We!"""
514	""
514	"""He's a born Weller,"" laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself up,"
514	and her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only mode of
514	expressing his satisfaction that school was over.
514	""
514	"""What have you been at today, bubchen?"" asked Mr. Bhaer, picking up the"
514	gymnast.
514	""
514	"""Me went to see little Mary."""
514	""
514	"""And what did you there?"""
514	""
514	"""I kissed her,"" began Demi, with artless frankness."
514	""
514	"""Prut!  Thou beginnest early.  What did the little Mary say to that?"""
514	asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon
514	the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.
514	""
514	"""Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it.  Don't little"
514	"boys like little girls?"" asked Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of"
514	bland satisfaction.
514	""
514	"""You precocious chick!  Who put that into your head?"" said Jo, enjoying"
514	the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.
514	""
514	"""'Tisn't in mine head, it's in mine mouf,"" answered literal Demi,"
514	putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking she
514	alluded to confectionery, not ideas.
514	""
514	"""Thou shouldst save some for the little friend.  Sweets to the sweet,"
514	"mannling,"" and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her"
514	wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods.  Demi also
514	saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy inquired.  ..
514	""
514	"""Do great boys like great girls, to, 'Fessor?"""
514	""
514	Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer 'couldn't tell a lie', so he gave the
514	somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone
514	that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush, glance at Jo's retiring
514	face, and then sink into his chair, looking as if the 'precocious
514	chick' had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour.
514	""
514	Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour
514	afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a
514	tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she
514	followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big
514	slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi
514	puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.

514	CHAPTER FORTY-SIX
514	""
514	UNDER THE UMBRELLA
514	""
514	While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets,
514	as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, Mr.
514	Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy
514	roads and sodden fields.
514	""
514	"""I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know why I should"
514	give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor on his way
514	"out,"" said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters, for though"
514	there were two paths to Meg's whichever one she took she was sure to
514	meet him, either going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and
514	never seemed to see her until quite close, when he would look as if his
514	short-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till
514	that moment.  Then, if she was going to Meg's he always had something
514	for the babies.  If her face was turned homeward, he had merely
514	strolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless they
514	were tired of his frequent calls.
514	""
514	Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and
514	invite him in?  If she was tired of his visits, she concealed her
514	weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee
514	"for supper, ""as Friedrich--I mean Mr. Bhaer--doesn't like tea."""
514	""
514	By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going on, yet
514	everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in
514	Jo's face.  They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her
514	hair three times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise.
514	And no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer,
514	while talking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter
514	lessons in love.
514	""
514	Jo couldn't even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried
514	to quench her feelings, and failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated
514	life.  She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering,
514	after her many and vehement declarations of independence.  Laurie was
514	her especial dread, but thanks to the new manager, he behaved with
514	praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer 'a capital old fellow'
514	in public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo's improved
514	appearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor's
514	hat on the Marches' table nearly every evening.  But he exulted in
514	private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece
514	of plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat
514	of arms.
514	""
514	For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like
514	regularity.  Then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no
514	sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to
514	become pensive, at first, and then--alas for romance--very cross.
514	""
514	"""Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It's"
514	nothing to me, of course, but I should think he would have come and bid
514	"us goodbye like a gentleman,"" she said to herself, with a despairing"
514	look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary walk one
514	dull afternoon.
514	""
514	"""You'd better take the little umbrella, dear.  It looks like rain,"""
514	said her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not
514	alluding to the fact.
514	""
514	"""Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town?  I've got to run in and get"
514	"some paper,"" returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the"
514	glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.
514	""
514	"""Yes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and"
514	two yards of narrow lavender ribbon.  Have you got your thick boots on,
514	"and something warm under your cloak?"""
514	""
514	"""I believe so,"" answered Jo absently."
514	""
514	"""If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long"
514	"to see the dear man,"" added Mrs. March."
514	""
514	Jo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk
514	rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her
514	"heartache, ""How good she is to me! What do girls do who haven't any"
514	"mothers to help them through their troubles?"""
514	""
514	The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks,
514	and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate, but Jo
514	found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand,
514	loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining engineering
514	instruments in one window and samples of wool in another, with most
514	unfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered by
514	descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as
514	if they wondered 'how the deuce she got there'.  A drop of rain on her
514	cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons.  For
514	the drops continued to fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she
514	felt that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her
514	bonnet.  Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had
514	forgotten to take in her hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing,
514	and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching.  She
514	looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked
514	with black, forward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering
514	look behind, at a certain grimy warehouse, with 'Hoffmann, Swartz, &
514	Co.' over the door, and said to herself, with a sternly reproachful
514	air...
514	""
514	"""It serves me right! what business had I to put on all my best things"
514	and come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor?  Jo, I'm
514	ashamed of you!  No, you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella, or
514	find out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do
514	your errands in the rain, and if you catch your death and ruin your
514	"bonnet, it's no more than you deserve.  Now then!"""
514	""
514	With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly
514	escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself
514	"into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, ""I beg pardon,"
514	"ma'am,"" and looked mortally offended.  Somewhat daunted, Jo righted"
514	herself, spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and putting
514	temptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the
514	ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead.  The fact that a
514	somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected
514	bonnet attracted her attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer
514	looking down.
514	""
514	"""I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many"
514	horse noses, and so fast through much mud.  What do you down here, my
514	"friend?"""
514	""
514	"""I'm shopping."""
514	""
514	Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to
514	the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but he only said
514	"politely, ""You haf no umbrella.  May I go also, and take for you the"
514	"bundles?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, thank you."""
514	""
514	Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought
514	of her, but she didn't care, for in a minute she found herself walking
514	away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly
514	burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,
514	and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that
514	day.
514	""
514	"""We thought you had gone,"" said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking"
514	at her.  Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face, and she feared
514	he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.
514	""
514	"""Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf"
514	"been so heavenly kind to me?"" he asked so reproachfully that she felt"
514	as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered heartily...
514	""
514	"""No, I didn't.  I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we"
514	"rather missed you, Father and Mother especially."""
514	""
514	"""And you?"""
514	""
514	"""I'm always glad to see you, sir."""
514	""
514	In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool,
514	and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the
514	Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely...
514	""
514	"""I thank you, and come one more time before I go."""
514	""
514	"""You are going, then?"""
514	""
514	"""I haf no longer any business here, it is done."""
514	""
514	"""Successfully, I hope?"" said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment"
514	was in that short reply of his.
514	""
514	"""I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make"
514	"my bread and gif my Junglings much help."""
514	""
514	"""Tell me, please!  I like to know all about the--the boys,"" said Jo"
514	eagerly.
514	""
514	"""That is so kind, I gladly tell you.  My friends find for me a place in"
514	a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way
514	smooth for Franz and Emil.  For this I should be grateful, should I
514	"not?"""
514	""
514	"""Indeed you should.  How splendid it will be to have you doing what you"
514	"like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!"" cried Jo, clinging"
514	to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help
514	betraying.
514	""
514	"""Ah!  But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West."""
514	""
514	"""So far away!"" and Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn't"
514	matter now what became of her clothes or herself.
514	""
514	Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read
514	women yet.  He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, and was,
514	therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and
514	manner, which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was
514	in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour.  When
514	she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help
514	suspecting that she had come for that express purpose.  When he offered
514	her his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but
514	when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply
514	that despair fell upon him.  On learning his good fortune she almost
514	clapped her hands.  Was the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his
514	"destination, she said, ""So far away!"" in a tone of despair that lifted"
514	him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down
514	again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter...
514	""
514	"""Here's the place for my errands.  Will you come in? It won't take"
514	"long."""
514	""
514	Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and
514	particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and
514	dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to the
514	flutter she was in, everything went amiss. She upset the tray of
514	needles, forgot the silesia was to be 'twilled' till it was cut off,
514	gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for
514	lavender ribbon at the calico counter.  Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching
514	her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed
514	to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, women,
514	like dreams, go by contraries.
514	""
514	When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more
514	cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather
514	enjoyed it on the whole.
514	""
514	"""Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and"
514	haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your so
514	"pleasant home?"" he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and"
514	flowers.
514	""
514	"""What will we buy?"" asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech,"
514	and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they
514	went in.
514	""
514	"""May they haf oranges and figs?"" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air."
514	""
514	"""They eat them when they can get them."""
514	""
514	"""Do you care for nuts?"""
514	""
514	"""Like a squirrel."""
514	""
514	"""Hamburg grapes.  Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those?"""
514	""
514	Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn't buy
514	a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and be done
514	with it?  Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own,
514	and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of
514	rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of
514	a demijohn.  Then distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and
514	giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they
514	traveled on again.
514	""
514	"""Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,"" began the Professor,"
514	after a moist promenade of half a block.
514	""
514	"""Yes, sir?"" and Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he"
514	would hear it.
514	""
514	"""I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time"
514	"remains to me."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, sir,"" and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden"
514	squeeze she gave it.
514	""
514	"""I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go"
514	"alone.  Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, sir,"" and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had"
514	stepped into a refrigerator.
514	""
514	"""Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick, and"
514	the husband is such a care.  Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a
514	"friendly thing to take the little mother."""
514	""
514	"""I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.""  ""I'm going very fast, and he's"
514	"getting dearer every minute,"" added Jo to herself, then with a mental"
514	shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to
514	behold.
514	""
514	Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and
514	then ordered out the shawls.  The clerk, being a married man,
514	condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be
514	shopping for their family.
514	""
514	"""Your lady may prefer this.  It's a superior article, a most desirable"
514	"color, quite chaste and genteel,"" he said, shaking out a comfortable"
514	gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.
514	""
514	"""Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?"" she asked, turning her back to him,"
514	and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.
514	""
514	"""Excellently well, we will haf it,"" answered the Professor, smiling to"
514	himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters
514	like a confirmed bargain-hunter.
514	""
514	"""Now shall we go home?"" he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to"
514	him.
514	""
514	"""Yes, it's late, and I'm _so_ tired."" Jo's voice was more pathetic than"
514	she knew.  For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it
514	came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the
514	first time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and
514	that her heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the
514	latter.  Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a friend,
514	it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better.  With this
514	idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty
514	gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.
514	""
514	"""This is not our omniboos,"" said the Professor, waving the loaded"
514	vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.
514	""
514	"""I beg your pardon.  I didn't see the name distinctly.  Never mind, I"
514	"can walk.  I'm used to plodding in the mud,"" returned Jo, winking hard,"
514	because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.
514	""
514	Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away.
514	The sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly stooping down, he
514	"asked in a tone that meant a great deal, ""Heart's dearest, why do you"
514	"cry?"""
514	""
514	Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said
514	she wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine
514	fib proper to the occasion.  Instead of which, that undignified
514	"creature answered, with an irrepressible sob, ""Because you are going"
514	"away."""
514	""
514	"""Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!"" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp"
514	"his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, ""Jo, I haf nothing"
514	but much love to gif you.  I came to see if you could care for it, and
514	I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend.  Am I?
514	"Can you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?"" he added, all"
514	in one breath.
514	""
514	"""Oh, yes!"" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both"
514	hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that
514	plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him,
514	even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he
514	carried it.
514	""
514	It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had
514	desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on
514	account of the mud.  Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except
514	figuratively, for both were full.  Much less could he indulge in tender
514	remonstrations in the open street, though he was near it.  So the only
514	way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an
514	expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there
514	actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his
514	beard.  If he had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have
514	done it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a
514	deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her
514	bonnet a ruin.  Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most
514	"beautiful woman living, and she found him more ""Jove-like"" than ever,"
514	though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling
514	thence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and
514	every finger of his gloves needed mending.
514	""
514	Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they
514	entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious
514	of deepening dusk and fog.  Little they cared what anybody thought, for
514	they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any
514	life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the
514	plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of
514	heaven. The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the
514	world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss.  While Jo
514	trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and
514	wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot.  Of course, she
514	was the first to speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks
514	"which followed her impetuous ""Oh, yes!"" were not of a coherent or"
514	reportable character.
514	""
514	"""Friedrich, why didn't you..."""
514	""
514	"""Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!"""
514	cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful
514	delight.
514	""
514	"""I always call you so to myself--I forgot, but I won't unless you like"
514	"it."""
514	""
514	"""Like it?  It is more sweet to me than I can tell.  Say 'thou', also,"
514	"and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine."""
514	""
514	"""Isn't 'thou' a little sentimental?"" asked Jo, privately thinking it a"
514	lovely monosyllable.
514	""
514	"""Sentimental? Yes.  Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and"
514	keep ourselves young mit it.  Your English 'you' is so cold, say
514	"'thou', heart's dearest, it means so much to me,"" pleaded Mr. Bhaer,"
514	more like a romantic student than a grave professor.
514	""
514	"""Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?"" asked Jo"
514	bashfully.
514	""
514	"""Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will,"
514	because thou must take care of it hereafter.  See, then, my Jo--ah, the
514	dear, funny little name--I had a wish to tell something the day I said
514	goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to
514	thee, and so I spoke not.  Wouldst thou have said 'Yes', then, if I had
514	"spoken?"""
514	""
514	"""I don't know.  I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart just then."""
514	""
514	"""Prut!  That I do not believe.  It was asleep till the fairy prince"
514	came through the wood, and waked it up.  Ah, well, 'Die erste Liebe ist
514	"die beste', but that I should not expect."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I never had"
514	"another.  Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his little fancy,"""
514	said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor's mistake.
514	""
514	"""Good!  Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all."
514	I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find,
514	"Professorin."""
514	""
514	"""I like that,"" cried Jo, delighted with her new name.  ""Now tell me"
514	"what brought you, at last, just when I wanted you?"""
514	""
514	"""This,"" and Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat"
514	pocket.
514	""
514	Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her own
514	contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which accounted for her
514	sending it an occasional attempt.
514	""
514	"""How could that bring you?"" she asked, wondering what he meant."
514	""
514	"""I found it by chance.  I knew it by the names and the initials, and in"
514	it there was one little verse that seemed to call me.  Read and find
514	"him.  I will see that you go not in the wet."""

514	    By children now in their prime.
514	    Four little keys hung side by side,
514	    With faded ribbons, brave and gay
514	    When fastened there, with childish pride,
514	    Long ago, on a rainy day.
514	    Four little names, one on each lid,
514	    Carved out by a boyish hand,
514	    And underneath there lieth hid
514	    Histories of the happy band
514	    Once playing here, and pausing oft
514	    To hear the sweet refrain,

514	    The record of a peaceful life--
514	    Gifts to gentle child and girl,
514	    A bridal gown, lines to a wife,
514	    A tiny shoe, a baby curl.
514	    No toys in this first chest remain,
514	    For all are carried away,
514	    In their old age, to join again
514	    In another small Meg's play.

514	    Spoils brought home from the fairy ground
514	    Only trod by youthful feet,
514	    Dreams of a future never found,
514	    Memories of a past still sweet,
514	    Half-writ poems, stories wild,
514	    April letters, warm and cold,
514	    Diaries of a wilful child,

514	    Four sisters, parted for an hour,

514	    Made by love's immortal power,
514	    Nearest and dearest evermore.

514	"""It's very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day when I"

514	"""Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I"
514	"read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets,"" said"
514	Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the
514	"wind.  ""Yes,"" he added earnestly, ""I read that, and I think to myself,"
514	She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love.
514	I haf a heart full, full for her.  Shall I not go and say, 'If this is
514	not too poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive, take it

514	nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he
514	was to surmount or valiantly knock down.
514	""
514	Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight,
514	though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.
514	""
514	"""What made you stay away so long?"" she asked presently, finding it so"
514	pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that
514	she could not keep silent.
514	""
514	"""It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that"
514	so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to gif you, after
514	much time, perhaps, and hard work.  How could I ask you to gif up so
514	"much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?"""
514	""
514	"""I'm glad you are poor.  I couldn't bear a rich husband,"" said Jo"
514	"decidedly, adding in a softer tone, ""Don't fear poverty. I've known it"
514	long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those I love, and
514	don't call yourself old--forty is the prime of life.  I couldn't help
514	"loving you if you were seventy!"""
514	""
514	The Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of
514	his handkerchief, if he could have got at it.  As he couldn't, Jo wiped
514	his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away a bundle or
514	two...
514	""
514	"""I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my sphere now,"
514	for woman's special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing
514	burdens.  I'm to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn the home.
514	"Make up your mind to that, or I'll never go,"" she added resolutely, as"
514	he tried to reclaim his load.
514	""
514	"""We shall see.  Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go"
514	away and do my work alone.  I must help my boys first, because, even
514	for you, I may not break my word to Minna.  Can you forgif that, and be
514	"happy while we hope and wait?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes all the"

514	myself if I neglected them even for you, so there's no need of hurry or
514	impatience.  You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and
514	both be happy hoping for the best, and leaving the future to be as God

514	"""Ah! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing to gif"

514	Jo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said that as they
514	stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, whispering
514	"tenderly, ""Not empty now,"" and stooping down, kissed her Friedrich"
514	under the umbrella.  It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the
514	flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings,
514	for she was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything
514	but her own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that
514	was the crowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the
514	night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and

514	HARVEST TIME
514	""
514	For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met
514	occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the
514	price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said.  The second year began
514	rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March
514	died suddenly.  But when their first sorrow was over--for they loved
514	the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue--they found they had cause
514	for rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts
514	of joyful things possible.
514	""
514	"""It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of course"
514	"you intend to sell it,"" said Laurie, as they were all talking the"
514	matter over some weeks later.
514	""
514	"""No, I don't,"" was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle,"
514	whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.
514	""
514	"""You don't mean to live there?"""
514	""
514	"""Yes, I do."""
514	""
514	"""But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power of"
514	money to keep it in order.  The garden and orchard alone need two or
514	"three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it."""
514	""
514	"""He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it."""
514	""
514	"""And you expect to live on the produce of the place?  Well, that sounds"
514	"paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work."""
514	""
514	"""The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one,"" and Jo laughed."
514	""
514	"""Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?"""
514	""
514	"""Boys.  I want to open a school for little lads--a good, happy,"
514	"homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach them."""
514	""
514	"""That's a truly Joian plan for you!  Isn't that just like her?"" cried"
514	Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.
514	""
514	"""I like it,"" said Mrs. March decidedly."
514	""
514	"""So do I,"" added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for"
514	trying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.
514	""
514	"""It will be an immense care for Jo,"" said Meg, stroking the head of her"
514	one all-absorbing son.
514	""
514	"""Jo can do it, and be happy in it.  It's a splendid idea. Tell us all"
514	"about it,"" cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers"
514	a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.
514	""
514	"""I knew you'd stand by me, sir.  Amy does too--I see it in her eyes,"
514	though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she
514	"speaks.  Now, my dear people,"" continued Jo earnestly, ""just understand"
514	that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long cherished plan.  Before
514	my Fritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my fortune, and no
514	one needed me at home, I'd hire a big house, and pick up some poor,
514	forlorn little lads who hadn't any mothers, and take care of them, and
514	make life jolly for them before it was too late.  I see so many going
514	to ruin for want of help at the right minute, I love so to do anything
514	for them, I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their
514	"troubles, and oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!"""
514	""
514	Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in
514	her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not
514	seen for a long while.
514	""
514	"""I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would"
514	like, and agreed to try it when we got rich.  Bless his dear heart,
514	he's been doing it all his life--helping poor boys, I mean, not getting
514	rich, that he'll never be.  Money doesn't stay in his pocket long
514	enough to lay up any.  But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved
514	me better than I ever deserved, I'm rich, at least I feel so, and we
514	can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school.
514	It's just the place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture
514	strong and plain.  There's plenty of room for dozens inside, and
514	splendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard.
514	Such work is healthy, isn't it, sir?  Then Fritz could train and teach
514	in his own way, and Father will help him.  I can feed and nurse and pet
514	and scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by.  I've always longed for
514	lots of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and
514	revel in the little dears to my heart's content.  Think what luxury--
514	"Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me."""
514	""
514	As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off
514	into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought
514	he'd have an apoplectic fit.
514	""
514	"""I don't see anything funny,"" she said gravely, when she could be"
514	"heard.  ""Nothing could be more natural and proper than for my Professor"
514	"to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate."""
514	""
514	"""She is putting on airs already,"" said Laurie, who regarded the idea in"
514	"the light of a capital joke.  ""But may I inquire how you intend to"
514	support the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins,
514	I'm afraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs.
514	"Bhaer."""
514	""
514	"""Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy.  Of course I shall have rich"
514	pupils, also--perhaps begin with such altogether.  Then, when I've got
514	a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich
514	people's children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've
514	seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones
514	pushed forward, when it's real cruelty.  Some are naughty through
514	mismanagment or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best
514	have to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they
514	need most patience and kindness.  People laugh at them, and hustle them
514	about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at
514	once from pretty children into fine young men.  They don't complain
514	much--plucky little souls--but they feel it.  I've been through
514	something of it, and I know all about it. I've a special interest in
514	such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest,
514	well-meaning boys' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the
514	topsy-turvy heads.  I've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up
514	"one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?"""
514	""
514	"""I'll testify that you tried to do it,"" said Laurie with a grateful"
514	look.
514	""
514	"""And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady,"
514	sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying
514	up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not
514	merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them
514	yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times.
514	I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone
514	feels it, though you won't let them say so.  Yes, and when I have my
514	"flock, I'll just point to you, and say 'There's your model, my lads'."""
514	""
514	Poor Laurie didn't know where to look, for, man though he was,
514	something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise
514	made all faces turn approvingly upon him.
514	""
514	"""I say, Jo, that's rather too much,"" he began, just in his old boyish"
514	"way.  ""You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,"
514	except by doing my best not to disappoint you.  You have rather cast me
514	off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless.  So, if
514	"I've got on at all, you may thank these two for it,"" and he laid one"
514	hand gently on his grandfather's head, and the other on Amy's golden
514	one, for the three were never far apart.
514	""
514	"""I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the"
514	"world!"" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame of mind"
514	"just then.  ""When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as"
514	the three I know and love the best.  If John and my Fritz were only
514	"here, it would be quite a little heaven on earth,"" she added more"
514	quietly.  And that night when she went to her room after a blissful
514	evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of
514	happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed
514	always near her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.
514	""
514	It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen
514	in an unusually rapid and delightful manner.  Almost before she knew
514	where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield.  Then
514	a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished
514	surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for Mr. Laurence was
514	continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the
514	Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for
514	its support.  In this way, the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo,
514	and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.
514	""
514	Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, but
514	the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most
514	rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her
514	'wilderness of boys', and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented
514	had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered
514	Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys!  There was a sort of
514	poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the
514	terror of the boys for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely
514	on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved,
514	and played cricket in the big field where the irritable 'cow with a
514	crumpled horn' used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed.  It
514	became a sort of boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be
514	called the 'Bhaer-garten', as a compliment to its master and
514	appropriate to its inhabitants.
514	""
514	It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a
514	fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be--'a happy, homelike
514	place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness'.  Every room
514	in the big house was soon full.  Every little plot in the garden soon
514	had its owner.  A regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet
514	animals were allowed. And three times a day, Jo smiled at her Fritz
514	from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy
514	young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding
514	words, and grateful hearts, full of love for 'Mother Bhaer'.  She had
514	boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not angels,
514	by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and Professorin
514	much trouble and anxiety.  But her faith in the good spot which exists
514	in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little
514	ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal
514	boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as
514	benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times
514	seven.  Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads, their
514	penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing, their droll or touching
514	little confidences, their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even
514	their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more.
514	There were slow boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys,
514	boys that lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a
514	merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was
514	welcome to the 'Bhaer-garten', though some people predicted that his
514	admission would ruin the school.
514	""
514	Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much
514	anxiety, and a perpetual racket.  She enjoyed it heartily and found the
514	applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world, for
514	now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers
514	and admirers.  As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to
514	increase her happiness--Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a
514	happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa's sunshiny
514	temper as well as his mother's lively spirit.  How they ever grew up
514	alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and
514	aunts, but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough
514	nurses loved and served them well.
514	""
514	There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most
514	delightful was the yearly apple-picking.  For then the Marches,
514	Laurences, Brookes and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day
514	of it.  Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals
514	occurred, a mellow October day, when the air was full of an
514	exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance
514	healthily in the veins.  The old orchard wore its holiday attire.
514	Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped
514	briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a
514	feast.  Squirrels were busy with their small harvesting.  Birds
514	twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every tree
514	stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the
514	first shake.  Everybody was there. Everybody laughed and sang, climbed
514	up and tumbled down.  Everybody declared that there never had been such
514	a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave
514	themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there
514	were no such things as care or sorrow in the world.
514	""
514	Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and
514	Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying...
514	""
514	The gentle apple's winey juice.
514	""
514	The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout
514	Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made
514	a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the
514	way of ground and lofty tumbling.  Laurie devoted himself to the little
514	ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among
514	the bird's nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck.
514	Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas,
514	sorting the contributions that kept pouring in, while Amy with a
514	beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups,
514	and watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little
514	crutch beside him.
514	""
514	Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned
514	up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her
514	arm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up.  Little Teddy
514	bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never
514	felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad,
514	galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by
514	his indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies
514	could digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and
514	their own small shoes.  She knew that little Ted would turn up again in
514	time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back
514	with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.
514	""
514	At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while
514	the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises.  Then Jo and
514	Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the
514	grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day.
514	The land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for
514	the lads were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of
514	refreshment as they liked--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the
514	boyish soul.  They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the
514	fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk
514	while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by
514	eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over
514	the field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of
514	bird.  The little girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among
514	the edibles at his own sweet will.
514	""
514	When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first
514	"regular toast, which was always drunk at such times--""Aunt March, God"
514	"bless her!""  A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot"
514	how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been
514	taught to keep her memory green.
514	""
514	"""Now, Grandma's sixtieth birthday!  Long life to her, with three times"
514	"three!"""
514	""
514	That was given with a will, as you may well believe, and the cheering
514	once begun, it was hard to stop it.  Everybody's health was proposed,
514	from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the
514	astonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search
514	of its young master.  Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented
514	the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were
514	transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow.  Funny presents,
514	some of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were
514	ornaments to Grandma's--for the children's gifts were all their own.
514	Every stitch Daisy's patient little fingers had put into the
514	handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to Mrs. March.
514	Demi's miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut,
514	Rob's footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was
514	soothing, and no page of the costly book Amy's child gave her was so
514	"fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, the words--""To dear"
514	"Grandma, from her little Beth."""
514	""
514	During the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared, and when
514	Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while
514	Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to
514	sing.  Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and
514	from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys
514	sang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie
514	set to music, and the Professor trained his lads to give with the best
514	effect.  This was something altogether new, and it proved a grand
514	success, for Mrs. March couldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on
514	shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz
514	and Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.
514	""
514	After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and
514	her daughters under the festival tree.
514	""
514	"""I don't think I ever ought to call myself 'unlucky Jo' again, when my"
514	"greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,"" said Mrs. Bhaer,"
514	taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which he was
514	rapturously churning.
514	""
514	"""And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long"
514	"ago.  Do you remember our castles in the air?"" asked Amy, smiling as"
514	she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.
514	""
514	"""Dear fellows!  It does my heart good to see them forget business and"
514	"frolic for a day,"" answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all"
514	"mankind.  ""Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems selfish,"
514	lonely, and cold to me now.  I haven't given up the hope that I may
514	write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it will be all the
514	"better for such experiences and illustrations as these,"" and Jo pointed"
514	from the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the
514	Professor's arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one
514	of the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her
514	mother, sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in
514	her lap and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face
514	which never could grow old to them.
514	""
514	"""My castle was the most nearly realized of all.  I asked for splendid"
514	things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I
514	had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these.  I've
514	"got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world,"" and"
514	Meg laid her hand on her tall boy's head, with a face full of tender
514	and devout content.
514	""
514	"""My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter"
514	it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic hopes, or
514	confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty.  I've
514	begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing
514	I've ever done.  I think so, myself, and mean to do it in marble, so
514	that, whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little
514	"angel."""
514	""
514	As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping
514	child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little
514	creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy's
514	sunshine.  This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for
514	one love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature was
514	growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender.  Laurie was growing more
514	serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that beauty, youth,
514	good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and
514	sorrow, from the most blessed for ...
514	""
514	""
514	    Into each life some rain must fall,
514	    Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.
514	""
514	""
514	"""She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear.  Don't despond, but"
514	"hope and keep happy,"" said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted Daisy stooped"
514	from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin's pale
514	one.
514	""
514	"""I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie"
514	"to take more than half of every burden,"" replied Amy warmly.  ""He never"
514	lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so
514	devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always that I can't
514	love him enough.  So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg,
514	"'Thank God, I'm a happy woman.'"""
514	""
514	"""There's no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that I'm far"
514	"happier than I deserve,"" added Jo, glancing from her good husband to"
514	"her chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her.  ""Fritz is"
514	getting gray and stout.  I'm growing as thin as a shadow, and am
514	thirty.  We never shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night,
514	for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under
514	the bed-clothes, though he's set himself afire three times already.
514	But in spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of,
514	and never was so jolly in my life.  Excuse the remark, but living among
514	"boys, I can't help using their expressions now and then."""
514	""
514	"""Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,"" began Mrs. March,"
514	frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of
514	countenance.
514	""
514	"""Not half so good as yours, Mother.  Here it is, and we never can thank"
514	"you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done,"" cried Jo,"
514	with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow.
514	""
514	"""I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year,"" said Amy"
514	softly.
514	""
514	"""A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for it, Marmee"
514	"dear,"" added Meg's tender voice."
514	""
514	Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if
514	to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and
514	voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility...
514	""
514	"""Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a"
514	"greater happiness than this!"""
