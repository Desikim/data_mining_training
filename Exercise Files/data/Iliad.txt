6150	PREFACE.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	In the spring of 1862 I was induced, at the request of some personal
6150	friends, to print, for private circulation only, a small volume of
6150	"""Translations of Poems Ancient and Modern,"" in which was included the"
6150	first Book of the Iliad. The opinions expressed by some competent
6150	"judges of the degree of success which had attended this ""attempt to"
6150	infuse into an almost literal English version something of the spirit,
6150	"as well as the simplicity, of the great original,"" [Footnote:"
6150	Introduction to unpublished volume.] were sufficiently favourable to
6150	encourage me to continue the work which I had begun. It has afforded
6150	me, in the intervals of more urgent business, an unfailing, and
6150	constantly increasing source of interest; and it is not without a
6150	feeling of regret at the completion of my task, and a sincere
6150	diffidence as to its success, that I venture to submit the result of my
6150	labour to the ordeal of public criticism.
6150	""
6150	Various causes, irrespective of any demerits of the work itself, forbid
6150	me to anticipate for this translation any extensive popularity. First,
6150	I fear that the taste for, and appreciation of, Classical Literature,
6150	are greatly on the decline; next, those who have kept up their
6150	classical studies, and are able to read and enjoy the original, will
6150	hardly take an interest in a mere translation; while the English
6150	reader, unacquainted with Greek, will naturally prefer the harmonious
6150	versification and polished brilliancy of Pope's translation; with
6150	which, as a happy adaptation of the Homeric story to the spirit of
6150	English poetry, I have not the presumption to enter into competition.
6150	But, admirable as it is, Pope's Iliad can hardly be said to be Homer's
6150	Iliad; and there may be some who, having lost the familiarity with the
6150	original language which they once possessed, may, if I have at all
6150	succeeded in my attempt, have recalled to their minds a faint echo of
6150	the strains which delighted their earlier days, and may recognize some
6150	slight trace of the original perfume.
6150	""
6150	Numerous as have been the translators of the Iliad, or of parts of it,
6150	the metres which have been selected have been almost as various: the
6150	ordinary couplet in rhyme, the Spenserian stanza, the Trochaic or
6150	"Ballad metre, all have had their partisans, even to that ""pestilent"
6150	"heresy"" of the so-called English Hexameter; a metre wholly repugnant to"
6150	the genius of our language; which can only be pressed into the service
6150	by a violation of every rule of prosody; and of which, notwithstanding
6150	my respect for the eminent men who have attempted to naturalize it, I
6150	could never read ten lines without being irresistibly reminded of
6150	Canning's
6150	""
6150	"   ""Dactylics call'st thou them? God help thee, silly one!"""
6150	""
6150	But in the progress of this work, I have been more and more confirmed
6150	in the opinion which I expressed at its commencement, that (whatever
6150	"may be the extent of my own individual failure) ""if justice is ever to"
6150	be done to the easy flow and majestic simplicity of the grand old Poet,
6150	"it can only be in the Heroic blank verse."" I have seen isolated"
6150	passages admirably rendered in other metres; and there are many
6150	instances in which a translation line for line and couplet for couplet
6150	naturally suggests itself, and in which it is sometimes difficult to
6150	avoid an involuntary rhyme; but the blank verse appears to me the only
6150	metre capable of adapting itself to all the gradations, if I may use
6150	the term, of the Homeric style; from the finished poetry of the
6150	numerous similes, in which every touch is nature, and nothing is
6150	overcoloured or exaggerated, down to the simple, almost homely, style
6150	of some portions of the narrative. Least of all can any other metre do
6150	full justice to the spirit and freedom of the various speeches, in
6150	which the old warriors give utterance, without disguise or restraint,
6150	to all their strong and genuine emotions. To subject these to the
6150	trammels of couplet and rhyme would be as destructive of their chief
6150	characteristics, as the application of a similar process to the
6150	Paradise Lost of Milton, or the tragedies of Shakespeare; the effect
6150	indeed may be seen by comparing, with some of the noblest speeches of
6150	the latter, the few couplets which he seems to have considered himself
6150	bound by custom to tack on to their close, at the end of a scene or an
6150	act.
6150	""
6150	I have adopted, not without hesitation, the Latin, rather than the
6150	Greek, nomenclature for the Heathen Deities. I have been induced to do
6150	so from the manifest incongruity of confounding the two; and from the
6150	fact that though English readers may be familiar with the names of
6150	Zeus, or Aphrodite, or even Poseidon, those of Hera, or Ares, or
6150	Hephaestus, or Leto, would hardly convey to them a definite
6150	signification.
6150	""
6150	It has been my aim throughout to produce a translation and not a
6150	paraphrase; not indeed such a translation as would satisfy, with regard
6150	to each word, the rigid requirements of accurate scholarship; but such
6150	as would fairly and honestly give the sense and spirit of every
6150	passage, and of every line; omitting nothing, and expanding nothing;
6150	and adhering, as closely as our language will allow, ever to every
6150	epithet which is capable of being translated, and which has, in the
6150	particular passage, anything of a special and distinctive character. Of
6150	the many deficiencies in my execution of this intention, I am but too
6150	conscious; whether I have been in any degree successful, must be left
6150	to the impartial decision of such of the Public as may honour this work
6150	with their perusal.

6150	NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.
6150	""
6150	The favourable reception which has been given to the first Editions of
6150	this work, far exceeding my most sanguine hopes, affords a gratifying
6150	proof how far, in my preface, I had overrated the extent to which the
6150	taste for, and appreciation of, Classical Literature had declined. It
6150	will not, I hope, be thought extraordinary that some errors and
6150	inaccuracies should have found their way into a translation executed, I
6150	"must admit, somewhat hastily, and with less of the ""limae labor"" than I"
6150	should have bestowed upon it, had I ventured to anticipate for it so
6150	extensive a circulation. My thanks, therefore, are due to those
6150	critics, who, either publicly or privately, have called my attention to
6150	passages in which the sense of the Author has been either incorrectly
6150	or imperfectly rendered. All of these I have examined, and have availed
6150	myself of several of the suggestions offered for their correction; and
6150	a careful revision of the whole work, and renewed comparison with the
6150	original, have enabled me to discover other defects, the removal of
6150	which will, I hope, render the present Edition, especially in the eyes
6150	of Classical Scholars, somewhat more worthy of the favour which has
6150	been  accorded to its predecessors.

6150	ARGUMENT.
6150	""
6150	THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring
6150	towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and
6150	Briseis, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles.
6150	Chryses, the father of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the
6150	Grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in
6150	the tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently
6150	dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god, who
6150	inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and
6150	encourages Calchas to declare the cause of it, who attributes it to the
6150	refusal of Chryseis. The King being obliged to send back his captive,
6150	enters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;
6150	however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on
6150	Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his
6150	forces from the test of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she
6150	supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her
6150	son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter granting her suit,
6150	incenses Juno, between whom the debate runs high, till they are
6150	reconciled by the address of Vulcan.
6150	""
6150	The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book; nine during
6150	the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the Princes, and twelve
6150	for Jupiter's stay among the Ethiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers
6150	her petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to
6150	Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.

6150	BOOK I.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Of Peleus' son, Achilles, sing, O Muse,
6150	The vengeance, deep and deadly; whence to Greece
6150	Unnumbered ills arose; which many a soul
6150	Of mighty warriors to the viewless shades
6150	Untimely sent; they on the battle plain
6150	Unburied lay, a prey to rav'ning dogs,
6150	And carrion birds; but so had Jove decreed,
6150	From that sad day when first in wordy war,
6150	The mighty Agamemnon, King of men,
6150	Confronted stood by Peleus' godlike son.
6150	""
6150	Say then, what God the fatal strife provok'd?
6150	Jove's and Latona's son; he, filled with wrath
6150	Against the King, with deadly pestilence
6150	The camp afflicted,--and the people died,--
6150	For Chryses' sake, his priest, whom Atreus' son
6150	With scorn dismiss'd, when to the Grecian ships
6150	He came, his captive daughter to redeem,
6150	With costly ransom charg'd; and in his hand
6150	The sacred fillet of his God he bore,
6150	And golden staff; to all he sued, but chief
6150	To Atreus' sons, twin captains of the host:
6150	"""Ye sons of Atreus, and ye well-greav'd Greeks,"
6150	May the great Gods, who on Olympus dwell,
6150	Grant you yon hostile city to destroy,
6150	And home return in safety; but my child
6150	Restore, I pray; her proffer'd ransom take,
6150	"And in his priest, the Lord of Light revere."""
6150	""
6150	Then through the ranks assenting murmurs ran,
6150	The priest to rev'rence, and the ransom take:
6150	Not so Atrides; he, with haughty mien,
6150	And bitter speech, the trembling sire address'd:
6150	"""Old man, I warn thee, that beside our ships"
6150	I find thee not, or ling'ring now, or back
6150	Returning; lest thou prove of small avail
6150	Thy golden staff, and fillet of thy God.
6150	Her I release not, till her youth be fled;
6150	Within my walls, in Argos, far from home,
6150	Her lot is cast, domestic cares to ply,
6150	And share a master's bed. For thee, begone!
6150	"Incense me not, lest ill betide thee now."""
6150	""
6150	He said: the old man trembled, and obeyed;
6150	Beside the many-dashing Ocean's shore
6150	Silent he pass'd; and all apart, he pray'd
6150	To great Apollo, fair Latona's son:
6150	""
6150	"""Hear me, God of the silver bow! whose care"
6150	Chrysa surrounds, and Cilia's lovely vale;
6150	Whose sov'reign sway o'er Tenedos extends;
6150	O Smintheus, hear! if e'er my offered gifts
6150	Found favour in thy sight; if e'er to thee
6150	I burn'd the fat of bulls and choicest goats,
6150	Grant me this boon--upon the Grecian host
6150	"Let thine unerring darts avenge my tears."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he pray'd, his pray'r Apollo heard:
6150	Along Olympus' heights he pass'd, his heart
6150	Burning with wrath; behind his shoulders hung
6150	His bow, and ample quiver; at his back
6150	Rattled the fateful arrows as he mov'd;
6150	Like the night-cloud he pass'd, and from afar
6150	He bent against the ships, and sped the bolt;
6150	And fierce and deadly twang'd the silver bow.
6150	First on the mules and dogs, on man the last,
6150	Was pour'd the arrowy storm; and through the camp,
6150	Constant and num'rous, blaz'd the fun'ral fires.
6150	""
6150	Nine days the heav'nly Archer on the troops
6150	Hurl'd his dread shafts; the tenth, th' assembled Greeks
6150	Achilles call'd to council; so inspir'd
6150	By Juno, white-arm'd Goddess, who beheld
6150	With pitying eyes the wasting hosts of Greece.
6150	When all were met, and closely throng'd around,
6150	Rose the swift-footed chief, and thus began:
6150	""
6150	"""Great son of Atreus, to my mind there seems,"
6150	If we would 'scape from death, one only course,
6150	Home to retrace our steps: since here at once
6150	By war and pestilence our forces waste.
6150	But seek we first some prophet, or some priest,
6150	Or some wise vision-seer (since visions too
6150	From Jove proceed), who may the cause explain,
6150	Which with such deadly wrath Apollo fires:
6150	If for neglected hecatombs or pray'rs
6150	He blame us; or if fat of lambs and goats
6150	"May soothe his anger and the plague assuage."""
6150	""
6150	This said, he sat; and Thestor's son arose,
6150	Calchas, the chief of seers, to whom were known
6150	The present, and the future, and the past;
6150	Who, by his mystic art, Apollo's gift,
6150	Guided to Ilium's shore the Grecian fleet.
6150	Who thus with cautious speech replied, and said;
6150	"""Achilles, lov'd of Heav'n, thou bidd'st me say"
6150	Why thus incens'd the far-destroying King;
6150	Therefore I speak; but promise thou, and swear,
6150	By word and hand, to bear me harmless through.
6150	For well I know my speech must one offend,
6150	The Argive chief, o'er all the Greeks supreme;
6150	And terrible to men of low estate
6150	The anger of a King; for though awhile
6150	He veil his wrath, yet in his bosom pent
6150	It still is nurs'd, until the time arrive;
6150	"Say, then, wilt thou protect me, if I speak?"""
6150	""
6150	Him answer'd thus Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""Speak boldly out whate'er thine art can tell;"
6150	For by Apollo's self I swear, whom thou,
6150	O Calchas, serv'st, and who thy words inspires,
6150	That, while I live, and see the light of Heav'n,
6150	Not one of all the Greeks shall dare on thee,
6150	Beside our ships, injurious hands to lay:
6150	No, not if Agamemnon's self were he,
6150	"Who 'mid our warriors boasts the foremost place."""
6150	""
6150	Embolden'd thus, th' unerring prophet spoke:
6150	"""Not for neglected hecatombs or pray'rs,"
6150	But for his priest, whom Agamemnon scorn'd,
6150	Nor took his ransom, nor his child restor'd;
6150	On his account the Far-destroyer sends
6150	This scourge of pestilence, and yet will send;
6150	Nor shall we cease his heavy hand to feel,
6150	Till to her sire we give the bright-ey'd girl,
6150	Unbought, unransom'd, and to Chrysa's shore
6150	A solemn hecatomb despatch; this done,
6150	"The God, appeas'd, his anger may remit."""
6150	""
6150	This said, he sat; and Atreus' godlike son,
6150	The mighty monarch, Agamemnon, rose,
6150	His dark soul fill'd with fury, and his eyes
6150	Flashing like flames of fire; on Calchas first
6150	A with'ring glance he cast, and thus he spoke;
6150	""
6150	"""Prophet of ill! thou never speak'st to me"
6150	But words of evil omen; for thy soul
6150	Delights to augur ill, but aught of good
6150	Thou never yet hast promis'd, nor perform'd.
6150	And now among the Greeks thou spread'st abroad
6150	Thy lying prophecies, that all these ills
6150	Come from the Far-destroyer, for that I
6150	Refus'd the ransom of my lovely prize,
6150	And that I rather chose herself to keep,
6150	To me not less than Clytemnestra dear,
6150	My virgin-wedded wife; nor less adorn'd
6150	In gifts of form, of feature, or of mind.
6150	Yet, if it must he so, I give her back;
6150	I wish my people's safety, not their death.
6150	But seek me out forthwith some other spoil,
6150	Lest empty-handed I alone appear
6150	Of all the Greeks; for this would ill beseem;
6150	"And how I lose my present share, ye see."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Achilles, swift of foot, replied:
6150	"""Haughtiest of men, and greediest of the prey!"
6150	How shall our valiant Greeks for thee seek out
6150	Some other spoil? no common fund have we
6150	Of hoarded treasures; what our arms have won
6150	From captur'd towns, has been already shar'd,
6150	Nor can we now resume th' apportion'd spoil.
6150	Restore the maid, obedient to the God!
6150	And if Heav'n will that we the strong-built walls
6150	Of Troy should raze, our warriors will to thee
6150	"A threefold, fourfold recompense assign."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
6150	"""Think not, Achilles, valiant though thou art"
6150	In fight, and godlike, to defraud me thus;
6150	Thou shalt not so persuade me, nor o'erreach.
6150	Think'st thou to keep thy portion of the spoil,
6150	While I with empty hands sit humbly down?
6150	The bright-ey'd girl thou bidd'st me to restore;
6150	If then the valiant Greeks for me seek out
6150	Some other spoil, some compensation just,
6150	'Tis well: if not, I with my own right hand
6150	Will from some other chief, from thee perchance,
6150	Or Ajax, or Ulysses, wrest his prey;
6150	And woe to him, on whomsoe'er I call!
6150	But this for future counsel we remit:
6150	Haste we then now our dark-ribb'd bark to launch,
6150	Muster a fitting crew, and place on board
6150	The sacred hecatomb; then last embark
6150	The fair Chryseis; and in chief command
6150	Let some one of our councillors be plac'd,
6150	Ajax, Ulysses, or Idomeneus,
6150	Or thou, the most ambitious of them all,
6150	"That so our rites may soothe the angry God."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Achilles thus with scornful glance;
6150	"""Oh, cloth'd in shamelessness! oh, sordid soul!"
6150	How canst thou hope that any Greek for thee
6150	Will brave the toils of travel or of war?
6150	Well dost thou know that 't was no feud of mine
6150	With Troy's brave sons that brought me here in arms;
6150	They never did me wrong; they never drove
6150	My cattle, or my horses; never sought
6150	In Phthia's fertile, life-sustaining fields
6150	To waste the crops; for wide between us lay
6150	The shadowy mountains and the roaring sea.
6150	With thee, O void of shame! with thee we sail'd,
6150	For Menelaus and for thee, ingrate,
6150	Glory and fame on Trojan crests to win.
6150	All this hast thou forgotten, or despis'd;
6150	And threat'nest now to wrest from me the prize
6150	I labour'd hard to win, and Greeks bestow'd.
6150	Nor does my portion ever equal thine,
6150	When on some populous town our troops have made
6150	Successful war; in the contentious fight
6150	The larger portion of the toil is mine;
6150	But when the day of distribution comes,
6150	Thine is the richest spoil; while I, forsooth,
6150	Must be too well content to bear on board
6150	Some paltry prize for all my warlike toil.
6150	To Phthia now I go; so better far,
6150	To steer my homeward course, and leave thee here
6150	But little like, I deem, dishonouring me,
6150	"To fill thy coffers with the spoils of war."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd Agamemnon, King of men:
6150	"""Fly then, if such thy mind! I ask thee not"
6150	On mine account to stay; others there are
6150	Will guard my honour and avenge my cause:
6150	And chief of all, the Lord of counsel, Jove!
6150	Of all the Heav'n-born Kings, thou art the man
6150	I hate the most; for thou delight'st in nought
6150	But war and strife: thy prowess I allow;
6150	Yet this, remember, is the gift of Heav'n.
6150	Return then, with thy vessels, if thou wilt,
6150	And with thy followers, home; and lord it there
6150	Over thy Myrmidons! I heed thee not!
6150	I care not for thy fury! Hear my threat:
6150	Since Phoebus wrests Chryseis from my arms,
6150	In mine own ship, and with mine own good crew,
6150	Her I send forth; and, in her stead, I mean,
6150	Ev'n from thy tent, myself, to bear thy prize,
6150	The fair Briseis; that henceforth thou know
6150	How far I am thy master; and that, taught
6150	By thine example, others too may fear
6150	"To rival me, and brave me to my face."""
6150	""
6150	Thus while he spake, Achilles chaf'd with rage;
6150	And in his manly breast his heart was torn
6150	With thoughts conflicting--whether from his side
6150	To draw his mighty sword, and thrusting by
6150	Th' assembled throng, to kill th' insulting King;
6150	Or school his soul, and keep his anger down.
6150	But while in mind and spirit thus he mus'd,
6150	And half unsheath'd his sword, from Heav'n came down
6150	Minerva, sent by Juno, white-arm'd Queen,
6150	Whose love and care both chiefs alike enjoy'd.
6150	She stood behind, and by the yellow hair
6150	She held the son of Peleus, visible
6150	To him alone, by all the rest unseen.
6150	Achilles, wond'ring, turn'd, and straight he knew
6150	The blue-eyed Pallas; awful was her glance;
6150	Whom thus the chief with winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Why com'st thou, child of aegis-bearing Jove?"
6150	To see the arrogance of Atreus' son?
6150	But this I say, and will make good my words,
6150	"This insolence may cost him soon his life."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the blue-ey'd Goddess thus replied:
6150	"""From Heav'n I came, to curb, if thou wilt hear,"
6150	Thy fury; sent by Juno, white-arm'd Queen,
6150	Whose love and care ye both alike enjoy.
6150	Cease, then, these broils, and draw not thus thy sword;
6150	In words, indeed, assail him as thou wilt.
6150	But this I promise, and will make it good,
6150	The time shall come, when for this insolence
6150	A threefold compensation shall be thine;
6150	"Only be sway'd by me, and curb thy wrath."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""Goddess, I needs must yield to your commands,"
6150	Indignant though I be--for so 'tis best;
6150	"Who hears the Gods, of them his pray'rs are heard."""
6150	""
6150	He said: and on the silver hilt he stay'd
6150	His pow'rful hand, and flung his mighty sword
6150	Back to its scabbard, to Minerva's word
6150	Obedient: she her heav'nward course pursued
6150	To join th' Immortals in th' abode of Jove.
6150	But Peleus' son, with undiminish'd wrath,
6150	Atrides thus with bitter words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Thou sot, with eye of dog, and heart of deer!"
6150	Who never dar'st to lead in armed fight
6150	Th' assembled host, nor with a chosen few
6150	To man the secret ambush--for thou fear'st
6150	To look on death--no doubt 'tis easier far,
6150	Girt with thy troops, to plunder of his right
6150	Whoe'er may venture to oppose thy will!
6150	A tyrant King, because thou rul'st o'er slaves!
6150	Were it not so, this insult were thy last.
6150	But this I say, and with an oath confirm,
6150	By this my royal staff, which never more
6150	Shall put forth leaf nor spray, since first it left
6150	Upon the mountain-side its parent stem,
6150	Nor blossom more; since all around the axe
6150	Hath lopp'd both leaf and bark, and now 'tis borne
6150	Emblem of justice, by the sons of Greece,
6150	Who guard the sacred ministry of law
6150	Before the face of Jove! a mighty oath!
6150	The time shall come, when all the sons of Greece
6150	Shall mourn Achilles' loss; and thou the while,
6150	Heart-rent, shalt be all-impotent to aid,
6150	When by the warrior-slayer Hector's hand
6150	Many shall fall; and then thy soul shall mourn
6150	"The slight on Grecia's bravest warrior cast."""
6150	""
6150	Thus spoke Pelides; and upon the ground
6150	He cast his staff, with golden studs emboss'd,
6150	And took his seat; on th' other side, in wrath,
6150	Atrides burn'd; but Nestor interpos'd;
6150	Nestor, the leader of the Pylian host,
6150	The smooth-tongued chief, from whose persuasive lips
6150	Sweeter than honey flowed the stream of speech.
6150	Two generations of the sons of men
6150	For him were past and gone, who with himself
6150	Were born and bred on Pylos' lovely shore,
6150	And o'er the third he now held royal sway.
6150	He thus with prudent words the chiefs address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Alas, alas! what grief is this for Greece!"
6150	What joy for Priam, and for Priam's sons!
6150	What exultation for the men of Troy,
6150	To hear of feuds 'tween you, of all the Greeks
6150	The first in council, and the first in fight!
6150	Yet, hear my words, I pray; in years, at least,
6150	Ye both must yield to me; and in times past
6150	I liv'd with men, and they despis'd me not,
6150	Abler in counsel, greater than yourselves.
6150	Such men I never saw, and ne'er shall see,
6150	As Pirithous and Dryas, wise and brave,
6150	Coeneus, Exadius, godlike Polypheme,
6150	And Theseus, AEgeus' more than mortal son.
6150	The mightiest they among the sons of men;
6150	The mightiest they, and of the forest beasts
6150	Strove with the mightiest, and their rage subdued.
6150	With them from distant lands, from Pylos' shore
6150	I join'd my forces, and their call obey'd;
6150	With them I play'd my part; with them, not one
6150	Would dare to fight of mortals now on earth.
6150	Yet they my counsels heard, my voice obey'd;
6150	And hear ye also, for my words are wise.
6150	Nor thou, though great thou be, attempt to rob
6150	Achilles of his prize, but let him keep
6150	The spoil assign'd him by the sons of Greece;
6150	Nor thou, Pelides, with the monarch strive
6150	In rivalry; for ne'er to sceptred King
6150	Hath Jove such pow'rs, as to Atrides, giv'n;
6150	And valiant though thou art, and Goddess-born,
6150	Yet mightier he, for wider is his sway.
6150	Atrides, curb thy wrath! while I beseech
6150	Achilles to forbear; in whom the Greeks
6150	"From adverse war their great defender see."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the monarch, Agamemnon, thus:
6150	"""O father, full of wisdom are thy words;"
6150	But this proud chief o'er all would domineer;
6150	O'er all he seeks to rule, o'er all to reign,
6150	To all to dictate; which I will not bear.
6150	Grant that the Gods have giv'n him warlike might,
6150	"Gave they unbridled license to his tongue?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom Achilles, interrupting, thus:
6150	"""Coward and slave indeed I might be deem'd."
6150	Could I submit to make thy word my law;
6150	To others thy commands; seek not to me
6150	To dictate, for I follow thee no more.
6150	But hear me speak, and ponder what I say:
6150	For the fair girl I fight not (since you choose
6150	To take away the prize yourselves bestow'd)
6150	With thee or any one; but of the rest
6150	My dark swift ship contains, against my will
6150	On nought shalt thou, unpunish'd, lay thy hand.
6150	Make trial if thou wilt, that these may know;
6150	"Thy life-blood soon should reek upon my spear."""
6150	""
6150	After this conflict keen of angry speech,
6150	The chiefs arose, the assembly was dispers'd.
6150	""
6150	With his own followers, and Menoetius' son,
6150	Achilles to his tents and ships withdrew.
6150	But Atreus' son launch'd a swift-sailing bark,
6150	With twenty rowers mann'd, and plac'd on board
6150	The sacred hecatomb; then last embark'd
6150	The fair Chryseis, and in chief command
6150	Laertes' son, the sage Ulysses, plac'd.
6150	They swiftly sped along the wat'ry way.
6150	""
6150	Next, proclamation through the camp was made
6150	To purify the host; and in the sea,
6150	Obedient to the word, they purified;
6150	Then to Apollo solemn rites perform'd
6150	With faultless hecatombs of bulls and goats,
6150	Upon the margin of the wat'ry waste;
6150	And, wreath'd in smoke, the savour rose to Heav'n.
6150	""
6150	The camp thus occupied, the King pursued
6150	His threaten'd plan of vengeance; to his side
6150	Calling Talthybius and Eurybates,
6150	Heralds, and faithful followers, thus he spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Haste to Achilles' tent, and in your hand"
6150	Back with you thence the fair Briseis bring:
6150	If he refuse to send her, I myself
6150	With a sufficient force will bear her thence,
6150	"Which he may find, perchance, the worse for him."""
6150	""
6150	So spake the monarch, and with stern command
6150	Dismiss'd them; with reluctant steps they pass'd
6150	Along the margin of the wat'ry waste,
6150	Till to the tents and ships they came, where lay
6150	The warlike Myrmidons. Their chief they found
6150	Sitting beside his tent and dark-ribb'd ship.
6150	Achilles mark'd their coming, not well pleas'd:
6150	With troubled mien, and awe-struck by the King,
6150	They stood, nor dar'd accost him; but himself
6150	Divin'd their errand, and address'd them thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Welcome, ye messengers of Gods and men,"
6150	Heralds! approach in safety; not with you,
6150	But with Atrides, is my just offence,
6150	Who for the fair Briseis sends you here.
6150	Go, then, Patroclus, bring the maiden forth,
6150	And give her to their hands; but witness ye,
6150	Before the blessed Gods and mortal men,
6150	And to the face of that injurious King,
6150	When he shall need my arm, from shameful rout
6150	To save his followers; blinded by his rage,
6150	He neither heeds experience of the past
6150	Nor scans the future, provident how best
6150	"To guard his fleet and army from the foe."""
6150	""
6150	He spoke: obedient to his friend and chief,
6150	Patroclus led the fair Briseis forth,
6150	And gave her to their hands; they to the ships
6150	Retrac'd their steps, and with them the fair girl
6150	Reluctant went: meanwhile Achilles, plung'd
6150	In bitter grief, from all the band apart,
6150	Upon the margin of the hoary sea
6150	Sat idly gazing on the dark-blue waves;
6150	And to his Goddess-mother long he pray'd,
6150	"With outstretch'd hands, ""Oh, mother! since thy son"
6150	To early death by destiny is doom'd,
6150	I might have hop'd the Thunderer on high,
6150	Olympian Jove, with honour would have crown'd
6150	My little space; but now disgrace is mine;
6150	Since Agamemnon, the wide-ruling King,
6150	"Hath wrested from me, and still holds, my prize."""
6150	""
6150	Weeping, he spoke; his Goddess-mother heard,
6150	Beside her aged father where she sat
6150	In the deep ocean-caves: ascending quick
6150	Through the dark waves, like to a misty cloud,
6150	Beside her son she stood; and as he wept,
6150	She gently touch'd him with her hand, and said,
6150	"""Why weeps my son? and whence his cause of grief?"
6150	"Speak out, that I may hear, and share thy pain."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Achilles, swift of foot, replied,
6150	"Groaning, ""Thou know'st; what boots to tell thee all?"
6150	On Thebes we march'd, Eetion's sacred town,
6150	And storm'd the walls, and hither bore the spoil.
6150	The spoils were fairly by the sons of Greece
6150	Apportion'd out; and to Atrides' share
6150	The beauteous daughter of old Chryses fell.
6150	Chryses, Apollo's priest, to free his child,
6150	Came to th' encampment of the brass-clad Greeks,
6150	With costly ransom charg'd; and in his hand
6150	The sacred fillet of his God he bore,
6150	And golden staff; to all he sued, but chief
6150	To Atreus' sons, twin captains of the host.
6150	Then through the ranks assenting murmurs ran,
6150	The priest to rev'rence, and the ransom take:
6150	Not so Atrides; he, with haughty mien
6150	And bitter words, the trembling sire dismiss'd.
6150	The old man turn'd in sorrow; but his pray'r
6150	Phoebus Apollo heard, who lov'd him well.
6150	Against the Greeks he bent his fatal bow,
6150	And fast the people fell; on ev'ry side
6150	Throughout the camp the heav'nly arrows flew;
6150	A skilful seer at length the cause reveal'd
6150	Why thus incens'd the Archer-God; I then,
6150	The first, gave counsel to appease his wrath.
6150	Whereat Atrides, full of fury, rose,
6150	And utter'd threats, which he hath now fulfill'd.
6150	For Chryses' daughter to her native land
6150	In a swift-sailing ship the keen-ey'd Greeks
6150	Have sent, with costly off'rings to the God:
6150	But her, assign'd me by the sons of Greece,
6150	Brises' fair daughter, from my tent e'en now
6150	The heralds bear away. Then, Goddess, thou,
6150	If thou hast pow'r, protect thine injur'd son.
6150	Fly to Olympus, to the feet of Jove,
6150	And make thy pray'r to him, if on his heart
6150	Thou hast in truth, by word or deed, a claim.
6150	For I remember, in my father's house,
6150	I oft have heard thee boast, how thou, alone
6150	Of all th' Immortals, Saturn's cloud-girt son
6150	Didst shield from foul disgrace, when all the rest,
6150	Juno, and Neptune, and Minerva join'd,
6150	With chains to bind him; then, O Goddess, thou
6150	Didst set him free, invoking to his aid
6150	Him of the hundred arms, whom Briareus
6150	Th' immortal Gods, and men AEgeon call.
6150	He, mightier than his father, took his seat
6150	By Saturn's side, in pride of conscious strength:
6150	Fear seiz'd on all the Gods, nor did they dare
6150	To bind their King: of this remind him now,
6150	And clasp his knees, and supplicate his aid
6150	For Troy's brave warriors, that the routed Greeks
6150	Back to their ships with slaughter may be driv'n;
6150	That all may taste the folly of their King,
6150	And Agamemnon's haughty self may mourn
6150	"The slight on Grecia's bravest warrior cast."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; and Thetis, weeping, thus replied:
6150	"""Alas, my child, that e'er I gave thee birth!"
6150	Would that beside thy ships thou could'st remain
6150	From grief exempt, and insult! since by fate
6150	Few years are thine, and not a lengthened term;
6150	At once to early death and sorrows doom'd
6150	Beyond the lot of man! in evil hour
6150	I gave thee birth! But to the snow-clad heights
6150	Of great Olympus, to the throne of Jove,
6150	Who wields the thunder, thy complaints I bear.
6150	Thou by thy ships, meanwhile, against the Greeks
6150	Thine anger nurse, and from the fight abstain.
6150	For Jove is to a solemn banquet gone
6150	Beyond the sea, on AEthiopia's shore,
6150	Since yesternight; and with him all the Gods.
6150	On the twelfth day he purpos'd to return
6150	To high Olympus; thither then will I,
6150	And to his feet my supplication make;
6150	"And he, I think, will not deny my suit."""
6150	""
6150	This said, she disappear'd; and left him there
6150	Musing in anger on the lovely form
6150	Tom from his arms by violence away.
6150	""
6150	Meantime, Ulysses, with his sacred freight,
6150	Arriv'd at Chrysa's strand; and when his bark
6150	Had reach'd the shelter of the deep sea bay,
6150	Their sails they furl'd, and lower'd to the hold;
6150	Slack'd the retaining shrouds, and quickly struck
6150	And stow'd away the mast; then with their sweeps
6150	Pull'd for the beach, and cast their anchors out,
6150	And made her fast with cables to the shore.
6150	Then on the shingly breakwater themselves
6150	They landed, and the sacred hecatomb
6150	To great Apollo; and Chryseis last.
6150	Her to the altar straight Ulysses led,
6150	The wise in counsel; in her father's hand
6150	He plac'd the maiden, and address'd him thus:
6150	"""Chryses, from Agamemnon, King of men,"
6150	To thee I come, thy daughter to restore;
6150	And to thy God, upon the Greeks' behalf,
6150	To offer sacrifice, if haply so
6150	We may appease his wrath, who now incens'd
6150	"With grievous suff'ring visits all our host."""
6150	Then to her sire he gave her; he with joy
6150	Receiv'd his child; the sacred hecatomb
6150	Around the well-built altar for the God
6150	In order due they plac'd; their hands then washed,
6150	And the salt cake prepar'd, before them all
6150	With hands uplifted Chryses pray'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Hear me, God of the silver bow! whose care"
6150	Chrysa surrounds, and Cilla's lovely vale,
6150	Whose sov'reign sway o'er Tenedos extends!
6150	Once hast thou heard my pray'r, aveng'd my cause,
6150	And pour'd thy fury on the Grecian host.
6150	Hear yet again, and grant what now I ask;
6150	"Withdraw thy chast'ning hand, and stay the plague."""
6150	""
6150	Thus, as he pray'd, his pray'r Apollo heard.
6150	Their pray'rs concluded, and the salt cake strew'd
6150	Upon the victims' heads, they drew them back,
6150	And slew, and flay'd; then cutting from the thighs
6150	The choicest pieces, and in double layers
6150	O'erspreading them with fat, above them plac'd
6150	The due meat-off'rings; then the aged priest
6150	The cleft wood kindled, and libations pour'd
6150	Of ruddy wine; arm'd with the five-fork'd prongs
6150	Th' attendant ministers beside him stood.
6150	The thighs consum'd with fire, the inward parts
6150	They tasted first; the rest upon the spits
6150	Roasted with care, and from the fire withdrew.
6150	Their labours ended, and the feast prepar'd,
6150	They shared the social meal, nor lacked there aught.
6150	The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,
6150	Th' attendant youths the flowing goblets crown'd,
6150	And in fit order serv'd the cups to all.
6150	All day they sought the favour of the God,
6150	The glorious paeans chanting, and the praise
6150	Of Phoebus: he, well pleas'd, the strain receiv'd
6150	But when the sun was set, and shades of night
6150	O'erspread the sky, upon the sandy beach
6150	Close to their ship they laid them down to rest.
6150	And when the rosy-finger'd morn appear'd,
6150	Back to the camp they took their homeward way
6150	A fav'ring breeze the Far-destroyer sent:
6150	They stepp'd the mast, and spread the snowy sail:
6150	Full in the midst the bellying sail receiv'd
6150	The gallant breeze; and round the vessel's prow
6150	The dark waves loudly roar'd, as on she rush'd
6150	Skimming the seas, and cut her wat'ry way.
6150	Arriv'd where lay the wide-spread host of Greece,
6150	Their dark-ribb'd vessel on the beach they drew
6150	High on the sand, and strongly shor'd her up;
6150	Then through the camp they took their sev'ral ways.
6150	""
6150	Meantime, beside the ships Achilles sat,
6150	The Heav'n-born son of Peleus, swift of foot,
6150	Chafing with rage repress'd; no more he sought
6150	The honour'd council, nor the battle-field;
6150	But wore his soul away, and inly pin'd
6150	For the fierce joy and tumult of the fight.
6150	But when the twelfth revolving day was come,
6150	Back to Olympus' heights th' immortal Gods,
6150	Jove at their head, together all return'd.
6150	Then Thetis, mindful of her son's request,
6150	Rose from the ocean wave, and sped in haste
6150	To high Olympus, and the courts of Heav'n.
6150	Th' all-seeing son of Saturn there she found
6150	Sitting apart upon the topmost crest
6150	Of many-ridg'd Olympus; at his feet
6150	She sat, and while her left hand clasp'd his knees,
6150	Her right approached his beard, and suppliant thus
6150	She made her pray'r to Saturn's royal son:
6150	""
6150	"""Father, if e'er amid th' immortal Gods"
6150	By word or deed I did thee service true,
6150	Hear now my pray'r! Avenge my hapless son,
6150	Of mortals shortest-liv'd, insulted now
6150	By mighty Agamemnon, King of men,
6150	And plunder'd of his lawful spoils of war.
6150	But Jove, Olympian, Lord of counsel, Thou
6150	Avenge his cause; and give to Trojan arms
6150	Such strength and pow'r, that Greeks may learn how much
6150	"They need my son, and give him honour due."""
6150	""
6150	She said: the Cloud-compeller answer'd not,
6150	But silent sat; then Thetis clasp'd his knees,
6150	And hung about him, and her suit renew'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Give me thy promise sure, thy gracious nod,"
6150	Or else refuse (for thou hast none to fear),
6150	That I may learn, of all th' immortal Gods,
6150	"How far I stand the lowest in thine eyes."""
6150	""
6150	Then, much disturb'd, the Cloud-compeller spoke:
6150	"""Sad work thou mak'st, in bidding me oppose"
6150	My will to Juno's, when her bitter words
6150	Assail me; for full oft amid the Gods
6150	She taunts me, that I aid the Trojan cause.
6150	But thou return, that Juno see thee not,
6150	And leave to me the furth'rance of thy suit.
6150	Lo, to confirm thy faith, I nod my head;
6150	And well among th' immortal Gods is known
6150	The solemn import of that pledge from me:
6150	For ne'er my promise shall deceive, or fail,
6150	"Or be recall'd, if with a nod confirm'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and nodded with his shadowy brows;
6150	Wav'd on th' immortal head th' ambrosial locks,
6150	And all Olympus trembled at his nod.
6150	They parted thus: from bright Olympus' heights
6150	The Goddess hasted to her ocean-caves,
6150	Jove to his palace; at his entrance all
6150	Rose from their seats at once; not one presum'd
6150	To wait his coming, but advanc'd to meet.
6150	Then on his throne he sat; but not unmark'd
6150	Of Juno's eye had been the council held
6150	In secret with the silver-footed Queen,
6150	The daughter of the aged Ocean-God;
6150	And with sharp words she thus addressed her Lord:
6150	""
6150	"""Tell me, deceiver, who was she with whom"
6150	Thou late held'st council? ever 'tis thy way
6150	Apart from me to weave thy secret schemes,
6150	"Nor dost thou freely share with me thy mind."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Sire of Gods and men replied:
6150	"""Expect not, Juno, all my mind to know;"
6150	My wife thou art, yet would such knowledge be
6150	Too much for thee; whate'er I deem it fit
6150	That thou shouldst know, nor God nor man shall hear
6150	Before thee; but what I in secret plan,
6150	"Seek not to know, nor curiously inquire."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the stag-ey'd Queen of Heav'n:
6150	"""What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
6150	Ne'er have I sought, or now, or heretofore,
6150	Thy secret thoughts to know; what thou think'st fit
6150	To tell, I wait thy gracious will to hear.
6150	Yet fear I in my soul thou art beguil'd
6150	By wiles of Thetis, silver-footed Queen,
6150	The daughter of the aged Ocean-God;
6150	For she was with thee early, and embrac'd
6150	Thy knees, and has, I think, thy promise sure,
6150	Thou wilt avenge Achilles' cause, and bring
6150	"Destructive slaughter on the Grecian host."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
6150	"""Presumptuous, to thy busy thoughts thou giv'st"
6150	Too free a range, and watchest all I do;
6150	Yet shalt thou not prevail, but rather thus
6150	Be alien'd from my heart--the worse for thee!
6150	If this be so, it is my sov'reign will.
6150	But now, keep silence, and my words obey,
6150	Lest all th' Immortals fail, if I be wroth,
6150	"To rescue thee from my resistless hand."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and terror seiz'd the stag-ey'd Queen:
6150	Silent she sat, curbing her spirit down,
6150	And all the Gods in pitying sorrow mourn'd.
6150	Vulcan, the skill'd artificer, then first
6150	Broke silence, and with soothing words address'd
6150	His mother, Juno, white-arm'd Queen of Heav'n:
6150	"""Sad were't, indeed, and grievous to be borne,"
6150	If for the sake of mortal men you two
6150	Should suffer angry passions to arise,
6150	And kindle broils in Heav'n; so should our feast
6150	By evil influence all its sweetness lack.
6150	Let me advise my mother (and I know
6150	That her own reason will my words approve)
6150	To speak my father fair; lest he again
6150	Reply in anger, and our banquet mar.
6150	For Jove, the lightning's Lord, if such his will,
6150	Might hurl us from our seats (so great his pow'r),
6150	But thou address him still with gentle words;
6150	"So shall his favour soon again be ours."""
6150	""
6150	This said, he rose, and in his mother's hand
6150	A double goblet plac'd, as thus he spoke:
6150	"""Have patience, mother mine! though much enforc'd,"
6150	Restrain thy spirit, lest perchance these eyes,
6150	Dear as thou art, behold thee brought to shame;
6150	And I, though griev'd in heart, be impotent
6150	To save thee; for 'tis hard to strive with Jove.
6150	When to thy succour once before I came,
6150	He seiz'd me by the foot, and hurl'd me down
6150	From Heav'n's high threshold; all the day I fell,
6150	And with the setting sun, on Lemnos' isle
6150	Lighted, scarce half alive; there was I found,
6150	"And by the Sintian people kindly nurs'd."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, the white-armed Goddess smil'd,
6150	And, smiling, from, his hand receiv'd the cup,
6150	Then to th' Immortals all, in order due,
6150	He minister'd, and from the flagon pour'd
6150	The luscious nectar; while among the Gods
6150	Rose laughter irrepressible, at sight
6150	Of Vulcan hobbling round the spacious hall.
6150	""
6150	Thus they till sunset pass'd the festive hours;
6150	Nor lack'd the banquet aught to please the sense,
6150	Nor sound of tuneful lyre, by Phoebus touch'd,
6150	Nor Muses' voice, who in alternate strains
6150	Responsive sang: but when the sun had set,
6150	Each to his home departed, where for each
6150	The crippled Vulcan, matchless architect,
6150	With wondrous skill a noble house had rear'd.
6150	""
6150	To his own couch, where he was wont of old,
6150	When overcome by gentle sleep, to rest,
6150	Olympian Jove ascended; there he slept,
6150	And, by his side, the golden-throned Queen.

6150	THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful
6150	vision to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle in order
6150	to make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The general, who
6150	is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance, but
6150	fears the army was discouraged by his absence and the late plague, as
6150	well as by length of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition
6150	by a stratagem. He first communicates his design to the princes in
6150	council that he would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they
6150	should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced. Then he
6150	assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they
6150	unanimously agree to it, and run to prepare the ships. They are
6150	detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises the insolence of
6150	Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several speeches made on the
6150	occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed, which was to
6150	make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them into their
6150	several nations, before they proceeded to battle. This gives occasion
6150	to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and Trojans, in a
6150	large catalogue.
6150	""
6150	The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The
6150	scene lies in the Grecian camp and upon the sea-shore; toward the end
6150	it removes to Troy.

6150	BOOK II.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	All night in sleep repos'd the other Gods,
6150	And helmed warriors; but the eyes of Jove
6150	Sweet slumber held not, pondering in his mind
6150	How to avenge Achilles' cause, and pour
6150	Destructive slaughter on the Grecian host.
6150	Thus as he mus'd, the wisest course appear'd
6150	By a deluding vision to mislead
6150	The son of Atreus; and with winged words
6150	Thus to a phantom form he gave command:
6150	"""Hie thee, deluding Vision, to the camp"
6150	And ships of Greece, to Agamemnon's tent;
6150	There, changing nought, as I command thee, speak.
6150	Bid that he arm in haste the long-hair'd Greeks
6150	To combat; for the wide-built streets of Troy
6150	He now may capture; since th' immortal Gods
6150	Watch over her no longer; all are gain'd
6150	"By Juno's pray'rs; and woes impend o'er Troy."""
6150	""
6150	He said: the Vision heard, and straight obey'd:
6150	Swiftly he sped, and reached the Grecian ships,
6150	And sought the son of Atreus; him he found
6150	Within his tent, wrapped in ambrosial sleep;
6150	Above his head he stood, like Neleus' son,
6150	Nestor, whom Agamemnon rev'renc'd most
6150	Of all the Elders; in his likeness cloth'd
6150	"Thus spoke the heav'nly Vision; ""Sleep'st thou, son"
6150	Of Atreus, valiant warrior, horseman bold?
6150	To sleep all night but ill becomes a chief,
6150	Charg'd with the public weal, and cares of state.
6150	Hear now the words I bear; to thee I come
6150	A messenger from Jove, who from on high
6150	Looks down on thee with eyes of pitying love.
6150	He bids thee arm in haste the long-hair'd Greeks
6150	To combat; since the wide-built streets of Troy
6150	Thou now mayst capture; for th' immortal Gods
6150	Watch over her no longer; all are gain'd
6150	By Juno's pray'rs; and woes impend o'er Troy.
6150	Bear this in mind; and when from sleep arous'd
6150	"Let not my words from thy remembrance fade."""
6150	This said, he vanish'd; and the monarch left,
6150	Inspir'd with thoughts which ne'er should come to pass.
6150	For in that day he vainly hop'd to take
6150	The town of Priam; ignorant what Jove
6150	Design'd in secret, or what woes, what groans,
6150	What lengthen'd labours in the stubborn fight,
6150	Were yet for Trojans and for Greeks in store.
6150	He woke from sleep; but o'er his senses spread
6150	Dwelt still the heavenly voice; he sat upright;
6150	He donn'd his vest of texture fine, new-wrought,
6150	Then o'er it threw his ample robe, and bound
6150	His sandals fair around his well-turn'd feet;
6150	And o'er his shoulders flung his sword, adorn'd
6150	With silver studs; and bearing in his hand
6150	His royal staff, ancestral, to the ships
6150	Where lay the brass-clad warriors, bent his way.
6150	""
6150	Aurora now was rising up the steep
6150	Of great Olympus, to th' immortal Gods
6150	Pure light diffusing; when Atrides bade
6150	The clear-voic'd heralds to th' Assembly call
6150	The gen'ral host; they gave the word, and straight
6150	From ev'ry quarter throng'd the eager crowd.
6150	But first, of all the Elders, by the side
6150	Of Nestor's ship, the aged Pylian chief,
6150	A secret conclave Agamemnon call'd;
6150	And, prudent, thus the chosen few address'd:
6150	"""Hear me, my friends! In the still hours of night"
6150	I saw a heav'nly Vision in my sleep:
6150	Most like it seemed in stature, form, and face
6150	To rev'rend Nestor; at my head it stood,
6150	And with these words address'd me--'Sleep'st thou, son
6150	Of Atreus, valiant warrior, horseman bold?
6150	To sleep all night but ill becomes a chief,
6150	Charg'd with the public weal, and cares of state.
6150	Hear now the words I bear: to thee I come
6150	A messenger from Jove, who from on high
6150	Looks down on thee with eyes of pitying love.
6150	He bids thee arm in haste the long-hair'd Greeks
6150	To combat: since the wide-built streets of Troy
6150	Thou now may'st capture; for th' immortal Gods
6150	Watch over her no longer: all are gain'd
6150	By Juno's pray'rs, and woes impend o'er Troy.
6150	Bear thou my words in mind.' Thus as he spoke
6150	He vanish'd; and sweet sleep forsook mine eyes.
6150	Seek we then straight to arm the sons of Greece:
6150	But first, as is our wont, myself will prove
6150	The spirit of the army; and suggest
6150	Their homeward voyage; ye, throughout the camp
6150	"Restore their courage, and restrain from flight."""
6150	""
6150	Thus having said, he sat; and next arose
6150	Nestor, the chief of Pylos' sandy shore.
6150	Who thus with prudent speech replied, and said:
6150	"""O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
6150	If any other had this Vision seen,
6150	We should have deem'd it false, and laugh'd to scorn
6150	The idle tale; but now it hath appear'd,
6150	Of all our army, to the foremost man:
6150	"Seek we then straight to arm the sons of Greece."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and from the council led the way.
6150	Uprose the sceptred monarchs, and obey'd
6150	Their leader's call, and round them throng'd the crowd.
6150	As swarms of bees, that pour in ceaseless stream
6150	From out the crevice of some hollow rock,
6150	Now clust'ring, and anon 'mid vernal flow'rs,
6150	Some here, some there, in busy numbers fly;
6150	So to th' Assembly from their tents and ships
6150	The countless tribes came thronging; in their midst,
6150	By Jove enkindled, Rumour urged them on.
6150	Great was the din; and as the mighty mass
6150	Sat down, the solid earth beneath them groan'd;
6150	Nine heralds rais'd their voices loud, to quell
6150	The storm of tongues, and bade the noisy crowd
6150	Be still, and listen to the Heav'n-born Kings.
6150	""
6150	At length they all were seated, and awhile
6150	Their clamours sank to silence; then uprose
6150	The monarch Agamemnon, in his hand
6150	His royal staff, the work of Vulcan's art;
6150	Which Vulcan to the son of Saturn gave;
6150	To Hermes he, the heav'nly messenger;
6150	Hermes to Pelops, matchless charioteer;
6150	Pelops to Atreus; Atreus at his death
6150	Bequeath'd it to Thyestes, wealthy Lord
6150	Of num'rous herds; to Agamemnon last
6150	Thyestes left it; token of his sway
6150	O'er all the Argive coast, and neighbouring isles.
6150	On this the monarch leant, as thus he spoke:
6150	"""Friends, Grecian Heroes, Ministers of Mars!"
6150	Grievous, and all unlook'd for, is the blow
6150	Which Jove hath dealt me; by his promise led
6150	I hop'd to raze the strong-built walls of Troy,
6150	And home return in safety; but it seems
6150	He falsifies his word, and bids me now
6150	Return to Argos, frustrate of my hope,
6150	Dishonour'd, and with grievous loss of men.
6150	Such now appears th' o'er-ruling sov'reign will
6150	Of Saturn's son; who oft hath sunk the heads
6150	Of many a lofty city in the dust,
6150	And yet will sink; for mighty is his hand.
6150	'Tis shame indeed that future days should hear
6150	How such a force as ours, so great, so brave,
6150	Hath thus been baffled, fighting, as we do,
6150	'Gainst numbers far inferior to our own,
6150	And see no end of all our warlike toil.
6150	For should we choose, on terms of plighted truce,
6150	Trojans and Greeks, to number our array;
6150	Of Trojans, all that dwell within the town,
6150	And we, by tens disposed, to every ten,
6150	To crown our cups, one Trojan should assign,
6150	Full many a ten no cupbearer would find:
6150	So far the sons of Greece outnumber all
6150	That dwell within the town; but to their aid
6150	Bold warriors come from all the cities round,
6150	Who greatly harass me, and render vain
6150	My hope to storm the strong-built walls of Troy.
6150	Already now nine weary years have pass'd;
6150	The timbers of our ships are all decay'd,
6150	The cordage rotted; in our homes the while
6150	Our wives and helpless children sit, in vain
6150	Expecting our return; and still the work,
6150	For which we hither came, remains undone.
6150	Hear then my counsel; let us all agree
6150	Home to direct our course, since here in vain
6150	"We strive to take the well-built walls of Troy."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, the crowd, that had not heard
6150	The secret council, by his words was mov'd;
6150	So sway'd and heav'd the multitude, as when
6150	O'er the vast billows of th' Icarian sea
6150	Eurus and Notus from the clouds of Heav'n
6150	Pour forth their fury; or as some deep field
6150	Of wavy corn, when sweeping o'er the plain
6150	The ruffling west wind sways the bending ears;
6150	So was th' Assembly stirr'd; and tow'rd the ships
6150	With clam'rous joy they rush'd; beneath, their feet
6150	Rose clouds of dust, while one to other call'd
6150	To seize the ships and drag them to the main.
6150	"They clear'd the channels, and with shouts of ""home"""
6150	That rose to Heav'n, they knock'd the shores away.
6150	Then had the Greeks in shameful flight withdrawn,
6150	Had Juno not to Pallas thus appeal'd:
6150	"""Oh Heav'n! brave child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
6150	Shall thus the Greeks, in ignominious flight,
6150	O'er the wide sea their homeward course pursue,
6150	And as a trophy to the sons of Troy
6150	The Argive Helen leave, on whose account,
6150	Far from their home, so many valiant Greeks
6150	Have cast their lives away? Go quickly thou
6150	Amid the brass-clad Greeks, and man by man
6150	Address with words persuasive, nor permit
6150	"To launch their well-trimm'd vessels on the deep."""
6150	""
6150	She said, nor did Minerva not obey,
6150	But swift descending from Olympus' heights
6150	With rapid flight she reach'd the Grecian ships.
6150	Laertes' son, in council sage as Jove
6150	There found she standing; he no hand had laid
6150	On his dark vessel, for with bitter grief
6150	His heart was filled; the blue-ey'd Maid approach'd,
6150	"And thus address'd him: ""Great Laertes' son,"
6150	Ulysses, sage in council, can it be
6150	That you, the men of Greece, embarking thus
6150	On your swift ships, in ignominious flight,
6150	O'er the wide sea will take your homeward way,
6150	And as a trophy to the sons of Troy
6150	The Argive Helen leave, on whose account
6150	Far from their homes so many valiant Greeks
6150	Have cast their lives away? Go quickly thou
6150	Among the multitude, and man by man
6150	Address with words persuasive, nor permit
6150	"To launch their well-trimm'd vessels on the deep."""
6150	""
6150	She said; the heav'nly voice Ulysses knew;
6150	Straight, springing to the course, he cast aside,
6150	And to Eurybates of Ithaca,
6150	His herald and attendant, threw his robe;
6150	Then to Atrides hasten'd, and by him
6150	Arm'd with his royal staff ancestral, pass'd
6150	With rapid step amid the ships of Greece.
6150	Each King or leader whom he found he thus
6150	With cheering words encourag'd and restrain'd:
6150	"""O gallant friend, 'tis not for thee to yield,"
6150	Like meaner men, to panic; but thyself
6150	Sit quiet, and the common herd restrain.
6150	Thou know'st not yet Atrides' secret mind:
6150	He tries us now, and may reprove us soon.
6150	His words in council reach'd not all our ears:
6150	See that he work us not some ill; for fierce
6150	His anger; and the Lord of counsel, Jove,
6150	"From whom proceeds all honour, loves him well."""
6150	""
6150	But of the common herd whome'er he found
6150	Clam'ring, he check'd with staff and threat'ning words:
6150	"""Good friend, keep still, and hear what others say,"
6150	Thy betters far: for thou art good for nought,
6150	Of small account in council or in fight.
6150	All are not sovereigns here: ill fares the state
6150	Where many masters rule; let one be Lord,
6150	One King supreme; to whom wise Saturn's son
6150	In token of his sov'reign power hath giv'n
6150	"The sceptre's sway and ministry of law."""
6150	""
6150	Such were his words, as through the ranks he pass'd:
6150	They from the vessels and the tents again
6150	Throng'd to th' Assembly, with such rush of sound,
6150	As when the many-dashing ocean's wave
6150	Breaks on the shore, and foams the frothing sea.
6150	The others all were settled in their seats:
6150	Only Thersites, with unmeasur'd words,
6150	Of which he had good store, to rate the chiefs,
6150	Not over-seemly, but wherewith he thought
6150	To move the crowd to laughter, brawl'd aloud.
6150	The ugliest man was he who came to Troy:
6150	With squinting eyes, and one distorted foot,
6150	His shoulders round, and buried in his breast
6150	His narrow head, with scanty growth of hair.
6150	Against Achilles and Ulysses most
6150	His hate was turn'd; on them his venom pour'd;
6150	Anon, at Agamemnon's self he launch'd
6150	His loud-tongued ribaldry; 'gainst him he knew
6150	Incensed the public mind; and bawling loud,                     [1]
6150	With scurril words, he thus address'd the King:
6150	"""What more, thou son of Atreus, would'st thou have?"
6150	Thy tents are full of brass; and in those tents
6150	Many fair women, whom, from all the spoil,
6150	We Greeks, whene'er some wealthy town we take,
6150	Choose first of all, and set apart for thee.
6150	Or dost thou thirst for gold, which here perchance
6150	Some Trojan brings, the ransom of his son
6150	Captur'd by me, or by some other Greek?
6150	Or some new girl, to gratify thy lust,
6150	Kept for thyself apart? a leader, thou
6150	Shouldst not to evil lead the sons of Greece.
6150	Ye slaves! ye coward souls! Women of Greece!
6150	I will not call you men! why go we not
6150	Home with our ships, and leave this mighty chief
6150	To gloat upon his treasures, and find out
6150	Whether in truth he need our aid, or no;
6150	Who on Achilles, his superior far,
6150	Foul scorn hath cast, and robb'd him of his prize,
6150	Which for himself he keeps? Achilles, sure,
6150	Is not intemperate, but mild of mood;
6150	"Else, Atreus' son, this insult were thy last."""
6150	""
6150	On Agamemnon, leader of the host,
6150	With words like these Thersites pour'd his hate;
6150	But straight Ulysses at his side appear'd,
6150	And spoke, with scornful glance, in stern rebuke:
6150	"""Thou babbling fool, Thersites, prompt of speech,"
6150	Restrain thy tongue, nor singly thus presume
6150	The Kings to slander; thou, the meanest far
6150	Of all that with the Atridae came to Troy.
6150	Ill it beseems, that such an one as thou
6150	Should lift thy voice against the Kings, and rail
6150	With scurril ribaldry, and prate of home.
6150	How these affairs may end, we know not yet;
6150	Nor how, or well or ill, we may return.
6150	Cease then against Atrides, King of men,
6150	To pour thy spite, for that the valiant Greeks
6150	To him, despite thy railing, as of right
6150	An ample portion of the spoils assign.
6150	But this I tell thee, and will make it good,
6150	If e'er I find thee play the fool, as now,
6150	Then may these shoulders cease this head to bear,
6150	And may my son Telemachus no more
6150	Own me his father, if I strip not off
6150	Thy mantle and thy garments, aye, expose
6150	Thy nakedness, and flog thee to the ships
6150	"Howling, and scourg'd with ignominious stripes."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, upon Thersites' neck
6150	And back came down his heavy staff; the wretch
6150	Shrank from the blow, and scalding tears let fall.
6150	Where struck the golden-studded staff, appear'd
6150	A bloody weal: Thersites quail'd, and down,
6150	Quiv'ring with pain, he sat, and wip'd away.
6150	With horrible grimace, the trickling tears.
6150	The Greeks, despite their anger, laugh'd aloud,
6150	"And one to other said, ""Good faith, of all"
6150	The many works Ulysses well hath done,
6150	Wise in the council, foremost in the fight,
6150	He ne'er hath done a better, than when now
6150	He makes this scurril babbler hold his peace.
6150	Methinks his headstrong spirit will not soon
6150	"Lead him again to vilify the Kings."""
6150	""
6150	Thus spoke the gen'ral voice: but, staff in hand,
6150	Ulysses rose; Minerva by his side,
6150	In likeness of a herald, bade the crowd
6150	Keep silence, that the Greeks, from first to last,
6150	Might hear his words, and ponder his advice.
6150	He thus with prudent phrase his speech began:
6150	"""Great son of Atreus, on thy name, O King,"
6150	Throughout the world will foul reproach be cast,
6150	If Greeks forget their promise, nor make good
6150	The vow they took to thee, when hitherward
6150	We sailed from Argos' grassy plains, to raze,
6150	Ere our return, the well-built walls of Troy.
6150	But now, like helpless widows, or like babes,
6150	They mourn their cruel fate, and pine for home.
6150	'Tis hard indeed defeated to return;
6150	The seaman murmurs, if from wife and home,
6150	Ev'n for one month, his well-found bark be stay'd,
6150	Toss'd by the wint'ry blasts and stormy sea;
6150	But us the ninth revolving year beholds
6150	Still ling'ring here: I cannot therefore blame
6150	Our valiant Greeks, if by the ships I hear
6150	Their murmurs; yet 'twere surely worst of all
6150	Long to remain, and bootless to return.
6150	Bear up, my friends, remain awhile, and see
6150	If Calchas truly prophesy, or no.
6150	For this ye all have seen, and can yourselves
6150	Bear witness, all who yet are spar'd by fate,
6150	Not long ago, when ships of Greece were met
6150	At Aulis, charg'd with evil freight for Troy,
6150	And we, around a fountain, to the Gods
6150	Our altars rear'd, with faultless hecatombs,
6150	Near a fair plane-tree, where bright water flow'd,
6150	Behold a wonder! by Olympian Jove
6150	Sent forth to light, a snake, with burnish'd scales,
6150	Of aspect fearful, issuing from beneath
6150	The altars, glided to the plane-tree straight.
6150	There, on the topmost bough, beneath the leaves
6150	Cow'ring, a sparrow's callow nestlings lay;
6150	Eight fledglings, and the parent bird the ninth.
6150	All the eight nestlings, utt'ring piercing cries,
6150	The snake devour'd; and as the mother flew,
6150	Lamenting o'er her offspring, round and round,
6150	Uncoiling, caught her, shrieking, by the wing.
6150	Then, when the sparrow's nestlings and herself
6150	The snake had swallowed, by the God, who first
6150	Sent him to light, a miracle was wrought:
6150	For Jove, the deep-designing Saturn's son,
6150	Turn'd him to stone; we stood, and wond'ring gaz'd.
6150	But when this prodigy befell our rites,
6150	Calchas, inspir'd of Heaven, took up his speech:
6150	'Ye long-haired sons of Greece, why stand ye thus
6150	In mute amaze? to us Olympian Jove,
6150	To whom be endless praise, vouchsafes this sign,
6150	Late sent, of late fulfilment: as ye saw
6150	The snake devour the sparrow and her young,
6150	Eight nestlings, and the parent bird the ninth:
6150	So, for so many years, are we condemn'd
6150	To wage a fruitless war; but in the tenth
6150	The wide-built city shall at last be ours.'
6150	Thus he foretold, and now the time is come.
6150	Here then, ye well-greav'd Greeks, let all remain,
6150	"Till Priam's wealthy city be our own."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and loudly cheer'd the Greeks--and loud
6150	From all the hollow ships came back the cheers--
6150	In admiration of Ulysses' speech.
6150	Gerenian Nestor next took up the word:
6150	"""Like children, Grecian warriors, ye debate;"
6150	Like babes to whom unknown are feats of arms.
6150	Where then are now our solemn covenants,
6150	Our plighted oaths? Go, cast we to the fire
6150	Our councils held, our warriors' plans matur'd,
6150	Our absolute pledges, and our hand-plight giv'n,
6150	In which our trust was placed; since thus in vain
6150	In words we wrangle, and how long soe'er
6150	We here remain, solution none we find.
6150	Atrides, thou, as is thy wont, maintain
6150	Unchang'd thy counsel; for the stubborn fight
6150	Array the Greeks; and let perdition seize
6150	Those few, those two or three among the host,
6150	Who hold their separate counsel--(not on them
6150	Depends the issue!)--rather than return
6150	To Argos, ere we prove if Jove indeed
6150	Will falsify his promis'd word, or no.
6150	For well I ween, that on the day when first
6150	We Grecians hitherward our course address'd,
6150	To Troy the messengers of blood and death,
6150	Th' o'er-ruling son of Saturn, on our right
6150	His lightning flashing, with auspicious sign
6150	Assur'd us of his favour; let not then
6150	The thoughts of home be breath'd, ere Trojan wives
6150	Given to our warriors, retribution pay
6150	For wrongs by us, in Helen's cause, sustain'd.
6150	But whoso longs, if such an one there be,
6150	To make his homeward voyage, let him take
6150	His well-rigg'd bark, and go; before the rest
6150	To meet the doom of death! But thou, O King!
6150	Be well advis'd thyself, and others lead
6150	By wholesome counsel; for the words I speak
6150	Are not to be despis'd; by tribes and clans,
6150	O Agamemnon! range thy troops, that so
6150	Tribe may to tribe give aid, and clan to clan.
6150	If thus thou do, and Greeks thy words obey,
6150	Then shalt thou see, of chiefs and troops alike,
6150	The good and bad; for on their own behoof
6150	They all shall fight; and if thou fail, shalt know
6150	Whether thy failure be of Heav'n's decree,
6150	"Or man's default and ignorance of war."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
6150	"""Father, in council, of the sons of Greece,"
6150	None can compare with thee; and would to Jove
6150	To Pallas, and Apollo, at my side
6150	I had but ten such counsellors as thee!
6150	Then soon should royal Priam's city fall,
6150	Tak'n and destroy'd by our victorious hands.
6150	But now on me hath aegis-bearing Jove,
6150	The son of Saturn, fruitless toil impos'd,
6150	And hurtful quarrels; for in wordy war
6150	About a girl, Achilles and myself
6150	Engag'd; and I, alas! the strife began:
6150	Could we be friends again, delay were none,
6150	How short soe'er, of Ilium's final doom.
6150	But now to breakfast, ere we wage the fight.
6150	Each sharpen well his spear, his shield prepare,
6150	Each to his fiery steeds their forage give,
6150	Each look his chariot o'er, that through the day
6150	We may unwearied stem the tide of war;
6150	For respite none, how short soe'er, shall be
6150	Till night shall bid the storm of battle cease.
6150	With sweat shall reek upon each warrior's breast
6150	The leathern belt beneath the cov'ring shield;
6150	And hands shall ache that wield the pond'rous spear:
6150	With sweat shall reek the fiery steeds that draw
6150	Each warrior's car; but whomsoe'er I find
6150	Loit'ring beside the beaked ships, for him
6150	"'Twere hard to'scape the vultures and the dogs."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and from th' applauding ranks of Greece
6150	Rose a loud sound, as when the ocean wave,
6150	Driv'n by the south wind on some lofty beach,
6150	Dashes against a prominent crag, expos'd
6150	To blasts from every storm that roars around.
6150	Uprising then, and through the camp dispers'd
6150	They took their sev'ral ways, and by their tents
6150	The fires they lighted, and the meal prepar'd;
6150	And each to some one of the Immortal Gods
6150	His off'ring made, that in the coming fight
6150	He might escape the bitter doom of death.
6150	But to the o'erruling son of Saturn, Jove,
6150	A sturdy ox, well-fatten'd, five years old,
6150	Atrides slew; and to the banquet call'd
6150	The aged chiefs and councillors of Greece;
6150	Nestor the first, the King Idomeneus,
6150	The two Ajaces next, and Tydeus' son,
6150	Ulysses sixth, as Jove in council sage.
6150	But uninvited Menelaus came,
6150	Knowing what cares upon his brother press'd.
6150	Around the ox they stood, and on his head
6150	The salt cake sprinkled; then amid them all
6150	The monarch Agamemnon pray'd aloud:
6150	"""Most great, most glorious Jove! who dwell'st on high,"
6150	In clouds and darkness veil'd, grant Thou that ere
6150	This sun shall set, and night o'erspread the earth,
6150	I may the haughty walls of Priam's house
6150	Lay prostrate in the dust; and burn with fire
6150	His lofty gates; and strip from Hector's breast
6150	His sword-rent tunic, while around his corpse
6150	"Many brave comrades, prostrate, bite the dust."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; but Saturn's son his pray'r denied;
6150	Receiv'd his off'rings, but his toils increas'd.
6150	Their pray'rs concluded, and the salt cake strewed
6150	Upon the victim's head, they drew him back,
6150	And slew, and flay'd; then cutting from the thighs
6150	The choicest pieces, and in double layers
6150	O'erspreading them with fat, above them plac'd
6150	The due meat-off'rings; these they burnt with logs
6150	Of leafless timber; and the inward parts,
6150	First to be tasted, o'er the fire they held.
6150	The thighs consum'd with fire, the inward parts
6150	They tasted first; the rest upon the spits
6150	Roasted with care, and from the fire withdrew.
6150	Their labours ended, and the feast prepar'd,
6150	They shared the social meal, nor lacked there aught.
6150	The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,
6150	Gerenian Nestor thus his speech began:
6150	"""Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6150	Great Atreus' son, no longer let us pause,
6150	The work delaying which the pow'rs of Heav'n
6150	Have trusted to our hands; do thou forthwith
6150	Bid that the heralds proclamation make,
6150	And summon through the camp the brass-clad Greeks;
6150	While, in a body, through the wide-spread ranks
6150	"We pass, and stimulate their warlike zeal."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and Agamemnon, King of men,
6150	Obedient to his counsel, gave command
6150	That to the war the clear-voic'd heralds call
6150	The long-hair'd Greeks: they gave the word, and straight
6150	From ev'ry quarter throng'd the eager crowd.
6150	The Heav'n-born Kings, encircling Atreus' son,
6150	The troops inspected: Pallas, blue-ey'd Maid,
6150	Before the chiefs her glorious aegis bore,
6150	By time untouch'd, immortal: all around
6150	A hundred tassels hung, rare works of art,
6150	All gold, each one a hundred oxen's price.
6150	With this the Goddess pass'd along the ranks,
6150	Exciting all; and fix'd in every breast
6150	The firm resolve to wage unwearied war;
6150	And dearer to their hearts than thoughts of home
6150	Or wish'd return, became the battle-field.
6150	""
6150	As when a wasting fire, on mountain tops,
6150	Hath seized the blazing woods, afar is seen
6150	The glaring light; so, as they mov'd, to Heav'n
6150	Flash'd the bright glitter of their burnish'd arms.
6150	""
6150	As when a num'rous flock of birds, or geese,
6150	Or cranes, or long-neck'd swans, on Asian mead,
6150	Beside Cayster's stream, now here, now there,
6150	Disporting, ply their wings; then settle down
6150	With clam'rous noise, that all the mead resounds;
6150	So to Scamander's plain, from tents and ships,
6150	Pour'd forth the countless tribes; the firm earth groan'd
6150	Beneath the tramp of steeds and armed men.
6150	Upon Scamander's flow'ry mead they stood,
6150	Unnumber'd as the vernal leaves and flow'rs.
6150	""
6150	Or as the multitudinous swarms of flies,
6150	That round the cattle-sheds in spring-tide pour,
6150	While the warm milk is frothing in the pail:
6150	So numberless upon the plain, array'd
6150	For Troy's destruction, stood the long-hair'd Greeks.
6150	And as experienced goat-herds, when their flocks
6150	Are mingled in the pasture, portion out
6150	Their sev'ral charges, so the chiefs array'd
6150	Their squadrons for the fight; while in the midst
6150	The mighty monarch Agamemnon mov'd:
6150	His eye, and lofty brow, the counterpart
6150	Of Jove, the Lord of thunder; in his girth
6150	Another Mars, with Neptune's ample chest.
6150	As 'mid the thronging heifers in a herd
6150	Stands, proudly eminent, the lordly bull;
6150	So, by Jove's will, stood eminent that day,
6150	'Mid many heroes, Atreus' godlike son.
6150	""
6150	Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell,

6150	Were present, and know all things: we ourselves

6150	Who think thee, from thine outward show, a chief
6150	Among our warriors; but thou hast in truth
6150	Nor strength of mind, nor courage in the fight.
6150	How was't that such as thou could e'er induce
6150	A noble band, in ocean-going ships
6150	To cross the main, with men of other lands
6150	Mixing in amity, and bearing thence

6150	Of triumph to thy foes, contempt to thee!
6150	Durst thou the warlike Menelaus meet,

6150	Whose bride thou didst not fear to bear away:

6150	Or Venus' gifts of beauty and of grace,
6150	Or, trampled in the dust, thy flowing hair.
6150	But too forbearing are the men of Troy;
6150	Else for the ills that thou hast wrought the state,
6150	"Ere now thy body had in stone been cas'd."""

6150	To whom the godlike Paris thus replied:

6150	That in a strong man's hand, who fashions out
6150	Some naval timber, with unbated edge
6150	Cleaves the firm wood, and aids the striker's force;
6150	Ev'n so unwearied is thy warlike soul.
6150	Yet blame not me for golden Venus' gifts:
6150	The gifts of Heav'n are not to be despis'd,
6150	Which Heav'n may give, but man could not command.

6150	"For noble steeds and lovely women fam'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and Hector joy'd to hear his words:
6150	Forth in the midst he stepp'd, and with his spear
6150	Grasp'd by the middle, stay'd the Trojan ranks.
6150	At him the long-haired Grecians bent their bows,
6150	Prompt to assail with arrows and with stones;
6150	But loud the monarch Agamemnon's voice
6150	"Was heard; ""Hold, Argives, hold! ye sons of Greece,"
6150	Shoot not! for Hector of the glancing helm
6150	"Hath, as it seems, some message to impart."""
6150	""
6150	He said; they held their hands, and silent stood
6150	Expectant, till to both thus Hector spoke:
6150	"""Hear now, ye Trojans, and ye well-greav'd Greeks,"
6150	The words of Paris, cause of all this war.
6150	He asks through me that all the host of Troy
6150	And Grecian warriors shall upon the ground
6150	Lay down their glitt'ring arms; while in the midst
6150	The warlike Menelaus and himself
6150	Stand front to front, for Helen and the spoils
6150	Of war to combat; and whoe'er shall prove
6150	The better man in conflict, let him bear
6150	The woman and the spoils in triumph home,
6150	"While we, the rest, firm peace and friendship swear."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Hector spoke; the rest in silence heard;
6150	But Menelaus, bold in fight, replied:
6150	"""Hear now my answer; in this quarrel I"
6150	May claim the chiefest share; and now I hope
6150	Trojans and Greeks may see the final close
6150	Of all the labours ye so long have borne
6150	T' avenge my wrong, at Paris' hand sustain'd.
6150	And of us two whiche'er is doom'd to death,
6150	So let him die! the rest, depart in peace.
6150	Bring then two lambs, one white, the other black,
6150	For Tellus and for Sol; we on our part
6150	Will bring another, for Saturnian Jove:
6150	And let the majesty of Priam too
6150	Appear, himself to consecrate our oaths,
6150	(For reckless are his sons, and void of faith,)
6150	That none Jove's oath may dare to violate.
6150	For young men's spirits are too quickly stirr'd;
6150	But in the councils check'd by rev'rend age,
6150	Alike are weigh'd the future and the past,
6150	"And for all int'rests due provision made."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and Greeks and Trojans gladly heard,
6150	In hopes of respite from the weary war.
6150	They rang'd the cars in ranks; and they themselves
6150	Descending doff'd their arms, and laid them down
6150	Close each by each, with narrow space between.
6150	Two heralds to the city Hector sent
6150	To bring the lambs, and aged Priam call;
6150	While Agamemnon to the hollow ships,
6150	Their lamb to bring, in haste Talthybius sent:
6150	He heard, and straight the monarch's voice obey'd.
6150	""
6150	Meantime to white-arm'd Helen Iris sped,
6150	The heav'nly messenger: in form she seem'd
6150	Her husband's sister, whom Antenor's son,
6150	The valiant Helicaon had to wife,
6150	Laodice, of Priam's daughters all
6150	Loveliest of face: she in her chamber found
6150	Her whom she sought: a mighty web she wove,
6150	Of double woof and brilliant hues; whereon
6150	Was interwoven many a toilsome strife
6150	Of Trojan warriors and of brass-clad Greeks,
6150	For her encounter'd at the hand of Mars.
6150	Beside her Iris stood, and thus she spoke:
6150	"""Come, sister dear, and see the glorious deeds"
6150	Of Trojan warriors and of brass-clad Greeks.
6150	They who erewhile, impatient for the fight,
6150	Roll'd o'er the plain the woful tide of war,
6150	Now silent sit, the storm of battle hush'd,
6150	Reclining on their shields, their lances bright
6150	Beside them reared; while Paris in the midst
6150	And warlike Menelaus, stand prepar'd
6150	With the long spear for thee to fight; thyself
6150	"The prize of conquest and the victor's wife."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as she spoke, in Helen's breast arose
6150	Fond recollection of her former Lord,
6150	Her home, and parents; o'er her head she threw
6150	A snowy veil; and shedding tender tears
6150	She issu'd forth, not unaccompanied;
6150	For with her went fair AEthra, Pittheus' child,
6150	And stag-ey'd Clymene, her maidens twain.
6150	They quickly at the Scaean gate arriv'd.
6150	""
6150	Attending there on aged Priam, sat,
6150	The Elders of the city; Panthous,
6150	And Lampus, and Thymaetes; Clytius,
6150	Bold Icetaon, and Ucalegon,
6150	With sage Antenor, wise in council both:
6150	All these were gather'd at the Scaean gate;
6150	By age exempt from war, but in discourse
6150	Abundant, as the cricket, that on high
6150	From topmost boughs of forest tree sends forth
6150	His delicate music; so on Ilium's tow'rs
6150	Sat the sage chiefs and councillors of Troy.
6150	Helen they saw, as to the tow'r she came;
6150	"And ""'tis no marvel,"" one to other said,"
6150	"""The valiant Trojans and the well-greav'd Greeks"
6150	For beauty such as this should long endure
6150	The toils of war; for goddess-like she seems;
6150	And yet, despite her beauty, let her go,
6150	"Nor bring on us and on our sons a curse."""
6150	""
6150	Thus they; but aged Priam Helen call'd:
6150	"""Come here, my child, and sitting by my side,"
6150	From whence thou canst discern thy former Lord,
6150	His kindred, and thy friends (not thee I blame,
6150	But to the Gods I owe this woful war),
6150	Tell me the name of yonder mighty chief
6150	Among the Greeks a warrior brave and strong:
6150	Others in height surpass him; but my eyes
6150	A form so noble never yet beheld,
6150	"Nor so august; he moves, a King indeed!"""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer, Helen, heav'nly fair:
6150	"""With rev'rence, dearest father, and with shame"
6150	I look on thee: oh would that I had died
6150	That day when hither with thy son I came,
6150	And left my husband, friends, and darling child,
6150	And all the lov'd companions of my youth:
6150	That I died not, with grief I pine away.
6150	But to thy question; I will tell thee true;
6150	Yon chief is Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
6150	Wide-reigning, mighty monarch, ruler good,
6150	And valiant warrior; in my husband's name,
6150	"Lost as I am, I call'd him brother once."""
6150	""
6150	She spoke: th' old man admiring gaz'd, and cried,
6150	"""Oh bless'd Atrides, child of happy fate,"
6150	Favour'd of Heav'n! how many noble Greeks
6150	Obey thy rule! In vine-clad Phrygia once
6150	I saw the hosts of Phrygian warriors wheel
6150	Their rapid steeds; and with them, all the bands
6150	Of Otreus, and of Mygdon, godlike King,
6150	Who lay encamp'd beside Sangarius' stream:
6150	I too with them was number'd, in the day
6150	When met them in the field the Amazons,
6150	The woman-warriors; but their forces all
6150	"Reach'd not the number of the keen-ey'd Greeks."""
6150	""
6150	Ulysses next the old man saw, and ask'd,
6150	"""Tell me again, dear child, who this may be,"
6150	In stature less than Atreus' royal son,
6150	But broader-shoulder'd, and of ampler chest.
6150	His arms are laid upon the fertile plain,
6150	But he himself is moving through the ranks,
6150	Inspecting, like a full-fleec'd ram, that moves
6150	"Majestic through a flock of snow-white ewes."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Jove's offspring, Helen, thus replied:
6150	"""The wise Ulysses that, Laertes' son:"
6150	Though bred in rugged Ithaca, yet vers'd
6150	"In ev'ry stratagem, and deep device."""
6150	"""O woman,"" then the sage Antenor said,"
6150	"""Of these thy words I can the truth avouch;"
6150	For hither when on thine account to treat,
6150	Brave Menelaus and Ulysses came,
6150	I lodg'd them in my house, and lov'd them both,
6150	And studied well the form and mind of each.
6150	As they with Trojans mix'd in social guise,
6150	When both were standing, o'er his comrade high
6150	With broad-set shoulders Menelaus stood;
6150	Seated, Ulysses was the nobler form:
6150	Then, in the great Assembly, when to all
6150	Their public speech and argument they fram'd,
6150	In fluent language Menelaus spoke,
6150	In words though few, yet clear; though young in years,
6150	No wordy babbler, wasteful of his speech:
6150	But when the skill'd Ulysses rose to speak,
6150	With down-cast visage would he stand, his eyes
6150	Bent on the ground; the staff he bore, nor back
6150	He wav'd, nor forward, but like one untaught,
6150	He held it motionless; who only saw
6150	Would say that he was mad, or void of sense;
6150	But when his chest its deep-ton'd voice sent forth,
6150	With words that fell like flakes of wintry snow,
6150	No mortal with Ulysses could compare:
6150	"Then little reck'd we of his outward show."""
6150	""
6150	At sight of Ajax next th' old man enquir'd;
6150	"""Who is yon other warrior, brave and strong,"
6150	"Tow'ring o'er all with head and shoulders broad?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom, in answer, Helen, heav'nly fair:
6150	"""Gigantic Ajax that, the prop of Greece;"
6150	And by his side Idomeneus of Crete
6150	Stands godlike, circled round by Cretan chiefs.
6150	The warlike Menelaus welcom'd him
6150	Oft in our palace, when from Crete he came.
6150	Now all the other keen-ey'd Greeks I see,
6150	Whom once I knew, and now could call by name;
6150	But two I miss, two captains of the host,
6150	My own two brethren, and my mother's sons,
6150	Castor and Pollux; Castor, charioteer
6150	Unrivalled, Pollux, matchless pugilist.
6150	In Lacedaemon have they stay'd behind?
6150	Or can it be, in ocean-going ships
6150	That they have come indeed, but shun to join
6150	The fight of warriors, fearful of the shame,
6150	"And deep disgrace that on my name attend?"""
6150	Thus she; but they beneath the teeming earth
6150	In Lacedaemon lay, their native land.
6150	""
6150	Meanwhile the heralds through the city bore
6150	The treaty off'rings to the Gods; the lambs,
6150	And genial wine, the produce of the soil,
6150	In goat-skin flasks: therewith a flagon bright,
6150	And cups of gold, Idaeus brought, and stood
6150	Beside the aged King, as thus he spoke:
6150	"""Son of Laomedon, arise! the chiefs"
6150	Of Trojan warriors and of brass-clad Greeks
6150	Call for thy presence on the battle-plain
6150	To swear a truce; where Paris in the midst
6150	And warlike Menelaus stand prepar'd
6150	With the long spear for Helen and the spoils
6150	Of war to combat, that whoe'er may prove
6150	The better man in fight, may bear away
6150	The woman and the spoils in triumph home;
6150	While we, the rest, in peace and friendship sworn,
6150	Shall still possess the fertile plains of Troy;
6150	And to their native Argos they return.
6150	"For noble steeds and lovely women fam'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said; the old man shuddered at his words:
6150	But to his comrades gave command forthwith.
6150	To yoke his car; and they his word obey'd.
6150	Priam, ascending, gather'd up the reins,
6150	And with Antenor by his side, the twain
6150	Drove through the Scaean gate their flying steeds.
6150	""
6150	But when between th' opposing ranks they came,
6150	Alighting from the car, they mov'd on foot
6150	Between the Trojan and the Grecian hosts.
6150	Uprose then Agamemnon, King of men,
6150	Uprose the sage Ulysses; to the front
6150	The heralds brought the off'rings to the Gods,
6150	And in the flagon mix'd the wine, and pour'd
6150	The hallowing water on the monarchs' hands.
6150	His dagger then the son of Atreus drew,
6150	Suspended, as was wont, beside the hilt
6150	Of his great sword; and from the victim's head
6150	He cut the sacred lock, which to the chiefs
6150	Of Troy and Greece the heralds portion'd out.
6150	Then with uplifted hands he pray'd aloud:
6150	"""O Father Jove! who rul'st from Ida's height,"
6150	Most great! most glorious! and thou Sun, who see'st
6150	And hearest all things! Rivers! and thou Earth!
6150	And ye, who after death beneath the earth
6150	Your vengeance wreak on souls of men forsworn,
6150	Be witness ye, and this our cov'nant guard.
6150	If Menelaus fall by Paris' hand,
6150	Let him retain both Helen and the spoil,
6150	While in our ships we take our homeward way;
6150	If Paris be by Menelaus slain,
6150	Troy shall surrender Helen and the spoil,
6150	With compensation due to Greece, that so
6150	A record may to future days remain.
6150	But, Paris slain, if Priam and his sons
6150	The promis'd compensation shall withhold,
6150	Then here, my rights in battle to assert,
6150	"Will I remain, till I the end achieve."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, across the victims' throats
6150	He drew the pitiless blade, and on the ground
6150	He laid them gasping, as the stream of life
6150	Pour'd forth, their vigour by the blade subdued.
6150	Then, from the flagon drawn, from out the cups
6150	The wine they pour'd; and to th' eternal Gods
6150	They pray'd; and thus from Trojans and from Greeks
6150	"Arose the joint petition; ""Grant, O Jove!"
6150	Most great! most glorious! grant, ye heav'nly pow'rs,
6150	That whosoe'er this solemn truce shall break,
6150	Ev'n as this wine we pour, their hearts' best blood,
6150	Theirs and their children's, on the earth be pour'd,
6150	"And strangers in subjection take their wives!"""
6150	""
6150	Thus they; but Jove, unyielding, heard their pray'r.
6150	The rites perform'd, then aged Priam spoke:
6150	"""Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye well-greav'd Greeks!"
6150	To Ilium's breezy heights I now withdraw,
6150	For that mine eyes will not endure the sight
6150	Of warlike Menelaus and my son
6150	Engag'd in deadly combat; of the two
6150	Which may be doom'd to death, is only known
6150	"To Jove, and to th' immortal pow'rs of Heav'n."""
6150	""
6150	Thus spoke the godlike King; and on the car
6150	He plac'd the consecrated lambs; himself
6150	Ascending then, he gather'd up the reins,
6150	And with Antenor by his side, the twain
6150	To Ilium's walls retrac'd their homeward way.
6150	""
6150	Then Hector, son of Priam, measur'd out,
6150	With sage Ulysses join'd, th' allotted space;
6150	Next, in the brass-bound helmet cast the lots,
6150	Which of the two the first should throw the spear.
6150	The crowd, with hands uplifted, to the Gods,
6150	Trojans and Greeks alike, address'd their pray'r:
6150	"""O Father Jove! who rul'st from Ida's height,"
6150	Most great! most glorious! grant that whosoe'er
6150	On both our armies hath this turmoil brought
6150	May undergo the doom of death, and we,
6150	"The rest, firm peace and lasting friendship swear."""
6150	""
6150	Thus they; great Hector of the glancing helm,
6150	With eyes averted, shook the casque; and forth
6150	Was cast the lot of Paris; on the ground
6150	The rest lay down by ranks, where near to each
6150	Were rang'd his active steeds, and glitt'ring arms.
6150	Then o'er his shoulders fair-hair'd Helen's Lord,
6150	The godlike Paris, donn'd his armour bright:
6150	First on his legs the well-wrought greaves he fix'd,
6150	Fasten'd with silver clasps; his ample chest
6150	A breastplate guarded, by Lycaon lent,
6150	His brother, but which fitted well his form.
6150	Around his shoulders slung, his sword he bore,
6150	Brass-bladed, silver-studded; then his shield
6150	Weighty and strong; and on his firm-set head
6150	A helm he wore, well wrought, with horsehair plume
6150	That nodded, fearful, o'er his brow; his hand
6150	Grasp'd the firm spear, familiar to his hold.
6150	Prepar'd alike the adverse warrior stood.
6150	""
6150	They, from the crowd apart their armour donn'd,
6150	Came forth: and each, with eyes of mutual hate,
6150	Regarded each: admiring wonder seiz'd
6150	The Trojan warriors and the well-greav'd Greeks,
6150	As in the centre of the measur'd ground
6150	They stood oppos'd, and pois'd their quiv'ring spears.
6150	First Paris threw his weighty spear, and struck
6150	Fair in the midst Atrides' buckler round,
6150	But broke not through; upon the stubborn targe
6150	Was bent the lance's point; then thus to Jove,
6150	His weapon hurling, Menelaus pray'd:
6150	"""Great King, on him who wrought me causeless wrong,"
6150	On Paris, grant that retribution due
6150	My arm may bring; that men in days to come
6150	May fear their host to injure, and repay
6150	"With treach'rous wile his hospitable cares."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and poising, hurl'd his weighty spear:
6150	Full in the midst it struck the buckler round;
6150	Right through the buckler pass'd the sturdy spear,
6150	And through the gorgeous breastplate, and within
6150	Cut through the linen vest; but Paris, back
6150	Inclining, stoop'd, and shunn'd the doom of death.
6150	""
6150	Atrides then his silver-studded sword
6150	Rearing on high, a mighty blow let fall
6150	On Paris' helm; but shiv'ring in his hand
6150	In countless fragments new the faithless blade.
6150	Then thus to Jove, with eyes uplift to Heav'n,
6150	"Atrides made his moan: ""O Father Jove!"
6150	Of all the Gods, the most unfriendly thou!
6150	On Paris' head I hop'd for all his crimes
6150	To wreak my vengeance due; but in my grasp
6150	My faithless sword is shatter'd, and my spear
6150	"Hath bootless left my hand, nor reached my foe."""
6150	Then onward rushing, by the horsehair plume
6150	He seiz'd his foeman's helm, and wrenching round
6150	Dragg'd by main force amid the well-greav'd Greeks.
6150	The broider'd strap, that, pass'd beneath his beard,
6150	The helmet held, the warrior's throat compress'd:
6150	Then had Atrides dragg'd him from the field,
6150	And endless fame acquir'd; but Venus, child
6150	Of Jove, her fav'rite's peril quickly saw.
6150	And broke the throttling strap of tough bull's hide.
6150	In the broad hand the empty helm remained.
6150	The trophy, by their champion whirl'd amid
6150	The well-greav'd Greeks, his eager comrades seiz'd;
6150	While he, infuriate, rush'd with murd'rous aim
6150	On Priam's son; but him, the Queen of Love
6150	(As Gods can only) from the field convey'd,
6150	Wrapt in a misty cloud; and on a couch,
6150	Sweet perfumes breathing, gently laid him down;
6150	Then went in search of Helen; her she found,
6150	Circled with Trojan dames, on Ilium's tow'r:
6150	Her by her airy robe the Goddess held,
6150	And in the likeness of an aged dame
6150	Who oft for her, in Sparta when she dwelt,
6150	Many a fair fleece had wrought, and lov'd her well,
6150	"Address'd her thus: ""Come, Helen, to thy house;"
6150	Come, Paris calls thee; in his chamber he
6150	Expects thee, resting on luxurious couch,
6150	In costly garb, with manly beauty grac'd:
6150	Not from the fight of warriors wouldst thou deem
6150	He late had come, but for the dance prepar'd,
6150	"Or resting from the dance's pleasing toil."""
6150	""
6150	She said, and Helen's spirit within her mov'd;
6150	And when she saw the Goddess' beauteous neck,
6150	Her lovely bosom, and her glowing eyes,
6150	She gaz'd in wonder, and address'd her thus:
6150	"""Oh why, great Goddess, make me thus thy sport?"
6150	Seek'st thou to bear me far away from hence
6150	To some fair Phrygian or Maeonian town,
6150	If there some mortal have thy favour gain'd?
6150	Or, for that Menelaus in the field
6150	Hath vanquish'd Paris, and is willing yet
6150	That I, his bane, should to his home return;
6150	Here art thou found, to weave again thy wiles!
6150	Go then thyself! thy godship abdicate!
6150	Renounce Olympus! lavish here on him
6150	Thy pity and thy care! he may perchance
6150	Make thee his wife--at least his paramour!
6150	But thither go not I! foul shame it were
6150	Again to share his bed; the dames of Troy
6150	Will for a byword hold me; and e'en now
6150	"My soul with endless sorrow is possess'd."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in anger heav'nly Venus spoke:
6150	"""Incense me not, poor fool! lest I in wrath"
6150	Desert thee quite, and as I heretofore
6150	Have lov'd, so make thee object of my hate;
6150	And kindle, 'twixt the Trojans and the Greeks,
6150	"Such bitter feuds, as both shall wreak on thee."""
6150	""
6150	She said; and trembled Helen, child of Jove;
6150	She rose in silence; in a snow-white veil
6150	All glitt'ring, shrouded; by the Goddess led
6150	She pass'd, unnotic'd by the Trojan dames.
6150	But when to Paris' splendid house they came,
6150	Thronging around her, her attendants gave
6150	Their duteous service; through the lofty hall
6150	With queenly grace the godlike woman pass'd.
6150	A seat the laughter-loving Goddess plac'd
6150	By Paris' side; there Helen sat, the child
6150	Of aegis-bearing Jove, with downcast eyes,
6150	Yet with sharp words she thus address'd her Lord:
6150	"""Back from the battle? would thou there hadst died"
6150	Beneath a warrior's arm, whom once I call'd
6150	My husband! vainly didst thou boast erewhile
6150	Thine arm, thy dauntless courage, and thy spear
6150	The warlike Menelaus should subdue!
6150	Go now again, and challenge to the fight
6150	The warlike Menelaus. Be thou ware!
6150	I warn thee, pause, ere madly thou presume
6150	With fair-hair'd Menelaus to contend!
6150	"Soon shouldst thou fall beneath his conqu'ring spear."""
6150	""
6150	"To whom thus Paris: ""Wring not thus my soul"
6150	With keen reproaches: now, with Pallas' aid,
6150	Hath Menelaus conquer'd; but my day
6150	Will come: I too can boast my guardian Gods.
6150	But turn we now to love, and love's delights;
6150	For never did thy beauty so inflame
6150	My sense; not when from Lacedaemon first
6150	I bore thee in my ocean-going ships,
6150	And revell'd in thy love on Cranae's isle,
6150	"As now it fills my soul with fond desire."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and led her to the nuptial couch;
6150	Her Lord she follow'd; and while there reclin'd
6150	Upon the richly-inlaid couch they lay,
6150	Atrides, like a lion baffled, rush'd
6150	Amid the crowd, if haply he might find
6150	The godlike Paris; but not one of all
6150	The Trojans and their brave allies could aid
6150	The warlike Menelaus in his search;
6150	Not that, for love, would any one that knew
6150	Have screen'd him from his anger, for they all
6150	Abhorr'd him as the shade of death: then thus
6150	Outspoke great Agamemnon, King of men:
6150	"""Hear me, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies!"
6150	With warlike Menelaus rests, 'tis plain,
6150	The prize of vict'ry: then surrender ye
6150	The Argive Helen and the spoils of war,
6150	With compensation due to Greece, that so
6150	"A record may to future days remain."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; the Greeks, assenting, cheer'd his words.

6150	""
6150	""
6150	ARGUMENT.
6150	""
6150	THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	The Gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree
6150	upon the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break
6150	the truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is
6150	wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the mean time some of the Trojan
6150	troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts
6150	of a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some
6150	by praises, and others by reproofs. Nestor is particularly celebrated
6150	for his military discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers are
6150	slain on both sides.
6150	""
6150	The same day continues through this, as through the last book; as it
6150	does also through the two following, and almost to the end of the
6150	seventh book. The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	""
6150	""
6150	BOOK IV.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	On golden pavement, round the board of Jove,
6150	The Gods were gather'd; Hebe in the midst
6150	Pour'd the sweet nectar; they, in golden cups,
6150	Each other pledg'd, as down they look'd on Troy.
6150	Then Jove, with cutting words and taunting tone,
6150	Began the wrath of Juno to provoke:
6150	"""Two Goddesses for Menelaus fight,"
6150	Thou, Juno, Queen of Argos, and with thee
6150	Minerva, shield of warriors; but ye two
6150	Sitting aloof, well-pleased it seems, look on;
6150	While laughter-loving Venus, at the side
6150	Of Paris standing, still averts his fate,
6150	And rescues, when, as now, expecting death.
6150	To warlike Menelaus we decree,
6150	Of right, the vict'ry; but consult we now
6150	What may the issue be; if we shall light
6150	Again the name of war and discord fierce,
6150	Or the two sides in peace and friendship join.
6150	For me, if thus your gen'ral voice incline,
6150	Let Priam's city stand, and Helen back
6150	"To warlike Menelaus be restor'd."""
6150	""
6150	So spoke the God; but seated side by side,
6150	Juno and Pallas glances interchang'd
6150	Of ill portent for Troy; Pallas indeed
6150	Sat silent; and, though inly wroth with Jove,
6150	Yet answer'd not a word; but Juno's breast
6150	Could not contain her rage, and thus she spoke:
6150	"""What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
6150	How wouldst thou render vain, and void of fruit,
6150	My weary labour and my horses' toil,
6150	To stir the people, and on Priam's self,
6150	And Priam's offspring, bring disastrous fate?
6150	"Do as thou wilt! yet not with our consent."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, in wrath, the Cloud-compeller thus:
6150	"""Revengeful! how have Priam and his sons"
6150	So deeply injur'd thee, that thus thou seek'st
6150	With unabated anger to pursue,
6150	Till thou o'erthrow, the strong-built walls of Troy?
6150	Couldst thou but force the gates, and entering in
6150	On Priam's mangled flesh, and Priam's sons,
6150	And Trojans all, a bloody banquet make.
6150	Perchance thy fury might at length be stayed.
6150	But have thy will, lest this in future times
6150	'Twixt me and thee be cause of strife renew'd.
6150	Yet hear my words, and ponder what I say:
6150	If e'er, in times to come, my will should be
6150	Some city to destroy, inhabited
6150	By men beloved of thee, seek not to turn
6150	My wrath aside, but yield, as I do now,
6150	Consenting, but with heart that ill consents;
6150	For of all cities fair, beneath the sun
6150	And starry Heaven, the abode of mortal men,
6150	None to my soul was dear as sacred Troy,
6150	And Priam's self, and Priam's warrior race.
6150	For with drink-off'rings due, and fat of lambs,
6150	My altar still hath at their hands been fed;
6150	"Such honour hath to us been ever paid."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the stag-ey'd Juno thus replied:
6150	"""Three cities are there, dearest to my heart;"
6150	Argos, and Sparta, and the ample streets
6150	Of rich Mycenae; work on them thy will;
6150	Destroy them, if thine anger they incur;
6150	I will not interpose, nor hinder thee;
6150	Mourn them I shall; reluctant see their fall,
6150	But not resist; for sovereign is thy will.
6150	Yet should my labours not be fruitless all;
6150	For I too am a God; my blood is thine;
6150	Worthy of honour, as the eldest born
6150	Of deep-designing Saturn, and thy wife;
6150	Thine, who o'er all th' Immortals reign'st supreme.
6150	But yield we each to other, I to thee,
6150	And thou to me; the other Gods will all
6150	By us be rul'd. On Pallas then enjoin
6150	That to the battle-field of Greece and Troy
6150	She haste, and so contrive that Trojans first
6150	"May break the treaty, and the Greeks assail."""
6150	""
6150	She said: the Sire of Gods and men complied,
6150	And thus with winged words to Pallas spoke:
6150	"""Go to the battle-field of Greece and Troy"
6150	In haste, and so contrive that Trojans first
6150	"May break the treaty, and the Greeks assail."""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh impulse gave to Pallas' zeal,
6150	And from Olympus' heights in haste she sped;
6150	Like to a meteor, that, of grave portent
6150	To warring armies or sea-faring men,
6150	The son of deep-designing Saturn sends,
6150	Bright-flashing, scatt'ring fiery sparks around,
6150	The blue-ey'd Goddess darted down to earth,
6150	And lighted in the midst; amazement held
6150	The Trojan warriors and the well-greav'd Greeks;
6150	"And one to other look'd and said, ""What means"
6150	This sign? Must fearful battle rage again,
6150	Or may we hope for gentle peace from Jove,
6150	"Who to mankind dispenses peace and war?"""
6150	Such was the converse Greeks and Trojans held.
6150	Pallas meanwhile, amid the Trojan host,
6150	Clad in the likeness of Antenor's son,
6150	Laodocus, a spearman stout and brave,
6150	Search'd here and there, if haply she might find
6150	The godlike Pandarus; Lycaon's son
6150	She found, of noble birth and stalwart form,
6150	Standing, encircled by his sturdy band
6150	Of bucklered followers from AEsepus' stream,
6150	She stood beside him, and address'd him thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Wilt thou by me be ruled, Lycaon's son?"
6150	For durst thou but at Menelaus shoot
6150	Thy winged arrow, great would be thy fame,
6150	And great thy favour with the men of Troy,
6150	And most of all with Paris; at his hand
6150	Thou shalt receive rich guerdon, when he hears
6150	That warlike Menelaus, by thy shaft
6150	Subdued, is laid upon the fun'ral pyre.
6150	Bend then thy bow at Atreus' glorious son,
6150	Vowing to Phoebus, Lycia's guardian God,
6150	The Archer-King, to pay of firstling lambs
6150	An ample hecatomb, when home return'd
6150	"In safety to Zeleia's sacred town."""
6150	Thus she; and, fool, he listen'd to her words.
6150	Straight he uncas'd his polish'd bow, his spoil
6150	Won from a mountain ibex, which himself,
6150	In ambush lurking, through the breast had shot,
6150	True to his aim, as from behind a crag
6150	He came in sight; prone on the rock he fell;
6150	With horns of sixteen palms his head was crown'd;
6150	These deftly wrought a skilful workman's hand,
6150	And polish'd smooth, and tipp'd the ends with gold.
6150	He bent, and resting on the ground his bow,
6150	Strung it anew; his faithful comrades held
6150	Their shields before him, lest the sons of Greece
6150	Should make their onset ere his shaft could reach
6150	The warlike Menelaus, Atreus' son.
6150	His quiver then withdrawing from its case,
6150	With care a shaft he chose, ne'er shot before,
6150	Well-feather'd, messenger of pangs and death;
6150	The stinging arrow fitted to the string,
6150	And vow'd to Phoebus, Lycia's guardian God,
6150	The Archer-King, to pay of firstling lambs
6150	An ample hecatomb, when home return'd
6150	In safety to Zeleia's sacred town.
6150	At once the sinew and the notch he drew;
6150	The sinew to his breast, and to the bow
6150	The iron head; then, when the mighty bow
6150	Was to a circle strain'd, sharp rang the horn,
6150	And loud the sinew twang'd, as tow'rd the crowd
6150	With deadly speed the eager arrow sprang.
6150	""
6150	Nor, Menelaus, was thy safety then
6150	Uncar'd for of the Gods; Jove's daughter first,
6150	Pallas, before thee stood, and turn'd aside
6150	The pointed arrow; turn'd it so aside
6150	As when a mother from her infant's cheek,
6150	Wrapt in sweet slumbers, brushes off a fly;
6150	Its course she so directed that it struck
6150	Just where the golden clasps the belt restrain'd,
6150	And where the breastplate, doubled, check'd its force.
6150	On the close-fitting belt the arrow struck;
6150	Right through the belt of curious workmanship
6150	It drove, and through the breastplate richly wrought,
6150	And through the coat of mail he wore beneath,
6150	His inmost guard and best defence to check
6150	The hostile weapons' force; yet onward still
6150	The arrow drove, and graz'd the hero's flesh.
6150	Forth issued from the wound the crimson blood.
6150	As when some Carian or Maeonian maid,
6150	With crimson dye the ivory stains, designed
6150	To be the cheek-piece of a warrior's steed,
6150	By many a valiant horseman coveted,
6150	As in the house it lies, a monarch's boast,
6150	The horse adorning, and the horseman's pride:
6150	So, Menelaus, then thy graceful thighs,
6150	And knees, and ancles, with thy blood were dy'd.
6150	""
6150	Great Agamemnon shudder'd as he saw
6150	The crimson drops out-welling from the wound;
6150	Shudder'd the warlike Menelaus' self;
6150	But when not buried in his flesh he saw
6150	The barb and sinew, back his spirit came.
6150	""
6150	Then deeply groaning, Agamemnon spoke,
6150	As Menelaus by the hand he held,
6150	"And with him groan'd his comrades: ""Brother dear,"
6150	I wrought thy death when late, on compact sworn,
6150	I sent thee forth alone for Greece to fight;
6150	Wounded by Trojans, who their plighted faith
6150	Have trodden under foot; but not in vain
6150	Are solemn cov'nants and the blood of lambs,
6150	The treaty wine outpoured, and hand-plight given,
6150	Wherein men place their trust; if not at once,
6150	Yet soon or late will Jove assert their claim;
6150	And heavy penalties the perjured pay
6150	With their own blood, their children's, and their wives'.
6150	So in my inmost soul full well I know
6150	The day shall come when this imperial Troy,
6150	And Priam's race, and Priam's royal self,
6150	Shall in one common ruin be o'erthrown;
6150	And Saturn's son himself, high-throned Jove,
6150	Who dwells in Heav'n, shall in their faces flash
6150	His aegis dark and dread, this treach'rous deed
6150	Avenging; this shall surely come to pass.
6150	But, Menelaus, deep will be my grief,
6150	If thou shouldst perish, meeting thus thy fate.
6150	To thirsty Argos should I then return
6150	By foul disgrace o'erwhelm'd; for, with thy fall,
6150	The Greeks will mind them of their native land;
6150	And as a trophy to the sons of Troy
6150	The Argive Helen leave; thy bones meanwhile
6150	Shall moulder here beneath a foreign soil.
6150	Thy work undone; and with insulting scorn
6150	Some vaunting Trojan, leaping on the tomb
6150	Of noble Menelaus, thus shall say:
6150	'On all his foes may Agamemnon so
6150	His wrath accomplish, who hath hither led
6150	Of Greeks a mighty army, all in vain;
6150	And bootless home with empty ships hath gone,
6150	And valiant Menelaus left behind;'
6150	"Thus when men speak, gape, earth, and hide my shame."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the fair-hair'd Menelaus thus
6150	"With, cheering words: ""Fear not thyself, nor cause"
6150	The troops to fear: the arrow hath not touch'd
6150	A vital part: the sparkling belt hath first
6150	Turn'd it aside, the doublet next beneath,
6150	"And coat of mail, the work of arm'rer's hands."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
6150	"""Dear Menelaus, may thy words be true!"
6150	The leech shall tend thy wound, and spread it o'er
6150	"With healing ointments to assuage the pain."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and to the sacred herald call'd:
6150	"""Haste thee, Talthybius! summon with all speed"
6150	The son of AEsculapius, peerless leech,
6150	Machaon; bid him hither haste to see
6150	The warlike Menelaus, chief of Greeks,
6150	Who by an arrow from some practis'd hand,
6150	Trojan or Lycian, hath receiv'd a wound;
6150	"A cause of boast to them, to us of grief."""
6150	""
6150	He said, nor did the herald not obey,
6150	But through the brass-clad ranks of Greece he pass'd,
6150	In search of brave Machaon; him he found
6150	Standing, by buckler'd warriors bold begirt,
6150	Who follow'd him from Trica's grassy plains.
6150	He stood beside him, and address'd him thus:
6150	"""Up, son of AEsculapius! Atreus' son,"
6150	The mighty monarch, summons thee to see
6150	The warlike Menelaus, chief of Greeks,
6150	Who by an arrow from some practis'd hand,
6150	Trojan or Lycian, hath receiv'd a wound;
6150	"A cause of boast to them, to us of grief."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; and not unmov'd Machaon heard:
6150	They thro' the crowd, and thro' the wide-spread host,
6150	Together took their way; but when they came
6150	Where fair-hair'd Menelaus, wounded, stood,
6150	Around him in a ring the best of Greece,
6150	And in the midst the godlike chief himself,
6150	From the close-fitting belt the shaft he drew,
6150	Breaking the pointed barbs; the sparkling belt
6150	He loosen'd, and the doublet underneath,
6150	And coat of mail, the work of arm'rer's hand.
6150	But when the wound appear'd in sight, where struck
6150	The stinging arrow, from the clotted blood
6150	He cleans'd it, and applied with skilful hand
6150	The herbs of healing power, which Chiron erst
6150	In friendly guise upon his sire bestowed.
6150	""
6150	While round the valiant Menelaus they
6150	Were thus engag'd, advanc'd the Trojan hosts:
6150	They donn'd their arms, and for the fight prepar'd.
6150	In Agamemnon then no trace was seen
6150	Of laggard sloth, no shrinking from the fight,
6150	But full of ardour to the field he rush'd.
6150	He left his horses and brass-mounted car
6150	(The champing horses by Eurymedon,
6150	The son of Ptolemy, Peiraeus' son,
6150	Were held aloof), but with repeated charge
6150	Still to be near at hand, when faint with toil
6150	His limbs should fail him marshalling his host.
6150	Himself on foot the warrior ranks array'd;
6150	With cheering words addressing whom he found
6150	With zeal preparing for the battle-field:
6150	"""Relax not, valiant friends, your warlike toil;"
6150	For Jove to falsehood ne'er will give his aid;
6150	And they who first, regardless of their oaths,
6150	Have broken truce, shall with their flesh themselves
6150	The vultures feed, while we, their city raz'd,
6150	"Their wives and helpless children bear away."""
6150	""
6150	But whom remiss and shrinking from the war
6150	He found, with keen rebuke lie thus assail'd;
6150	"""Ye wretched Greeks, your country's foul reproach,"
6150	Have ye no sense of shame? Why stand ye thus
6150	Like timid fawns, that in the chase run down,
6150	Stand all bewildered, spiritless and tame?
6150	So stand ye now, nor dare to face the fight.
6150	What! will ye wait the Trojans' near approach,
6150	Where on the beach, beside the hoary deep,
6150	Our goodly ships are drawn, and see if Jove
6150	"Will o'er you his protecting hand extend?"""
6150	""
6150	As thus the King the serried ranks review'd,
6150	He came where thronging round their skilful chief
6150	Idomeneus, the warlike bands of Crete
6150	Were arming for the fight; Idomeneus,
6150	Of courage stubborn as the forest boar,
6150	The foremost ranks array'd; Meriones
6150	The rearmost squadrons had in charge; with joy
6150	The monarch Agamemnon saw, and thus
6150	With accents bland Idomeneus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Idomeneus, above all other Greeks,"
6150	In battle and elsewhere, I honour thee;
6150	And in the banquet, where the noblest mix
6150	The ruddy wine for chiefs alone reserved,
6150	Though others drink their share, yet by thy side
6150	Thy cup, like mine, still new replenished stands
6150	To drink at pleasure. Up then to the fight,
6150	"And show thyself the warrior that thou art."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cretan King, Idomeneus:
6150	"""In me, Atrides, thou shalt ever find,"
6150	As at the first I promis'd, comrade true;
6150	But go, and stir the other long-haired Greeks
6150	To speedy battle; since the Trojans now
6150	The truce have broken; and defeat and death
6150	"Must wait on those who have their oaths forsworn."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and Agamemnon went his way
6150	Rejoicing; through the crowd he pass'd, and came
6150	Where stood th' Ajaces; them, in act to arm,
6150	Amid a cloud of infantry he found;
6150	And as a goat-herd from his watch-tow'r crag
6150	Beholds a cloud advancing o'er the sea,
6150	By Zephyr's breath impell'd; as from afar
6150	He gazes, black as pitch, it sweeps along
6150	O'er the dark ocean's face, and with it brings
6150	A hurricane of rain; he, shudd'ring, sees,
6150	And drives his flock beneath the shelt'ring cave:
6150	So thick and dark, about th' Ajaces stirr'd,
6150	Impatient for the war, the stalwart youths,
6150	Black masses, bristling close with spear and shield.
6150	""
6150	Well pleas'd, the monarch Agamemnon saw,
6150	"And thus address'd them: ""Valiant chiefs, to you,"
6150	The leaders of the brass-clad Greeks, I give
6150	('Twere needless and unseemly) no commands;
6150	For well ye understand your troops to rouse
6150	To deeds of dauntless courage; would to Jove,
6150	To Pallas and Apollo, that such mind
6150	As is in you, in all the camp were found;
6150	Then soon should Priam's lofty city fall,
6150	"Tak'n and destroy'd by our victorious hands."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, them he left, and onward mov'd.
6150	Nestor, the smooth-tongu'd Pylian chief, he found
6150	The troops arraying, and to valiant deeds
6150	His friends encouraging; stout Pelagon,
6150	Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, warlike Prince,
6150	And Bias bold, his people's sure defence.
6150	In the front rank, with chariot and with horse,
6150	He plac'd the car-borne warriors; in the rear,
6150	Num'rous and brave, a cloud of infantry,
6150	Compactly mass'd, to stem the tide of war,
6150	Between the two he plac'd th' inferior troops,
6150	That e'en against their will they needs must fight.
6150	The horsemen first he charg'd, and bade them keep
6150	Their horses well in hand, nor wildly rush
6150	"Amid the tumult: ""See,"" he said, ""that none,"
6150	In skill or valour over-confident,
6150	Advance before his comrades, nor alone
6150	Retire; for so your lines were easier forc'd;
6150	But ranging each beside a hostile car,
6150	Thrust with your spears; for such the better way;
6150	By men so disciplin'd, in elder days
6150	"Were lofty walls and fenced towns destroy'd."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he, experienc'd in the wars of old;
6150	Well pleas'd, the monarch Agamemnon saw,
6150	"And thus address'd him; ""Would to Heav'n, old man,"
6150	That, as thy spirit, such too were thy strength
6150	And vigour of thy limbs; but now old age,
6150	The common lot of mortals, weighs thee down;
6150	Would I could see some others in thy place,
6150	"And thou couldst still be numbered with the young!"""
6150	""
6150	To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
6150	"""Atrides, I too fain would see restor'd"
6150	The strength I once possess'd, what time I slew
6150	The godlike Ereuthalion; but the Gods
6150	On man bestow not all their gifts at once;
6150	I then was young, and now am bow'd with age,
6150	Yet with the chariots can I still go forth,
6150	And aid with sage advice: for such the right
6150	And privilege of age; to hurl the spear
6150	Belongs to younger men, who after me
6150	"Were born, who boast their vigour unimpair'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and Agamemnon went his way,
6150	Rejoicing: to Menestheus next he came,
6150	The son of Peteus, charioteer renown'd;
6150	Him found he, circled by th' Athenian bands,
6150	The raisers of the war-cry; close beside
6150	The sage Ulysses stood, around him rang'd,
6150	Not unrenown'd, the Cephalonian troops:
6150	The sound of battle had not reach'd their ears;
6150	For but of late the Greek and Trojan hosts
6150	Were set in motion; they expecting stood,
6150	Till other Grecian columns should advance,
6150	Assail the Trojans, and renew the war.
6150	""
6150	Atrides saw, and thus, reproachful, spoke:
6150	"""O son of Peteus, Heav'n-descended King!"
6150	And thou too, master of all tricky arts,
6150	Why, ling'ring, stand ye thus aloof, and wait
6150	For others coming? ye should be the first
6150	The hot assault of battle to confront;
6150	For ye are first my summons to receive,
6150	Whene'er the honour'd banquet we prepare:
6150	And well ye like to eat the sav'ry meat,
6150	And, at your will, the luscious wine-cups drain:
6150	Now stand ye here, and unconcern'd would see
6150	"Ten columns pass before you to the fight."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, with stern regard, Ulysses thus:
6150	"""What words have pass'd the barrier of thy lips,"
6150	Atrides? how with want of warlike zeal
6150	Canst thou reproach us? when the Greeks again
6150	The furious war shall waken, thou shalt see
6150	(If that thou care to see) amid the ranks
6150	Of Troy, the father of Telemachus
6150	"In the fore-front: thy words are empty wind."""
6150	""
6150	Atrides saw him chafed, and smiling, thus
6150	"Recalled his former words: ""Ulysses sage,"
6150	Laertes' high-born son, not over-much
6150	I give thee blame, or orders; for I know
6150	Thy mind to gentle counsels is inclin'd;
6150	Thy thoughts are one with mine; then come, henceforth
6150	Shall all be well; and if a hasty word
6150	"Have pass'd, may Heaven regard it as unsaid."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, them he left, and onward mov'd.
6150	The son of Tydeus, valiant Diomed,
6150	Standing he found amid his warlike steeds
6150	And well-built cars; beside him, Sthenelus,
6150	The son of Capaneus; Atrides saw,
6150	And thus address'd him with reproachful words:
6150	"""Alas! thou son of Tydeus, wise and bold,"
6150	Why crouch with fear? why thus appall'd survey
6150	The pass of war? not so had Tydeus crouch'd;
6150	His hand was ever ready from their foes
6150	To guard his comrades; so, at least, they say
6150	Whose eyes beheld his labours; I myself
6150	Nor met him e'er, nor saw; but, by report,
6150	Thy father was the foremost man of men.
6150	A stranger to Mycenae once he came,
6150	With godlike Polynices; not at war,
6150	But seeking succour for the troops that lay
6150	Encamp'd before the sacred walls of Thebes;
6150	For reinforcements earnestly they sued;
6150	The boon they ask'd was granted them, but Jove
6150	With unpropitious omens turn'd them back.
6150	Advancing on their journey, when they reach'd
6150	Asopus' grassy banks and rushes deep,
6150	The Greeks upon a mission Tydeus sent:
6150	He went; and many Thebans there he found
6150	Feasting in Eteocles' royal hall:
6150	Amid them all, a stranger and alone,
6150	He stood unterrified, and challeng'd all
6150	To wrestle with him, and with ease o'erthrew:
6150	So mighty was the aid that Pallas gave.
6150	Whereat indignant, they, on his return,
6150	An ambush set, of fifty chosen youths;
6150	Two were their leaders; Haemon's godlike son,
6150	Maeon, and Lycophontes, warrior brave,
6150	Son of Autophonus; and these too far'd
6150	But ill at Tydeus' hand; he slew them all:
6150	Maeon alone, obedient to the Gods,
6150	He spar'd, and bade him bear the tidings home.
6150	Such Tydeus was: though greater in debate,
6150	"His son will never rival him in arms."""
6150	""
6150	He said: brave Diomed in silence heard,
6150	Submissive to the monarch's stern rebuke;
6150	Then answer'd thus the son of Capaneus:
6150	"""Atrides, speak not falsely: well thou know'st"
6150	The truth, that we our fathers far surpass.
6150	The seven-gated city, Thebes, we took,
6150	With smaller force beneath the wall of Mars,
6150	Trusting to heav'nly signs, and fav'ring Jove,
6150	Where they by blind, presumptuous folly fail'd;
6150	"Then equal not our fathers' deeds with ours."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Diomed, with stern regard:
6150	"""Father, be silent; hearken to my words:"
6150	I blame not Agamemnon, King of men,
6150	Who thus to battle stirs the well-greav'd Greeks:
6150	His will the glory be if we o'ercome
6150	The valiant Trojans, and their city take;
6150	Great too his loss if they o'er us prevail:
6150	"Then come, let us too for the fight prepare."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and from the car leap'd down in arms:
6150	Fierce rang the armour on the warrior's breast,
6150	That ev'n the stoutest heart might quail with fear.
6150	""
6150	As by the west wind driv'n, the ocean waves
6150	Dash forward on the far-resounding shore,
6150	Wave upon wave; first curls the ruffled sea
6150	With whit'ning crests; anon with thund'ring roar
6150	It breaks upon the beach, and from the crags
6150	Recoiling flings in giant curves its head
6150	Aloft, and tosses high the wild sea-spray:
6150	Column on column, so the hosts of Greece
6150	Pour'd, ceaseless, to the war; to each the chiefs
6150	Their orders gave; the rest in silence mov'd:
6150	Nor would ye deem that mighty mass endued
6150	With power of speech, so silently they moved
6150	In awe of their great captains: far around
6150	Flashed the bright armour they were girt withal.
6150	""
6150	On th' other hand, the Trojans, as the flocks
6150	That in the court-yard of some wealthy Lord
6150	In countless numbers stand, at milking-time,
6150	Incessant bleating, as their lambs they hear;
6150	So rose their mingled clamours through the camp;
6150	For not one language nor one speech was there,
6150	But many nations call'd from distant lands:
6150	These Mars inspir'd, and those the blue-ey'd Maid;
6150	And Fear, and Flight, and Discord unappeas'd,
6150	Of blood-stain'd Mars the sister and the friend:
6150	"""With humble crest at first, anon her head,"
6150	"""While yet she treads the earth, affronts the skies."
6150	The gage of battle in the midst she threw,
6150	Strode through the crowd, and woe to mortals wrought.
6150	When to the midst they came, together rush'd
6150	Bucklers and lances, and the furious might
6150	Of mail-clad warriors; bossy shield on shield
6150	Clatter'd in conflict; loud the clamour rose.
6150	Then rose too mingled shouts and groans of men
6150	Slaying and slain; the earth ran red with blood.
6150	As when, descending from the mountain's brow,
6150	Two wintry torrents, from their copious source
6150	Pour downward to the narrow pass, where meet
6150	Their mingled waters in some deep ravine,
6150	Their weight of flood; on the far mountain's side
6150	The shepherd hears the roar; so loud arose
6150	The shouts and yells of those commingling hosts.
6150	""
6150	First 'mid the foremost ranks Antilochus
6150	A Trojan warrior, Echepolus, slew,
6150	A crested chief, Thalesius' noble son.
6150	Beneath his horsehair-plumed helmet's peak
6150	The sharp spear struck; deep in his forehead fix'd
6150	It pierc'd the bone; then darkness veil'd his eyes,
6150	And, like a tow'r, amid the press he fell.
6150	Him Elephenor, brave Abantian chief,
6150	Son of Chalcodon, seizing by the feet,
6150	Dragg'd from beneath the darts, in haste to strip
6150	His armour off; but short-liv'd was th' attempt;
6150	For bold Agenor mark'd him as he drew
6150	The corpse aside, and with his brass-tipp'd spear
6150	Thrust through his flank, unguarded, as he stoop'd,
6150	Beside his shield; and slack'd his limbs in death.
6150	The spirit was fled; but hotly o'er him rag'd
6150	The war of Greeks and Trojans; fierce as wolves
6150	They fought, man struggling hand to hand with man.
6150	""
6150	Then Ajax Telamon a stalwart youth,
6150	Son of Anthemion, Simoisius, slew;
6150	Whose mother gave him birth on Simois' banks,
6150	When with her parents down from Ida's heights
6150	She drove her flock; thence Simoisius nam'd:
6150	Not destined he his parents to repay
6150	Their early care; for short his term of life,
6150	By godlike Ajax' mighty spear subdued.
6150	Him, to the front advancing, in the breast,
6150	By the right nipple, Ajax struck; right through,
6150	From front to back, the brass-tipp'd spear was driv'n,
6150	Out through the shoulder; prone in dust he fell;
6150	As some tall poplar, grown in marshy mead,
6150	Smooth-stemm'd, with branches tapering tow'rd the head;
6150	Which with the biting axe the wheelwright fells,
6150	To bend the felloes of his well-built car;
6150	Sapless, beside the river, lies the tree;
6150	So lay the youthful Simoisius, felled
6150	By godlike Ajax' hand. At him, in turn,
6150	The son of Priam, Antiphus, encas'd
6150	In radiant armour, from amid the crowd
6150	His jav'lin threw; his mark, indeed, he miss'd;
6150	But through the groin Ulysses' faithful friend,
6150	Leucus, he struck, in act to bear away
6150	The youthful dead; down on the corpse he fell,
6150	And, dying, of the dead relax'd his grasp.
6150	Fierce anger, at his comrade's slaughter, filled
6150	Ulysses' breast; in burnished armour clad
6150	Forward he rush'd; and standing near, around
6150	He look'd, and pois'd on high his glitt'ring lance:
6150	Beneath his aim the Trojans back recoil'd;
6150	Nor vainly flew the spear; Democoon,
6150	A bastard son of Priam, met the blow:
6150	He from Abydos came, his high-bred mares
6150	There left to pasture; him Ulysses, fill'd
6150	With fury at his lov'd companion's death,
6150	Smote on the head; through either temple pass'd
6150	The pointed spear, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
6150	Thund'ring he fell, and loud his armour rang.
6150	At this the Trojan chiefs, and Hector's self,
6150	'Gan to give ground: the Greeks with joyful shouts
6150	Seiz'd on the dead, and forward urg'd their course.
6150	From Ilium's heights Apollo, filled with wrath,
6150	Look'd down, and to the Trojans shouted loud:
6150	"""Uprouse ye, valiant Trojans! give not way"
6150	Before the Greeks; their bodies are not stone,
6150	Nor iron, to defy your trenchant swords;
6150	And great Achilles, fair-hair'd Thetis' son,
6150	"Fights not, but o'er his anger broods apart."""
6150	So from the city call'd the heav'nly voice;
6150	The Greeks, meanwhile, all-glorious Pallas fir'd,
6150	Mov'd 'mid the tumult, and the laggards rous'd.
6150	""
6150	Then fell Diores, Amarynceus' son:
6150	A rugged fragment of a rock had crush'd
6150	His ancle and right leg; from AEnon came
6150	The Thracian chief who hurl'd it, Peirous, son
6150	Of Imbrasus; the tendons both, and bones,
6150	The huge mass shatter'd; backward in the dust
6150	He fell, both hands extending to his friends,
6150	Gasping his life away; then quick up-ran
6150	He who the blow had dealt, and with his spear
6150	Thrust through him, by the navel; from the wound
6150	His bowels gush'd, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
6150	""
6150	But he, advancing, through the breast was struck
6150	Above the nipple, by th' AEtolian chief.
6150	Thoas; and through his lungs the spear was driv'n.
6150	Thoas approach'd, and from his breast withdrew
6150	The sturdy spear, and with his sharp-edg'd sword
6150	Across his waistband gave the mortal stroke:
6150	Yet could not touch his arms; for all around
6150	The Thracian warriors, with, their tufted crowns,
6150	Their long spears held before them, him, though stout,
6150	And strong, and valiant, kept at bay; perforce
6150	He yielded; and thus side by side were laid
6150	The two, the Thracian and th' Epeian chief;
6150	And round them many a valiant soldier lay.
6150	""
6150	Well might the deeds achieved that day deserve
6150	His praise, who through that bloody field might pass
6150	By sword or spear unwounded, by the hand
6150	Of Pallas guarded from the weapon's flight;
6150	For many a Trojan, many a Greek, that day
6150	Prone in the dust, and side by side, were laid.

6150	ARGUMENT.
6150	""
6150	THE ACTS OF DIOMED.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day's battle.
6150	Pandarus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables
6150	him to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending
6150	with any of the former, excepting Venus. AEneas joins Pandarus to
6150	oppose him, Pandarus is killed, and AEneas in great danger but for the
6150	assistance of Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is
6150	wounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and,
6150	at length, carries off AEneas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple
6150	of Pergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a
6150	stand. In the mean time AEneas is restored to the field, and they
6150	overthrow several of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by
6150	Sarpedon. Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter incites
6150	Diomed to go against that god; he wounds him, and sends him groaning to
6150	heaven.

6150	Such strength, and courage then to Diomed,
6150	The son of Tydeus, Pallas gave, as rais'd,
6150	'Mid all the Greeks, the glory of his name.
6150	Forth from his helm arid shield a fiery light
6150	There flash'd, like autumn's star, that brightest shines
6150	When newly risen from his ocean bath.
6150	So from the warrior's head and shoulders flash'd
6150	That fiery light, as to the midst he urg'd
6150	His furious course, where densest masses fought.
6150	""
6150	There was one Dares 'mid the Trojan host,
6150	The priest of Vulcan, rich, of blameless life;
6150	Two gallant sons he had, Idaeus nam'd,
6150	And Phegeus, skill'd in all the points of war.
6150	These, parted from the throng, the warrior met;
6150	They on their car, while he on foot advanc'd.
6150	When near they came, first Phegeus threw his spear;
6150	O'er the left shoulder of Tydides pass'd
6150	The erring weapon's point, and miss'd its mark.
6150	His pond'rous spear in turn Tydides threw,
6150	And not in vain; on Phegeus' breast it struck,
6150	Full in the midst, and hurl'd him from the car.
6150	Idaeus from the well-wrought chariot sprang,
6150	And fled, nor durst his brother's corpse defend.
6150	Nor had he so escap'd the doom of death,
6150	But Vulcan bore him safely from the field,
6150	In darkness shrouded, that his aged sire
6150	Might not be wholly of his sons bereav'd.
6150	The car Tydides to his comrades gave,
6150	And bade them to the ships the horses drive.
6150	""
6150	Now when the Trojans Dares' sons beheld,
6150	The one in flight, the other stretch'd in death,
6150	Their spirits within them quail'd; but Pallas took
6150	The hand of Mars, and thus address'd the God:
6150	"""Mars, Mars, thou bane of mortals, blood-stain'd Lord,"
6150	Razer of cities, wherefore leave we not
6150	The Greeks and Trojans to contend, and see
6150	To which the sire of all will vict'ry give;
6150	"While we retire, and shun the wrath of Jove?"""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, from the battle Mars she led,
6150	And plac'd him on Scamander's steepy banks.

6150	The Greeks drove back the Trojan host; the chiefs
6150	Slew each his victim; Agamemnon first,

6150	Hodius, the sturdy Halizonian chief,
6150	Him, as he turn'd, between the shoulder-blades
6150	The jav'lin struck, and through his chest was driv'n;

6150	On Phaestus, Borus' son, Maeonian chief,

6150	Through his right shoulder drove the pointed spear;

6150	"""Arouse ye, valiant Trojans, ye who goad"
6150	Your flying steeds; the bravest of the Greeks
6150	Is wounded, nor, I deem, can long withstand
6150	My weapon, if indeed from Lycia's shore
6150	"By Phoebus' counsel sent I join'd the war."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he, vain-glorious; but not so was quell'd
6150	The godlike chief; back he withdrew, and stood
6150	Beside his car, and thus to Sthenelus,
6150	The son of Capaneus, his speech address'd:
6150	"""Up, gentle son of Capaneus, descend"
6150	From off the car, and from my shoulder draw
6150	"This stinging arrow forth."" He said, and down"
6150	Leap'd from the chariot Sthenelus, and stood
6150	Beside him; and as forth he drew the shaft,
6150	Gush'd out the blood, and dyed the twisted mail.
6150	Then thus the valiant son of Tydeus pray'd:
6150	"""Hear me, thou child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
6150	Unconquer'd! if amid the deadly fight
6150	Thy friendly aid my father e'er sustain'd,
6150	Let me in turn thy favour find; and grant
6150	Within my reach and compass of my spear
6150	That man may find himself, who unawares
6150	Hath wounded me, and vainly boasting deems
6150	"I shall not long behold the light of day."""
6150	Thus pray'd the chief, and Pallas heard his pray'r;
6150	To all his limbs, to feet and hands alike,
6150	She gave fresh vigour; and with winged words,
6150	Beside him as she stood, address'd him thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Go fearless onward, Diomed, to meet"
6150	The Trojan hosts; for I within thy breast
6150	Thy father's dauntless courage have infus'd,
6150	Such as of old in Tydeus' bosom dwelt,
6150	Bold horseman, buckler-clad; and from thine eyes
6150	The film that dimm'd them I have purg'd away,
6150	That thou mayst well 'twixt Gods and men discern.
6150	If then some God make trial of thy force,
6150	With other of th' Immortals fight thou not;
6150	But should Jove's daughter Venus dare the fray
6150	"Thou needst not shun at her to cast thy spear."""
6150	""
6150	This said, the blue-ey'd Goddess disappear'd.
6150	Forthwith again amid the foremost ranks
6150	Tydides mingled; keenly as before
6150	His spirit against the Trojans burn'd to fight,
6150	With threefold fury now he sought the fray.
6150	As when a hungry lion has o'erleap'd
6150	The sheepfold; him the guardian of the flock
6150	Has wounded, not disabled; by his wound
6150	To rage excited, but not forc'd to fly,
6150	The fold he enters, scares the trembling sheep,
6150	That, closely huddled, each on other press,
6150	Then pounces on his prey, and leaps the fence:
6150	So pounc'd Tydides on the Trojan host.
6150	Astynous and Hypeiron then he slew,
6150	His people's guardian; through the breast of one
6150	He drove his spear, and with his mighty sword
6150	He smote the other on the collar-bone,
6150	The shoulder sev'ring from the neck and back.
6150	Them left he there to lie; of Abas then
6150	And Polyeidus went in hot pursuit,
6150	Sons of Eurydamas, an aged seer,
6150	Whose visions stay'd them not; but both were doom'd
6150	A prey to valiant Diomed to fall.
6150	Xanthus and Thoon then the hero slew,
6150	The sons of Phaenops, children of his age:
6150	He, worn with years, no other sons begot,
6150	Heirs of his wealth; they two together fell,
6150	And to their father left a load of grief,
6150	That from the battle they return'd not home,
6150	And distant kindred all his substance shar'd.
6150	On Chromius and Echemon next he fell,
6150	Two sons of Priam on one chariot borne;
6150	And as a lion springs upon a herd,
6150	And breaks the neck of heifer or of steer,
6150	Feeding in woodland glade; with such a spring
6150	These two, in vain resisting, from their car
6150	Tydides hurl'd; then stripp'd their arms, and bade
6150	His followers lead their horses to the ships.
6150	""
6150	Him when AEneas saw amid the ranks
6150	Dealing destruction, through the fight and throng
6150	Of spears he plung'd, if haply he might find
6150	The godlike Pandarus; Lycaon's son
6150	He found, of noble birth and stalwart form,
6150	And stood before him, and address'd him thus:
6150	"""Where, Pandarus, are now thy winged shafts,"
6150	Thy bow, and well-known skill, wherein with thee
6150	Can no man here contend? nor Lycia boasts,
6150	Through all her wide-spread plains, a truer aim;
6150	Then raise to Jove thy hands, and with thy shaft
6150	Strike down this chief, whoe'er he be, that thus
6150	Is making fearful havoc in our host,
6150	Relaxing many a warrior's limbs in death:
6150	If he be not indeed a God, incens'd
6150	Against the Trojans for neglected rites;
6150	"For fearful is the vengeance of a God."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Lycaon's noble son:
6150	"""AEneas, chief and councillor of Troy,"
6150	Most like in all respects to Tydeus' son
6150	He seems; his shield I know, and visor'd helm,
6150	And horses; whether he himself be God,
6150	I cannot tell; but if he be indeed
6150	The man I think him, Tydeus' valiant son,
6150	He fights not thus without the aid of Heav'n;
6150	But by his side, his shoulders veiled in cloud,
6150	Some God attends his steps, and turns away
6150	The shaft that just hath reach'd him; for ev'n now
6150	A shaft I shot, which by the breastplate's joint
6150	Pierc'd his right shoulder through: full sure I deem'd
6150	That shaft had sent him to the shades, and yet
6150	It slew him not; 'tis sure some angry God.
6150	Nor horse have I, nor car on which to mount;
6150	But in my sire Lycaon's wealthy house
6150	Elev'n fair chariots stand, all newly built,
6150	Each with its cover; by the side of each
6150	Two steeds on rye and barley white are fed;
6150	And in his well-built house, when here I came,
6150	Lycaon, aged warrior, urg'd me oft
6150	With horses and with chariots high upborne,
6150	To lead the Trojans in the stubborn fight;
6150	I hearken'd not--'twere better if I had--
6150	Yet fear'd I lest my horses, wont to feed
6150	In plenty unstinted, by the soldiers' wants
6150	Might of their custom'd forage be depriv'd;
6150	I left them there, and hither came on foot,
6150	And trusting to my bow: vain trust, it seems;
6150	Two chiefs already have I struck, the sons
6150	Of Tydeus and of Atreus; with true aim
6150	Drawn blood from both, yet but increas'd their rage.
6150	Sad was the hour when down from where it hung
6150	I took my bow, and hasting to the aid
6150	Of godlike Hector, hither led my troops;
6150	But should I e'er return, and see again
6150	My native land, my wife, my lofty hall,
6150	Then may a stranger's sword cut off my head,
6150	If with these hands I shatter not, and burn,
6150	"The bow that thus hath fail'd me at my need."""
6150	""
6150	Him answer'd thus AEneas, chief of Troy:
6150	"""Speak thou not thus; our fortunes shall not change"
6150	Till thou and I, with chariot and with horse,
6150	This chief encounter, and his prowess prove;
6150	Then mount my car, and see how swift my steeds.
6150	Hither and thither, in pursuit or flight,
6150	From those of Tros descended, scour the plain.
6150	So if the victory to Diomed,
6150	The son of Tydeus, should by Jove be giv'n,
6150	We yet may safely reach the walls of Troy.
6150	Take thou the whip and reins, while I descend
6150	To fight on foot; or thou the chief engage,
6150	"And leave to me the conduct of the car."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Lycaon's noble son:
6150	"""AEneas, of thy horses and thy car"
6150	Take thou the charge; beneath th' accustomed hand,
6150	With more assurance would they draw the car,
6150	If we from Tydeus' son be forced to fly;
6150	Nor, struck with panic, and thy voice unheard,
6150	Refuse to bear us from the battle-field;
6150	So should ourselves be slain, and Tydeus' son
6150	In triumph drive thy horses to the ships.
6150	But thou thy horses and thy chariot guide,
6150	"While I his onset with my lance receive."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, on the car they mounted both,
6150	And tow'rd Tydides urg'd their eager steeds.
6150	Them Sthenelus beheld, the noble son
6150	Of Capaneus, and to Tydides cried:
6150	"""Oh son of Tydeus, dearest to my soul,"
6150	Two men I see, of might invincible,
6150	Impatient to engage thee; Pandarus,
6150	Well skill'd in archery, Lycaon's son;
6150	With him. AEneas, great Anchises' son,
6150	Who from immortal Venus boasts his birth.
6150	Then let us timely to the car retreat,
6150	Lest, moving thus amid the foremost ranks,
6150	"Thy daring pay the forfeit of thy life."""
6150	""
6150	To whom brave Diomed with stern regard:
6150	"""Talk not to me of flight! I heed thee not!"
6150	It is not in my nature so to fight
6150	With skulking artifice and faint retreat;
6150	My strength is yet unbroken; I should shame
6150	To mount the car; but forward will I go
6150	To meet these chiefs' encounter; for my soul
6150	Pallas forbids the touch of fear to know.
6150	Nor shall their horses' speed procure for both
6150	A safe return, though one escape my arm.
6150	This too I say, and bear my words in mind;
6150	By Pallas' counsel if my hap should be
6150	To slay them both, leave thou my horses here,
6150	The reins attaching to the chariot-rail,
6150	And seize, and from the Trojans to the ships
6150	Drive off the horses in AEneas' car;
6150	From those descended, which all-seeing Jove
6150	On Tros, for Ganymede his son, bestow'd:
6150	With these may none beneath the sun compare.
6150	Anchises, King of men, the breed obtain'd
6150	By cunning, to the horses sending mares
6150	Without the knowledge of Laomedon.
6150	Six colts were thus engender'd: four of these
6150	In his own stalls he rear'd; the other two
6150	Gave to AEneas, fear-inspiring chief:
6150	"These could we win, our praise were great indeed."""
6150	""
6150	Such converse while they held, the twain approach'd,
6150	Their horses urg'd to speed; then thus began,
6150	To Diomed, Lycaon's noble son:
6150	""
6150	"""Great son of Tydeus, warrior brave and skill'd,"
6150	My shaft, it seems, has fail'd to reach thy life;
6150	"Try we then now what hap attends my spear."""
6150	He said; and, poising, hurl'd his pond'rous spear,
6150	And struck Tydides' shield; right through the shield
6150	Drove the keen weapon, and the breastplate reach'd.
6150	Then shouted loud Lycaon's noble son:
6150	"""Thou hast it through the flank, nor canst thou long"
6150	"Survive the blow; great glory now is mine."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, unmov'd, the valiant Diomed:
6150	"""Thine aim hath failed, I am not touch'd; and now"
6150	I deem we part not hence till one of ye
6150	"Glut with his blood th' insatiate Lord of War."""
6150	""
6150	He said: the spear, by Pallas guided, struck
6150	Beside the nostril, underneath the eye;
6150	Crash'd thro' the teeth, and cutting thro' the tongue
6150	Beneath the angle of the jaw came forth:
6150	Down from the car he fell; and loudly rang
6150	His glitt'ring arms: aside the startled steeds
6150	Sprang devious: from his limbs the spirit fled.
6150	Down leap'd AEneas, spear and shield in hand,
6150	Against the Greeks to guard the valiant dead;
6150	And like a lion, fearless in his strength,
6150	Around the corpse he stalk'd, this way and that,
6150	His spear and buckler round before him held,
6150	To all who dar'd approach him threat'ning death,
6150	With fearful shouts; a rocky fragment then
6150	Tydides lifted up, a mighty mass,
6150	Which scarce two men could raise, as men are now:
6150	But he, unaided, lifted it with ease.
6150	With this he smote AEneas near the groin,
6150	Where the thigh-bone, inserted in the hip,
6150	Turns in the socket-joint; the rugged mass
6150	The socket crush'd, and both the tendons broke,
6150	And tore away the flesh: down on his knees,
6150	Yet resting on his hand, the hero fell;
6150	And o'er his eyes the shades of darkness spread.
6150	Then had AEneas, King of men, been slain,
6150	Had not his mother, Venus, child of Jove,
6150	Who to Anchises, where he fed his flocks,
6150	The hero bore, his peril quickly seen:
6150	Around her son she threw her snowy arms,
6150	And with a veil, thick-folded, wrapt him round,
6150	From hostile spears to guard him, lest some Greek
6150	Should pierce his breast, and rob him of his life.
6150	""
6150	She from the battle thus her son removed;
6150	Nor did the son of Capaneus neglect
6150	The strict injunction by Tydides giv'n;
6150	His reins attaching to the chariot-rail,
6150	Far from the battle-din he check'd, and left,
6150	His own fleet steeds; then rushing forward, seiz'd,
6150	And from the Trojans tow'rd the camp drove off,
6150	The sleek-skinn'd horses of AEneas' car.
6150	These to Deipylus, his chosen friend,
6150	He gave, of all his comrades best esteem'd,
6150	Of soundest judgment, tow'rd the ships to drive.
6150	Then, his own car remounting, seiz'd the reins,
6150	And urg'd with eager haste his fiery steeds,
6150	Seeking Tydides; he, meanwhile, press'd on
6150	In keen pursuit of Venus; her he knew
6150	A weak, unwarlike Goddess, not of those
6150	That like Bellona fierce, or Pallas, range
6150	Exulting through the blood-stain'd fields of war.
6150	""
6150	Her, searching thro' the crowd, at length he found,
6150	And springing forward, with his pointed spear
6150	A wound inflicted on her tender hand.
6150	Piercing th' ambrosial veil, the Graces' work,
6150	The sharp spear graz'd her palm below the wrist.
6150	Forth from the wound th' immortal current flow'd,
6150	Pure ichor, life-stream of the blessed Gods;
6150	They eat no bread, they drink no ruddy wine,
6150	And bloodless thence and deathless they become.
6150	The Goddess shriek'd aloud, and dropp'd her son;
6150	But in his arms Apollo bore him off
6150	In a thick cloud envelop'd, lest some Greek
6150	Might pierce his breast, and rob him of his life.
6150	Loud shouted brave Tydides, as she fled:
6150	"""Daughter of Jove, from battle-fields retire;"
6150	Enough for thee weak woman to delude;
6150	If war thou seek'st, the lesson thou shalt learn
6150	"Shall cause thee shudder but to hear it nam'd."""
6150	Thus he; but ill at ease, and sorely pain'd,
6150	The Goddess fled: her, Iris, swift as wind,
6150	Caught up, and from the tumult bore away,
6150	Weeping with pain, her fair skin soil'd with blood.
6150	""
6150	Mars on the left hand of the battle-field
6150	She found, his spear reclining by his side,
6150	And, veil'd in cloud, his car and flying steeds.
6150	Kneeling, her brother she besought to lend
6150	The flying steeds, with golden frontlets crown'd:
6150	"""Dear brother, aid me hence, and lend thy car"
6150	To bear me to Olympus, seat of Gods;
6150	Great is the pain I suffer from a wound
6150	Receiv'd from Diomed, a mortal man,
6150	"Who now would dare with Jove himself to fight."""
6150	""
6150	He lent the steeds, with golden frontlets crown'd;
6150	In deep distress she mounted on the car:
6150	Beside her Iris stood, and took the reins,
6150	And urg'd the coursers; nothing loth they flew,
6150	And soon to high Olympus, seat of Gods,
6150	They came: swift Iris there the coursers stay'd,
6150	Loos'd from the chariot, and before them plac'd
6150	Ambrosial forage: on her mother's lap,
6150	Dione, Venus fell; she in her arms
6150	Embrac'd, and sooth'd her with her hand, and said:
6150	"""Which of the heav'nly pow'rs hath wrong'd thee thus,"
6150	"My child, as guilty of some open shame?"""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the laughter-loving Queen;
6150	"""The haughty son of Tydeus, Diomed,"
6150	Hath wounded me, because my dearest son,
6150	AEneas, from the field I bore away.
6150	No more 'twixt Greeks and Trojans is the fight,
6150	"But with the Gods themselves the Greeks contend."""
6150	To whom Dione, heav'nly Goddess, thus:
6150	"""Have patience, dearest child; though much enforc'd,"
6150	Restrain thine anger: we, in Heav'n who dwell,
6150	Have much to bear from mortals; and ourselves
6150	Too oft upon each other suff'rings lay.
6150	Mars had his suff'rings; by Aloeus' sons,
6150	Otus and Ephialtes, strongly bound,
6150	He thirteen months in brazen fetters lay:
6150	And there had pin'd away the God of War,
6150	Insatiate Mars, had not their step-mother,
6150	The beauteous Eriboea, sought the aid
6150	Of Hermes; he by stealth releas'd the God,
6150	Sore worn and wasted by his galling chains.
6150	Juno too suffer'd, when Amphitryon's son
6150	Through her right breast a three-barb'd arrow sent:
6150	Dire, and unheard of, were the pangs she bore.
6150	Great Pluto's self the stinging arrow felt,
6150	When that same son of aegis-bearing Jove
6150	Assail'd him in the very gates of hell,
6150	And wrought him keenest anguish; pierc'd with pain
6150	To high Olympus, to the courts of Jove,
6150	Groaning, he came; the bitter shaft remain'd
6150	Deep in his shoulder fix'd, and griev'd his soul.
6150	But soon with soothing ointments Paeon's hand
6150	(For death on him was powerless) heal'd the wound.
6150	Accurs'd was he, of daring over-bold,
6150	Reckless of evil deeds, who with his bow
6150	Assail'd the Gods, who on Olympus dwell.
6150	The blue-ey'd Pallas, well I know, has urg'd
6150	Tydides to assail thee; fool and blind!
6150	Unknowing he how short his term of life
6150	Who fights against the Gods! for him no child
6150	Upon his knees shall lisp a father's name,
6150	Safe from the war and battle-field return'd.
6150	Brave as he is, let Diomed beware
6150	He meet not some more dangerous foe than thee.
6150	Then fair AEgiale, Adrastus' child,
6150	The noble wife of valiant Diomed,
6150	Shall long, with lamentations loud, disturb
6150	The slumbers of her house, and vainly mourn
6150	"Her youthful Lord, the bravest of the Greeks."""
6150	""
6150	She said; and wip'd the ichor from, the wound;
6150	he hand was heal'd, the grievous pains allay'd.
6150	But Juno and Minerva, looking on,
6150	With words of bitter mock'ry Saturn's son
6150	Provok'd: and thus the blue-ey'd Goddess spoke:
6150	"""O Father! may I speak without offence?"
6150	Venus, it seems, has sought to lead astray
6150	Some Grecian woman, and persuade to join
6150	Those Trojans, whom she holds in high esteem;
6150	And, as her hand the gentle dame caress'd,
6150	"A golden clasp has scratched her slender arm."""
6150	""
6150	Thus she: and smil'd the Sire of Gods and men;
6150	He call'd the golden Venus to his side,
6150	"And, ""Not to thee, my child,"" he said, ""belong"
6150	The deeds of war; do thou bestow thy care
6150	On deeds of love, and tender marriage ties;
6150	"But leave to Mars and Pallas feats of arms."""
6150	""
6150	Such converse while they held, brave Diomed
6150	Again assail'd AEneas; well he knew
6150	Apollo's guardian hand around him thrown;
6150	Yet by the God undaunted, on he press'd
6150	To slay AEneas, and his arms obtain.
6150	Thrice was his onset made, with murd'rous aim;
6150	And thrice Apollo struck his glitt'ring shield;
6150	But when, with godlike force, he sought to make
6150	His fourth attempt, the Far-destroyer spoke
6150	"In terms of awful menace: ""Be advis'd,"
6150	Tydides, and retire; nor as a God
6150	Esteem thyself; since not alike the race
6150	"Of Gods immortal and of earth-born men."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and Diomed a little space
6150	Before the Far-destroyer's wrath retir'd:
6150	Apollo then AEneas bore away
6150	Far from the tumult; and in Pergamus,
6150	Where stood his sacred shrine, bestow'd him safe.
6150	Latona there, and Dian, Archer-Queen,
6150	In the great temple's innermost recess,
6150	Gave to his wounds their care, and sooth'd his pride.
6150	Meanwhile Apollo of the silver bow
6150	A phantom form prepar'd, the counterpart
6150	Of great AEneas, and alike in arms:
6150	Around the form, of Trojans and of Greeks,
6150	Loud was the din of battle; fierce the strokes
6150	That fell on rounded shield of tough bull's-hide,
6150	And lighter targe, before each warrior's breast.
6150	Then thus Apollo to the God of War:
6150	"""Mars! Mars! thou bane of mortals, blood-stain'd Lord,"
6150	Razer of cities, wer't not well thyself
6150	To interpose, and from the battle-field
6150	Withdraw this chief, Tydides? such his pride,
6150	He now would dare with Jove himself to fight.
6150	Venus, of late, he wounded in the wrist;
6150	"And, like a God, but now confronted me."""
6150	He said, and sat on Ilium's topmost height:
6150	While Mars, in likeness of the Thracian chief,
6150	Swift Acamas, amid the Trojan ranks
6150	Mov'd to and fro, and urg'd them to the fight.
6150	To Priam's Heav'n-descended sons he call'd;
6150	"""Ye sons of Priam, Heav'n-descended King,"
6150	How long will ye behold your people slain?
6150	Till to your very doors the war be brought?
6150	AEneas, noble-soul'd Anchises' son,
6150	In like esteem with Hector held, is down;
6150	"On to his aid! our gallant comrade save!"""
6150	""
6150	He said; his words fresh courage gave to all:
6150	Then thus Sarpedon, in reproachful tone,
6150	"Address'd the godlike Hector; ""Where is now,"
6150	Hector, the spirit that heretofore was thine?
6150	'Twas once thy boast that ev'n without allies
6150	Thyself, thy brethren, and thy house, alone
6150	The city could defend: for all of these
6150	I look in vain, and see not one; they all,
6150	As curs around a lion, cow'r and crouch:
6150	We, strangers and allies, maintain the fight.
6150	I to your aid, from lands afar remote,
6150	From Lycia came, by Xanthus' eddying stream;
6150	There left a cherish'd wife, and infant son,
6150	And rich possessions, which might envy move;
6150	Yet I my troops encourage; and myself
6150	Have play'd my part, though nought have I to lose,
6150	Nought that the Greeks could drive or bear away;
6150	But thou stand'st idly by; nor bidd'st the rest
6150	Maintain their ground, and guard their wives and homes.
6150	Beware lest ye, as in the meshes caught
6150	Of some wide-sweeping net, become the prey
6150	And booty of your foes, who soon shall lay
6150	Your prosp'rous city level with the dust.
6150	By day and night should this thy thoughts engage,
6150	With constant pray'r to all thy brave allies,
6150	"Firmly to stand, and wipe this shame away."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and Hector felt the biting speech;
6150	Down from his car he leap'd; and through the ranks,
6150	Two jav'lins brandishing, he pass'd, to arms
6150	Exciting all, and rais'd his battle-cry.
6150	The tide was turn'd; again they fac'd the Greeks:
6150	In serried ranks the Greeks, undaunted, stood.
6150	As when the wind from off a threshing-floor,
6150	Where men are winnowing, blows the chaff away;
6150	When yellow Ceres with the breeze divides
6150	The corn and chaff, which lies in whit'ning heaps;
6150	So thick the Greeks were whiten'd o'er with dust,
6150	Which to the brazen vault of Heav'n arose
6150	Beneath the horses' feet, that with the crowd
6150	Were mingled, by their drivers turn'd to flight.
6150	Unwearied still, they bore the brunt; but Mars
6150	The Trojans succouring, the battle-field
6150	Veil'd in thick clouds, from ev'ry quarter brought.
6150	Thus he of Phoebus of the golden sword
6150	Obey'd th' injunction, bidding him arouse
6150	The courage of the Trojans, when he saw
6150	Pallas approaching to support the Greeks.
6150	""
6150	Then from the wealthy shrine Apollo's self
6150	AEneas brought, and vigour fresh infus'd:
6150	Amid his comrades once again he stood;
6150	They joy'd to see him yet alive, and sound,
6150	And full of vigour; yet no question ask'd:
6150	No time for question then, amid the toils
6150	Impos'd by Phoebus of the silver bow,
6150	And blood-stain'd Mars, and Discord unappeas'd.
6150	""
6150	Meanwhile Ulysses, and th' Ajaces both,
6150	And Diomed, with courage for the fight
6150	The Grecian force inspir'd; they undismay'd
6150	Shrank not before the Trojans' rush and charge;
6150	In masses firm they stood, as when the clouds
6150	Are gather'd round the misty mountain top
6150	By Saturn's son, in breathless calm, while sleep
6150	The force of Boreas and the stormy winds,
6150	That with their breath the shadowy clouds disperse;
6150	So stood the Greeks, nor shunn'd the Trojans' charge.
6150	Through all the army Agamemnon pass'd,
6150	"And cried, ""Brave comrades, quit ye now like men;"
6150	Bear a stout heart; and in the stubborn fight,
6150	Let each to other mutual succour give;
6150	By mutual succour more are sav'd than fall;
6150	"In timid flight nor fame nor safety lies."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he: and straight his jav'lin threw, and struck
6150	A man of mark, AEneas' faithful friend,
6150	Deicoon, the son of Pergasus,
6150	By Troy, as ever foremost in the field,
6150	In equal honour held with Priam's sons.
6150	His shield the monarch Agamemnon struck;
6150	The shield's defence was vain; the spear pass'd through
6150	Beneath the belt, and in his groin was lodg'd;
6150	Thund'ring he fell, and loud his armour rang.
6150	""
6150	On th' other side, AEneas slew two chiefs,
6150	The bravest of the Greeks, Orsilochus
6150	And Crethon, sons of Diocles, who dwelt
6150	In thriving Phera; rich in substance he,
6150	And from the mighty River Alpheus trac'd
6150	His high descent, who through the Pylian land
6150	His copious waters pours; to him was born
6150	Orsilochus, of num'rous tribes the chief;
6150	To him succeeded valiant Diocles;
6150	To whom were born twin sons, Orsilochus
6150	And Crethon, skill'd in ev'ry point of war.
6150	They, in the vigour of their youth, to Troy
6150	Had sail'd amid the dark-ribb'd ships of Greece,
6150	Of Atreus' sons the quarrel to uphold;
6150	But o'er them both the shades of death were spread.
6150	As two young lions, by their tawny dam
6150	Nurs'd in the mountain forest's deep recess,
6150	On flocks and herds their youthful fury pour,
6150	With havoc to the sheepfolds, till themselves
6150	Succumb, o'ermaster'd by the hand of man:
6150	So fell these two beneath AEneas' hand,
6150	And like two lofty pines in death they lay.
6150	""
6150	The warlike Menelaus saw their fall
6150	With pitying eye; and through the foremost ranks
6150	With brandish'd spear advanc'd, by Mars impell'd,
6150	Who hop'd his death by great AEneas' hand.
6150	Him Nestor's son, Antilochus, beheld,
6150	And hasten'd to his aid; for much he fear'd
6150	Lest ill befall the monarch, and his death
6150	Deprive them of their warlike labours' fruit.
6150	They two, with force combined of hand and spear,
6150	Press'd onward to the fight; Antilochus
6150	His station keeping close beside the King.
6150	Before the two combined, AEneas fear'd,
6150	Bold warrior as he was, to hold his ground.
6150	The slain they drew within the Grecian lines,
6150	Placed in their comrades' hands, and turning back
6150	Amid the foremost mingled in the fray.
6150	Then, brave as Mars, Pylaemenes they slew,
6150	The buckler'd Paphlagonians' warlike chief;
6150	Him Menelaus, hand to hand engag'd,
6150	Pierc'd with a spear-thrust through the collar-bone;
6150	While, with a pond'rous stone, Antilochus
6150	Full on the elbow smote Atymnius' son,
6150	Mydon, his charioteer, in act to turn
6150	His fiery steeds to flight; down from his hands
6150	Fell to the ground the iv'ry-mounted reins.
6150	On rush'd Antilochus, and with his sword
6150	Across the temples smote him; gasping, he
6150	Upon his neck and shoulders from the car
6150	Pitch'd headlong; and (for there the sand was deep)
6150	Awhile stood balanc'd, till the horses' feet
6150	Dash'd him upon the ground; Antilochus,
6150	The horses seizing, drove them to the ships.
6150	""
6150	Hector beheld athwart the ranks, and rush'd,
6150	Loud shouting, to th' encounter; at his back
6150	Follow'd the thronging bands of Troy, by Mars
6150	And fierce Bellona led; she by the hand
6150	Wild Uproar held; while Mars a giant spear
6150	Brandish'd aloft: and stalking now before,
6150	Now following after Hector, urg'd them on.
6150	Quail'd at the sight the valiant Diomed:
6150	As when a man, long journeying o'er the plain,
6150	All unprepar'd, stands sudden on the brink
6150	Of a swift stream, down rushing to the sea,
6150	Boiling with foam, and back recoils; so then
6150	Recoil'd Tydides, and address'd the crowd:
6150	"""O friends, we marvel at the might display'd"
6150	By Hector, spearman skill'd and warrior bold;
6150	But still some guardian God his steps attends,
6150	And shields from danger; now beside him stands,
6150	In likeness of a mortal, Mars himself.
6150	Then turning still your faces to your foes,
6150	"Retire, nor venture with the Gods to fight."""
6150	""
6150	He said; the Trojans now were close at hand,
6150	And, mounted both upon a single car,
6150	Two chiefs, Menesthes and Anchialus,
6150	Well skill'd in war, by Hector's hand were slain.
6150	""
6150	With pitying eyes great Ajax Telamon
6150	Beheld their fall; advancing close, he threw
6150	His glitt'ring spear; the son of Selagus
6150	It struck, Amphius, who in Paesus dwelt,
6150	In land and substance rich; by evil fate
6150	Impell'd, to Priam's house he brought his aid.
6150	Below the belt the spear of Ajax struck,
6150	And in his groin the point was buried deep;
6150	Thund'ring he fell; then forward Ajax sprang
6150	To seize the spoils of war; but fast and fierce
6150	The Trojans show'r'd their weapons bright and keen,
6150	And many a lance the mighty shield receiv'd.
6150	Ajax, his foot firm planted on the slain,
6150	Withdrew the brazen spear; yet could not strip
6150	His armour off, so galling flew the shafts;
6150	And much he fear'd his foes might hem him in,
6150	Who closely press'd upon him, many and brave;
6150	And, valiant as he was, and tall, and strong,
6150	Still drove him backward; he perforce retired.
6150	""
6150	Thus labour'd they amid the stubborn fight.
6150	Then evil fate induc'd Tlepolemus,
6150	Valiant and strong, the son of Hercules,
6150	Heav'n-born Sarpedon to confront in fight.
6150	When near they came, of cloud-compelling Jove
6150	Grandson and son, Tlepolemus began:
6150	"""Sarpedon, Lycian chief, what brings thee here,"
6150	Trembling and crouching, all unskill'd in war?
6150	Falsely they speak who fable thee the son
6150	Of aegis-bearing Jove; so far art thou
6150	Beneath their mark who claim'd in elder days
6150	That royal lineage: such my father was,
6150	Of courage resolute, of lion heart.
6150	With but six ships, and with a scanty band,
6150	The horses by Laomedon withheld
6150	Avenging, he o'erthrew this city, Troy,
6150	And made her streets a desert; but thy soul
6150	Is poor, thy troops are wasting fast away;
6150	Nor deem I that the Trojans will in thee
6150	(Ev'n were thy valour more) and Lycia's aid
6150	Their safeguard find; but vanquish'd by my hand,
6150	"This day the gates of Hades thou shalt pass."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Lycian chief, Sarpedon, thus:
6150	"""Tlepolemus, the sacred walls of Troy"
6150	Thy sire o'erthrew, by folly of one man,
6150	Laomedon, who with injurious words
6150	His noble service recompens'd; nor gave
6150	The promis'd steeds, for which he came from far.
6150	For thee, I deem thou now shalt meet thy doom
6150	Here, at my hand; on thee my spear shall win
6150	"Renown for me, thy soul to Hades send."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as Sarpedon spoke, Tlepolemus
6150	Uprais'd his ashen spear; from both their hands
6150	The pond'rous weapons simultaneous flew.
6150	Full in the throat Tlepolemus receiv'd
6150	Sarpedon's spear; right through the neck it pass'd,
6150	And o'er his eyes the shades of death were spread.
6150	On th' other side his spear Sarpedon struck
6150	On the left thigh; the eager weapon pass'd
6150	Right through the flesh, and in the bone was fix'd;
6150	The stroke of death his father turn'd aside.
6150	Sarpedon from the field his comrades bore,
6150	Weigh'd down and tortured by the trailing spear,
6150	For, in their haste to bear him to his car,
6150	Not one bethought him from his thigh to draw
6150	The weapon forth; so sorely were they press'd.
6150	""
6150	The Greeks too from the battle-field convey'd
6150	The slain Tlepolemus; Ulysses saw,
6150	Patient of spirit, but deeply mov'd at heart;
6150	And with conflicting thoughts his breast was torn,
6150	If first he should pursue the Thund'rer's son,
6150	Or deal destruction on the Lycian host.
6150	But fate had not decreed the valiant son
6150	Of Jove to fall beneath Ulysses' hand;
6150	So on the Lycians Pallas turn'd his wrath.
6150	Alastor then, and Coeranus he slew,
6150	Chromius, Alcander, Halius, Prytanis,
6150	Noemon; nor had ended then the list
6150	Of Lycian warriors by Ulysses slain;
6150	But Hector of the glancing helm beheld;
6150	Through the front ranks he rush'd, with burnish'd crest
6150	Resplendent, flashing terror on the Greeks;
6150	With joy Sarpedon saw his near approach,
6150	And with imploring tones address'd him thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, thou son of Priam, leave me not"
6150	A victim to the Greeks, but lend thine aid:
6150	Then in your city let me end my days.
6150	For not to me is giv'n again to see
6150	My native land; or, safe returning home,
6150	"To glad my sorrowing wife and infant child."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; but Hector, answ'ring not a word,
6150	Pass'd on in silence, hasting to pursue
6150	The Greeks, and pour destruction on their host.
6150	""
6150	Beneath the oak of aegis-bearing Jove
6150	His faithful comrades laid Sarpedon down,
6150	And from his thigh the valiant Pelagon,
6150	His lov'd companion, drew the ashen spear.
6150	He swoon'd, and giddy mists o'erspread his eyes:
6150	But soon reviv'd, as on his forehead blew,
6150	While yet he gasp'd for breath, the cooling breeze.
6150	""
6150	By Mars and Hector of the brazen helm
6150	The Greeks hard-press'd, yet fled not to their ships,
6150	Nor yet sustain'd the fight; but back retir'd
6150	Soon as they learned the presence of the God.
6150	Say then who first, who last, the prowess felt
6150	Of Hector, Priam's son, and mail-clad Mars?
6150	The godlike Teuthras first, Orestes next,
6150	Bold charioteer; th' AEtolian spearman skill'd,
6150	Trechus, OEnomaus, and Helenus,
6150	The son of OEnops; and Oresbius, girt
6150	With sparkling girdle; he in Hyla dwelt,
6150	The careful Lord of boundless wealth, beside
6150	Cephisus' marshy banks; Boeotia's chiefs
6150	Around him dwelt, on fat and fertile soil.
6150	Juno, the white-arm'd Queen, who saw these two
6150	The Greeks destroying in the stubborn fight,
6150	To Pallas thus her winged words address'd:
6150	"""O Heav'n! brave child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
6150	Vain was our word to Menelaus giv'n.
6150	That he the well-built walls of Troy should raze,
6150	And safe return, if unrestrain'd we leave
6150	Ferocious Mars to urge his mad career.
6150	"Come then; let us too mingle in the fray."""
6150	""
6150	She said: and Pallas, blue-ey'd Maid, complied.
6150	Offspring of Saturn, Juno, heav'nly Queen,
6150	Herself th' immortal steeds caparison'd,
6150	Adorn'd with golden frontlets: to the car
6150	Hebe the circling wheels of brass attach'd,
6150	Eight-spok'd, that on an iron axle turn'd;
6150	The felloes were of gold, and fitted round
6150	With brazen tires, a marvel to behold;
6150	The naves were silver, rounded every way:
6150	The chariot-board on gold and silver bands
6150	Was hung, and round it ran a double rail:
6150	The pole was all of silver; at the end
6150	A golden yoke, with golden yoke-bands fair:
6150	And Juno, all on fire to join the fray,
6150	Beneath the yoke the flying coursers led.
6150	""
6150	Pallas, the child of aegis-bearing Jove,
6150	Within her father's threshold dropp'd her veil,
6150	Of airy texture, work of her own hands;
6150	The cuirass donn'd of cloud-compelling Jove,
6150	And stood accoutred for the bloody fray.
6150	Her tassell'd aegis round her shoulders next
6150	She threw, with Terror circled all around;
6150	And on its face were figur'd deeds of arms,
6150	And Strife, and Courage high, and panic Rout;
6150	There too a Gorgon's head, of monstrous size,
6150	Frown'd terrible, portent of angry Jove:
6150	And on her head a golden helm she plac'd,
6150	Four-crested, double-peak'd, whose ample verge
6150	A hundred cities' champions might suffice:
6150	Her fiery car she mounted: in her hand
6150	A spear she bore, long, weighty, tough; wherewith
6150	The mighty daughter of a mighty sire
6150	Sweeps down the ranks of those her hate pursues.
6150	""
6150	Then Juno sharply touch'd the flying steeds:
6150	Forthwith spontaneous opening, grated harsh
6150	The heavenly portals, guarded by the Hours,
6150	Who Heav'n and high Olympus have in charge
6150	To roll aside, or draw the veil of cloud.
6150	Through these th' excited horses held their way.
6150	They found the son of Saturn, from the Gods
6150	Sitting apart, upon the highest crest
6150	Of many-ridg'd Olympus; there arriv'd,
6150	The white-arm'd Goddess Juno stay'd her steeds,
6150	And thus address'd the Sov'reign Lord of Heav'n:
6150	""
6150	"""O Father Jove! canst thou behold unmov'd"
6150	The violence of Mars? how many Greeks,
6150	Reckless and uncontroll'd, he hath destroy'd;
6150	To me a source of bitter grief; meanwhile
6150	Venus and Phoebus of the silver bow
6150	Look on, well pleas'd, who sent this madman forth,
6150	To whom both law and justice are unknown.
6150	Say, Father Jove, shall I thine anger move,
6150	"If with disgrace I drive him from the field?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
6150	"""Go, send against him Pallas; she, I know,"
6150	"Hath oft inflicted on him grievous pain.""."
6150	""
6150	He said: the white-arm'd Queen with joy obey'd;
6150	She urg'd her horses; nothing loth, they flew
6150	Midway between the earth, and starry Heav'n:
6150	Far as his sight extends, who from on high
6150	Looks from his watch-tow'r o'er the dark-blue sea,
6150	So far at once the neighing horses bound.
6150	But when to Troy they came, beside the streams
6150	Where Simois' and Scamander's waters meet,
6150	The white-arm'd Goddess stay'd her flying steeds,
6150	Loos'd from the car, and veil'd in densest cloud.
6150	For them, at bidding of the river-God,
6150	Ambrosial forage grew: the Goddesses,
6150	Swift as the wild wood-pigeon's rapid flight,
6150	Sped to the battle-field to aid the Greeks.
6150	But when they reach'd the thickest of the fray,
6150	Where throng'd around the might of Diomed
6150	The bravest and the best, as lions fierce,
6150	Or forest-boars, the mightiest of their kind,
6150	There stood the white-arm'd Queen, and call'd aloud,
6150	In form of Stentor, of the brazen voice,
6150	Whose shout was as the shout of fifty men:
6150	""
6150	"""Shame on ye, Greeks, base cowards! brave alone"
6150	In outward semblance; while Achilles yet
6150	Went forth to battle, from the Dardan gates
6150	The Trojans never ventur'd to advance,
6150	So dreaded they his pond'rous spear; but now
6150	"Far from the walls, beside your ships, they fight."""
6150	""
6150	She said: her words their drooping courage rous'd.
6150	Meanwhile the blue-ey'd Pallas went in haste
6150	In search of Tydeus' son; beside his car
6150	She found the King, in act to cool the wound
6150	Inflicted by the shaft of Pandarus:
6150	Beneath his shield's broad belt the clogging sweat
6150	Oppress'd him, and his arm was faint with toil;
6150	The belt was lifted up, and from the wound
6150	He wip'd the clotted blood: beside the car
6150	The Goddess stood, and touch'd the yoke, and said:
6150	""
6150	"""Little like Tydeus' self is Tydeus' son:"
6150	Low was his stature, but his spirit was high:
6150	And ev'n when I from combat rashly wag'd
6150	Would fain have kept him back, what time in Thebes
6150	He found himself, an envoy and alone,
6150	Without support, among the Thebans all,
6150	I counsell'd him in peace to share the feast:
6150	But by his own impetuous courage led,
6150	He challenged all the Thebans to contend
6150	With him in wrestling, and o'erthrew them all
6150	With ease; so mighty was the aid I gave.
6150	Thee now I stand beside, and guard from harm,
6150	And bid thee boldly with the Trojans fight.
6150	But, if the labours of the battle-field
6150	O'ertask thy limbs, or heartless fear restrain,
6150	"No issue thou of valiant Tydeus' loins."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the valiant Diomed:
6150	"""I know thee, Goddess, who thou art; the child"
6150	Of aegis-bearing Jove: to thee my mind
6150	I freely speak, nor aught will I conceal.
6150	Nor heartless fear, nor hesitating doubt,
6150	Restrain me; but I bear thy words in mind,
6150	With other of th' Immortals not to fight:
6150	But should Jove's daughter, Venus, dare the fray,
6150	At her I need not shun to throw my spear.
6150	Therefore I thus withdrew, and others too
6150	Exhorted to retire, since Mars himself
6150	"I saw careering o'er the battle-field."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the blue-ey'd Goddess, Pallas, thus:
6150	"""Thou son of Tydeus, dearest to my soul,"
6150	Fear now no more with Mars himself to fight,
6150	Nor other God; such aid will I bestow.
6150	Come then; at him the first direct thy car;
6150	Encounter with him hand to hand; nor fear
6150	To strike this madman, this incarnate curse,
6150	This shameless renegade; who late agreed
6150	With Juno and with me to combat Troy,
6150	And aid the Grecian cause; who now appears,
6150	"The Greeks deserting, in the Trojan ranks."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Pallas spoke, and stretching forth her hand
6150	Backward his comrade Sthenelus she drew
6150	From off the chariot; down in haste he sprang.
6150	His place beside the valiant Diomed
6150	The eager Goddess took; beneath the weight
6150	Loud groan'd the oaken axle; for the car
6150	A mighty Goddess and a Hero bore.
6150	Then Pallas took the whip and reins, and urg'd
6150	Direct at Mars the fiery coursers' speed.
6150	""
6150	The bravest of th' AEtolians, Periphas,
6150	Ochesius' stalwart son, he just had slain,
6150	And stood in act to strip him of his arms.
6150	The helmet then of Darkness Pallas donn'd,
6150	To hide her presence from the sight of Mars:
6150	But when the blood-stain'd God of War beheld
6150	Advancing tow'rd him godlike Diomed,
6150	The corpse of stalwart Periphas he left,
6150	There where he fell, to lie; while he himself
6150	Of valiant Diomed th' encounter met.
6150	When near they came, first Mars his pond'rous spear
6150	Advane'd beyond the yoke and horses' reins,
6150	With murd'rous aim; but Pallas from the car
6150	Turn'd it aside, and foil'd the vain attempt.
6150	""
6150	Then Diomed thrust forward in his turn
6150	His pond'rous spear; low on the flank of Mars,
6150	Guided by Pallas, with successful aim,
6150	Just where the belt was girt, the weapon struck:
6150	It pierc'd the flesh, and straight was back withdrawn:
6150	Then Mars cried out aloud, with such a shout
6150	As if nine thousand or ten thousand men
6150	Should simultaneous raise their battle-cry:
6150	Trojans and Greeks alike in terror heard,
6150	Trembling; so fearful was the cry of Mars.
6150	As black with clouds appears the darken'd air,
6150	When after heat the blust'ring winds arise,
6150	So Mars to valiant Diomed appear'd,
6150	As in thick clouds lie took his heav'nward flight.
6150	With speed he came to great Olympus' heights,
6150	Th' abode of Gods; and sitting by the throne
6150	Of Saturn's son, with anguish torn, he show'd
6150	Th' immortal stream that trickled from the wound,
6150	And thus to Jove his piteous words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""O Father Jove, canst thou behold unmov'd"
6150	These acts of violence? the greatest ills
6150	We Gods endure, we each to other owe
6150	Who still in human quarrels interpose.
6150	Of thee we all complain; thy senseless child
6150	Is ever on some evil deed intent.
6150	The other Gods, who on Olympus dwell,
6150	Are all to thee obedient and submiss;
6150	But thy pernicious daughter, nor by word
6150	Nor deed dost thou restrain; who now excites
6150	Th' o'erbearing son of Tydeus, Diomed,
6150	Upon th' immortal Gods to vent his rage.
6150	Venus of late he wounded in the wrist,
6150	And, as a God, but now encounter'd me:
6150	Barely I 'scap'd by swiftness of my feet;
6150	Else, 'mid a ghastly heap of corpses slain,
6150	In anguish had I lain; and, if alive,
6150	"Yet liv'd disabl'd by his weapon's stroke."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the Cloud-compeller, Jove,
6150	"With look indignant: ""Come no more to me,"
6150	Thou wav'ring turncoat, with thy whining pray'rs:
6150	Of all the Gods who on Olympus dwell
6150	I hate thee most; for thou delight'st in nought
6150	But strife and war; thou hast inherited
6150	Thy mother, Juno's, proud, unbending mood,
6150	Whom I can scarce control; and thou, methinks,
6150	To her suggestions ow'st thy present plight.
6150	Yet since thou art my offspring, and to me
6150	Thy mother bore thee, I must not permit
6150	That thou should'st long be doom'd to suffer pain;
6150	But had thy birth been other than it is,
6150	For thy misdoings thou hadst long ere now
6150	"Been banish'd from the Gods' companionship."""
6150	""
6150	He said: and straight to Paeon gave command
6150	To heal the wound; with soothing anodynes
6150	He heal'd it quickly; soon as liquid milk
6150	Is curdled by the fig-tree's juice, and turns
6150	In whirling flakes, so soon was heal'd the wound.
6150	By Hebe bath'd, and rob'd afresh, he sat
6150	In health and strength restor'd, by Saturn's son.
6150	""
6150	Mars thus arrested in his murd'rous course,
6150	Together to th' abode of Jove return'd
6150	The Queen of Argos and the blue-ey'd Maid.

6150	THE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED, AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the
6150	chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to
6150	appoint a solemn procession of the Queen and the Trojan matrons to the
6150	temple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The
6150	battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have
6150	an interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge of
6150	the friendship and hospitality past between their ancestors, they make
6150	exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of Helenus,
6150	prevailed upon Paris to return to the battle, and taken a tender leave
6150	of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.

6150	BOOK VI.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	The Gods had left the field, and o'er the plain
6150	Hither and thither surg'd the tide of war,
6150	As couch'd th' opposing chiefs their brass-tipp'd spears,
6150	Midway 'twixt Simois' and Scamander's streams.
6150	""
6150	First through the Trojan phalanx broke his way
6150	The son of Telamon, the prop of Greece,
6150	The mighty Ajax; on his friends the light
6150	Of triumph shedding, as Eusorus' son
6150	He smote, the noblest of the Thracian bands,
6150	Valiant and strong, the gallant Acamas.
6150	Full in the front, beneath the plumed helm,
6150	The sharp spear struck, and crashing thro' the bone,
6150	The warrior's eyes were clos'd in endless night.
6150	""
6150	Next valiant Diomed Axylus slew,
6150	The son of Teuthranes, who had his home
6150	In fair Arisba; rich in substance he,
6150	And lov'd of all; for, dwelling near the road,
6150	He op'd to all his hospitable gate;
6150	But none of all he entertain'd was there
6150	To ward aside the bitter doom of death:
6150	There fell they both, he and his charioteer,
6150	Calesius, who athwart the battle-field
6150	His chariot drove; one fate o'ertook them both.
6150	""
6150	Then Dresus and Opheltius of their arms
6150	Euryalus despoil'd; his hot pursuit
6150	AEsepus next, and Pedasus assail'd,
6150	Brothers, whom Abarbarea, Naiad nymph,
6150	To bold Bucolion bore; Bucolion, son
6150	Of great Laomedon, his eldest born,
6150	Though bastard: he upon the mountain side,
6150	On which his flocks he tended, met the nymph,
6150	And of their secret loves twin sons were born;
6150	Whom now at once Euryalus of strength
6150	And life depriv'd, and of their armour stripp'd.
6150	""
6150	By Polypoetes' hand, in battle strong,
6150	Was slain Astyalus; Pidutes fell,
6150	Chief of Percote, by Ulysses' spear;
6150	And Teucer godlike Aretaon slew.
6150	Antilochus, the son of Nestor, smote
6150	With gleaming lance Ablerus; Elatus
6150	By Agamemnon, King of men, was slain,
6150	Who dwelt by Satnois' widely-flowing stream,
6150	Upon the lofty heights of Pedasus.
6150	By Leitus was Phylacus in flight
6150	O'erta'en; Eurypylus Melanthius slew.
6150	""
6150	Then Menelaus, good in battle, took
6150	Adrastus captive; for his horses, scar'd
6150	And rushing wildly o'er the plain, amid
6150	The tangled tamarisk scrub his chariot broke,
6150	Snapping the pole; they with the flying crowd
6150	Held city-ward their course; he from the car
6150	Hurl'd headlong, prostrate lay beside the wheel,
6150	Prone on his face in dust; and at his side,
6150	Poising his mighty spear, Atrides stood.
6150	Adrastus clasp'd his knees, and suppliant cried,
6150	"""Spare me, great son of Atreus! for my life"
6150	Accept a price; my wealthy father's house
6150	A goodly store contains of brass, and gold,
6150	And well-wrought iron; and of these he fain
6150	Would pay a noble ransom, could he hear
6150	"That in the Grecian ships I yet surviv'd."""
6150	""
6150	His words to pity mov'd the victor's breast;
6150	Then had he bade his followers to the ships
6150	The captive bear; but running up in haste.
6150	Fierce Agamemnon cried in stern rebuke;
6150	""
6150	"""Soft-hearted Menelaus, why of life"
6150	So tender? Hath thy house receiv'd indeed
6150	Nothing but benefits at Trojan hands?
6150	Of that abhorred race, let not a man
6150	Escape the deadly vengeance of our arms;
6150	No, not the infant in its mother's womb;
6150	No, nor the fugitive; but be they all,
6150	They and their city, utterly destroy'd,
6150	"Uncar'd for, and from mem'ry blotted out."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, his counsel, fraught with death,
6150	His brother's purpose chang'd; he with his hand
6150	Adrastus thrust aside, whom with his lance
6150	Fierce Agamemnon through the loins transfix'd;
6150	And, as he roll'd in death, upon his breast
6150	Planting his foot, the ashen spear withdrew.
6150	""
6150	Then loudly Nestor shouted to the Greeks:
6150	"""Friends, Grecian heroes, ministers of Mars!"
6150	Loiter not now behind, to throw yourselves
6150	Upon the prey, and bear it to the ships;
6150	Let all your aim be now to kill; anon
6150	"Ye may at leisure spoil your slaughter'd foes."""
6150	""
6150	With words like these he fir'd the blood of all.
6150	Now had the Trojans by the warlike Greeks
6150	In coward flight within their walls been driv'n;
6150	But to AEneas and to Hector thus
6150	The son of Priam, Helenus, the best
6150	Of all the Trojan seers, address'd his speech:
6150	"""AEneas, and thou Hector, since on you,"
6150	Of all the Trojans and the Lycian hosts,
6150	Is laid the heaviest burthen, for that ye
6150	Excel alike in council and in fight,
6150	Stand here awhile, and moving to and fro
6150	On ev'ry side, around the gates exhort
6150	The troops to rally, lest they fall disgrac'd,
6150	Flying for safety to their women's arms,
6150	And foes, exulting, triumph in their shame.
6150	Their courage thus restor'd, worn as we are,
6150	We with the Greeks will still maintain the fight,
6150	For so, perforce, we must; but, Hector, thou
6150	Haste to the city; there our mother find,
6150	Both thine and mine; on Ilium's topmost height
6150	By all the aged dames accompanied,
6150	Bid her the shrine of blue-ey'd Pallas seek;
6150	Unlock the sacred gates; and on the knees
6150	Of fair-hair'd Pallas place the fairest robe
6150	In all the house, the amplest, best esteem'd;
6150	And at her altar vow to sacrifice
6150	Twelve yearling kine that never felt the goad,
6150	So she have pity on the Trojan state,
6150	Our wives, and helpless babes, and turn away
6150	The fiery son of Tydeus, spearman fierce,
6150	The Minister of Terror; bravest he,
6150	In my esteem, of all the Grecian chiefs:
6150	For not Achilles' self, the prince of men,
6150	Though Goddess-born, such dread inspir'd; so fierce
6150	"His rage; and with his prowess none may vie."""
6150	""
6150	He said, nor uncomplying, Hector heard
6150	His brother's counsel; from his car he leap'd
6150	In arms upon the plain; and brandish'd high
6150	His jav'lins keen, and moving to and fro
6150	The troops encourag'd, and restor'd the fight.
6150	Rallying they turn'd, and fac'd again the Greeks:
6150	These ceas'd from slaughter, and in turn gave way,
6150	Deeming that from the starry Heav'n some God
6150	Had to the rescue come; so fierce they turn'd.
6150	Then to the Trojans Hector call'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Ye valiant Trojans, and renown'd Allies,"
6150	Quit you like men; remember now, brave friends,
6150	Your wonted valour; I to Ilium go
6150	To bid our wives and rev'rend Elders raise
6150	"To Heav'n their pray'rs, with vows of hecatombs."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, Hector of the glancing helm
6150	Turn'd to depart; and as he mov'd along,
6150	The black bull's-hide his neck and ancles smote,
6150	The outer circle of his bossy shield.
6150	""
6150	Then Tydeus' son, and Glaucus, in the midst,
6150	Son of Hippolochus, stood forth to fight;
6150	But when they near were met, to Glaucus first
6150	The valiant Diomed his speech address'd:
6150	"""Who art thou, boldest man of mortal birth?"
6150	For in the glorious conflict heretofore
6150	I ne'er have seen thee; but in daring now
6150	Thou far surpassest all, who hast not fear'd
6150	To face my spear; of most unhappy sires
6150	The children they, who my encounter meet.
6150	But if from Heav'n thou com'st, and art indeed
6150	A God, I fight not with the heav'nly powers.
6150	Not long did Dryas' son, Lycurgus brave,
6150	Survive, who dar'd th' Immortals to defy:
6150	He, 'mid their frantic orgies, in the groves
6150	Of lovely Nyssa, put to shameful rout
6150	The youthful Bacchus' nurses; they, in fear,
6150	Dropp'd each her thyrsus, scatter'd by the hand
6150	Of fierce Lycurgus, with an ox-goad arm'd.
6150	Bacchus himself beneath the ocean wave
6150	In terror plung'd, and, trembling, refuge found
6150	In Thetis' bosom from a mortal's threats:
6150	The Gods indignant saw, and Saturn's son
6150	Smote him with blindness; nor surviv'd he long,
6150	Hated alike by all th' immortal Gods.
6150	I dare not then the blessed Gods oppose;
6150	But be thou mortal, and the fruits of earth
6150	"Thy food, approach, and quickly meet thy doom."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the noble Glaucus thus replied:
6150	"""Great son of Tydeus, why my race enquire?"
6150	The race of man is as the race of leaves:
6150	Of leaves, one generation by the wind
6150	Is scattered on the earth; another soon
6150	In spring's luxuriant verdure bursts to light.
6150	So with our race; these flourish, those decay.
6150	But if thou wouldst in truth enquire and learn
6150	The race I spring from, not unknown of men;
6150	There is a city, in the deep recess
6150	Of pastoral Argos, Ephyre by name:
6150	There Sisyphus of old his dwelling had,
6150	Of mortal men the craftiest; Sisyphus,
6150	The son of AEolus; to him was born
6150	Glaucus; and Glaucus in his turn begot
6150	Bellerophon, on whom the Gods bestow'd
6150	The gifts of beauty and of manly grace.
6150	But Proetus sought his death; and, mightier far,
6150	From all the coasts of Argos drove him forth,
6150	To Proetus subjected by Jove's decree.
6150	For him the monarch's wife, Antaea, nurs'd
6150	A madd'ning passion, and to guilty love
6150	Would fain have tempted him; but fail'd to move
6150	The upright soul of chaste Bellerophon.
6150	With lying words she then address'd the King:
6150	'Die, Proetus, thou, or slay Bellerophon,
6150	Who basely sought my honour to assail.'
6150	The King with anger listen'd to her words;
6150	Slay him he would not; that his soul abhorr'd;
6150	But to the father of his wife, the King
6150	Of Lycia, sent him forth, with tokens charg'd
6150	Of dire import, on folded tablets trac'd,
6150	Pois'ning the monarch's mind, to work his death.
6150	To Lycia, guarded by the Gods, he went;
6150	But when he came to Lycia, and the streams
6150	Of Xanthus, there with hospitable rites
6150	The King of wide-spread Lycia welcom'd him.
6150	Nine days he feasted him, nine oxen slew;
6150	But with the tenth return of rosy morn
6150	He question'd him, and for the tokens ask'd
6150	He from his son-in-law, from Proetus, bore.
6150	The tokens' fatal import understood,
6150	He bade him first the dread Chimaera slay;
6150	A monster, sent from Heav'n, not human born,
6150	With head of lion, and a serpent's tail,
6150	And body of a goat; and from her mouth
6150	There issued flames of fiercely-burning fire:
6150	Yet her, confiding in the Gods, he slew.
6150	Next, with the valiant Solymi he fought,
6150	The fiercest fight that e'er he undertook.
6150	Thirdly, the women-warriors he o'erthrew,
6150	The Amazons; from whom returning home,
6150	The King another stratagem devis'd;
6150	For, choosing out the best of Lycia's sons,
6150	He set an ambush; they return'd not home,
6150	For all by brave Bellerophon were slain.
6150	But, by his valour when the King perceiv'd
6150	His heav'nly birth, he entertain'd him well;
6150	Gave him his daughter; and with her the half
6150	Of all his royal honours he bestow'd:
6150	A portion too the Lycians meted out,
6150	Fertile in corn and wine, of all the state
6150	The choicest land, to be his heritage.
6150	Three children there to brave Bellerophon
6150	Were born; Isander, and Hippolochus,
6150	Laodamia last, belov'd of Jove,
6150	The Lord of counsel; and to him she bore
6150	Godlike Sarpedon of the brazen helm.
6150	Bellerophon at length the wrath incurr'd
6150	Of all the Gods; and to th' Aleian plain
6150	Alone he wander'd; there he wore away
6150	His soul, and shunn'd the busy haunts of men.
6150	Insatiate Mars his son Isander slew
6150	In battle with the valiant Solymi:
6150	His daughter perish'd by Diana's wrath.
6150	I from Hippolochus my birth derive:
6150	To Troy he sent me, and enjoin'd me oft
6150	To aim at highest honours, and surpass
6150	My comrades all; nor on my father's name
6150	Discredit bring, who held the foremost place
6150	In Ephyre, and Lycia's wide domain.
6150	"Such is my race, and such the blood I boast."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and Diomed rejoicing heard:
6150	His spear he planted in the fruitful ground,
6150	And thus with friendly words the chief address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""By ancient ties of friendship are we bound;"
6150	For godlike OEneus in his house receiv'd
6150	For twenty days the brave Bellerophon;
6150	They many a gift of friendship interchang'd;
6150	A belt, with crimson glowing, OEneus gave;
6150	Bellerophon a double cup of gold,
6150	Which in my house I left when here I came.
6150	Of Tydeus no remembrance I retain;
6150	For yet a child he left me, when he fell
6150	With his Achaians at the gate of Thebes.
6150	So I in Argos am thy friendly host;
6150	Thou mine in Lycia, when I thither come:
6150	Then shun we, e'en amid the thickest fight,
6150	Each other's lance; enough there are for me
6150	Of Trojans and their brave allies to kill,
6150	As Heav'n may aid me, and my speed of foot;
6150	And Greeks enough there are for thee to slay,
6150	If so indeed thou canst; but let us now
6150	Our armour interchange, that these may know
6150	"What friendly bonds of old our houses join."""
6150	Thus as they spoke, they quitted each his car;
6150	Clasp'd hand in hand, and plighted mutual faith.
6150	Then Glaucus of his judgment Jove depriv'd,
6150	His armour interchanging, gold for brass,
6150	A hundred oxen's worth for that of nine.
6150	""
6150	Meanwhile, when Hector reach'd the oak beside
6150	The Scaean gate, around him throng'd the wives
6150	Of Troy, and daughters, anxious to enquire
6150	The fate of children, brothers, husbands, friends;
6150	He to the Gods exhorted all to pray,
6150	For deep the sorrows that o'er many hung.
6150	But when to Priam's splendid house he came,
6150	With polish'd corridors adorn'd--within
6150	Were fifty chambers, all of polish'd stone,
6150	Plac'd each by other; there the fifty sons
6150	Of Priam with their wedded wives repos'd;
6150	On th' other side, within the court were built
6150	Twelve chambers, near the roof, of polish'd stone,
6150	Plac'd each by other; there the sons-in-law
6150	Of Priam with their spouses chaste repos'd;
6150	To meet him there his tender mother came,
6150	And with her led the young Laodice,
6150	Fairest of all her daughters; clasping then
6150	"His hands, she thus address'd him: ""Why, my son,"
6150	Why com'st thou here, and leav'st the battle-field?
6150	Are Trojans by those hateful sons of Greece,
6150	Fighting around the city, sorely press'd?
6150	And com'st thou, by thy spirit mov'd, to raise,
6150	On Ilium's heights, thy hands in pray'r to Jove?
6150	But tarry till I bring the luscious wine,
6150	That first to Jove, and to th' Immortals all,
6150	Thou mayst thine off'ring pour; then with the draught
6150	Thyself thou mayst refresh; for great the strength
6150	Which gen'rous wine imparts to men who toil,
6150	"As thou hast toil'd, thy comrades to protect."""
6150	""
6150	To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
6150	"""No, not for me, mine honour'd mother, pour"
6150	The luscious wine, lest thou unnerve my limbs,
6150	And make me all my wonted prowess lose.
6150	The ruddy wine I dare not pour to Jove
6150	With hands unwash'd; nor to the cloud-girt son
6150	Of Saturn may the voice of pray'r ascend
6150	From one with blood bespatter'd and defil'd.
6150	Thou, with the elder women, seek the shrine
6150	Of Pallas; bring your gifts; and on the knees
6150	Of fair-hair'd Pallas place the fairest robe
6150	In all the house, the amplest, best esteem'd;
6150	And at her altar vow to sacrifice
6150	Twelve yearling kine, that never felt the goad;
6150	So she have pity on the Trojan state,
6150	Our wives, and helpless babes; and turn away
6150	The fiery son of Tydeus, spearman fierce,
6150	The Minister of Terror; to the shrine
6150	Of Pallas thou; to Paris I, to call
6150	If haply he will hear; would that the earth
6150	Would gape and swallow him! for great the curse
6150	That Jove thro' him hath brought on men of Troy,
6150	On noble Priam, and on Priam's sons.
6150	Could I but know that he were in his grave,
6150	"Methinks my sorrows I could half forget."""
6150	""
6150	He said: she, to the house returning, sent
6150	Th' attendants through the city, to collect
6150	The train of aged suppliants; she meanwhile
6150	Her fragrant chamber sought, wherein were stor'd
6150	Rich garments by Sidonian women work'd,
6150	Whom godlike Paris had from Sidon brought,
6150	Sailing the broad sea o'er, the selfsame path
6150	By which the high-born Helen he convey'd.
6150	Of these, the richest in embroidery,
6150	The amplest, and the brightest, as a star
6150	Refulgent, plac'd with care beneath the rest,
6150	The Queen her off'ring bore to Pallas' shrine:
6150	She went, and with her many an ancient dame.
6150	But when the shrine they reach'd on Ilium's height,
6150	Theano, fair of face, the gates unlock'd,
6150	Daughter of Cisseus, sage Antenor's wife,
6150	By Trojans nam'd at Pallas' shrine to serve.
6150	They with deep moans to Pallas rais'd their hands;
6150	But fair Theano took the robe, and plac'd
6150	On Pallas' knees, and to the heav'nly Maid,
6150	Daughter of Jove, she thus address'd her pray'r:
6150	"""Guardian of cities, Pallas, awful Queen,"
6150	Goddess of Goddesses, break thou the spear
6150	Of Tydeus' son; and grant that he himself
6150	Prostrate before the Scaean gates may fall;
6150	So at thine altar will we sacrifice
6150	Twelve yearling kine, that never felt the goad,
6150	If thou have pity on the state of Troy,
6150	"The wives of Trojans, and their helpless babes."""
6150	""
6150	Thus she; but Pallas answer'd not her pray'r.
6150	While thus they call'd upon the heav'nly Maid,
6150	Hector to Paris' mansion bent his way;
6150	A noble structure, which himself had built
6150	Aided by all the best artificers
6150	Who in the fertile realm of Troy were known;
6150	With chambers, hall, and court, on Ilium's height,
6150	Near to where Priam's self and Hector dwelt.
6150	There enter'd Hector, well belov'd of Jove;
6150	And in his hand his pond'rous spear he bore,
6150	Twelve cubits long; bright flash'd the weapon's point
6150	Of polish'd brass, with circling hoop of gold.
6150	There in his chamber found he whom he sought,
6150	About his armour busied, polishing
6150	His shield, his breastplate, and his bended bow.
6150	While Argive Helen, 'mid her maidens plac'd,
6150	The skilful labours of their hands o'erlook'd.
6150	To him thus Hector with reproachful words;
6150	"""Thou dost not well thine anger to indulge;"
6150	In battle round the city's lofty wall
6150	The people fast are falling; thou the cause
6150	That fiercely thus around the city burns
6150	The flame of war and battle; and thyself
6150	Wouldst others blame, who from the fight should shrink.
6150	"Up, ere the town be wrapp'd in hostile fires."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer godlike Paris thus:
6150	"""Hector, I own not causeless thy rebuke;"
6150	Yet will I speak; hear thou and understand;
6150	'Twas less from anger with the Trojan host,
6150	And fierce resentment, that I here remain'd,
6150	Than that I sought my sorrow to indulge;
6150	Yet hath my wife, e'en now, with soothing words
6150	Urg'd me to join the battle; so, I own,
6150	'Twere best; and Vict'ry changes oft her side.
6150	Then stay, while I my armour don; or thou
6150	"Go first: I, following, will o'ertake thee soon."""
6150	""
6150	He said: but Hector of the glancing helm
6150	Made answer none; then thus with gentle tones
6150	"Helen accosted him: ""Dear brother mine,"
6150	(Of me, degraded, sorrow-bringing, vile!)
6150	Oh that the day my mother gave me birth
6150	Some storm had on the mountains cast me forth!
6150	Or that the many-dashing ocean's waves
6150	Had swept me off, ere all this woe were wrought!
6150	Yet if these evils were of Heav'n ordain'd,
6150	Would that a better man had call'd me wife;
6150	A sounder judge of honour and disgrace:
6150	For he, thou know'st, no firmness hath of mind,
6150	Nor ever will; a want he well may rue.
6150	But come thou in, and rest thee here awhile,
6150	Dear brother, on this couch; for travail sore
6150	Encompasseth thy soul, by me impos'd,
6150	Degraded as I am, and Paris' guilt;
6150	On whom this burthen Heav'n hath laid, that shame
6150	"On both our names through years to come shall rest."""
6150	""
6150	To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
6150	"""Though kind thy wish, yet, Helen, ask me not"
6150	To sit or rest; I cannot yield to thee:
6150	For to the succour of our friends I haste,
6150	Who feel my loss, and sorely need my aid.
6150	But thou thy husband rouse, and let him speed,
6150	That he may find me still within the walls.
6150	For I too homeward go; to see once more
6150	My household, and my wife, and infant child:
6150	For whether I may e'er again return,
6150	I know not, or if Heav'n have so decreed,
6150	"That I this day by Grecian hands should fall."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, Hector of the glancing helm
6150	Turn'd to depart; with rapid step he reach'd
6150	His own well-furnished house, but found not there
6150	His white-arm'd spouse, the fair Andromache.
6150	She with her infant child and maid the while
6150	Was standing, bath'd in tears, in bitter grief,
6150	On Ilium's topmost tower: but when her Lord
6150	Found not within the house his peerless wife,
6150	Upon the threshold pausing, thus he spoke:
6150	"""Tell me, my maidens, tell me true, which way"
6150	Your mistress went, the fair Andromache;
6150	Or to my sisters, or my brothers' wives?
6150	Or to the temple where the fair-hair'd dames
6150	"Of Troy invoke Minerva's awful name?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom the matron of his house replied:
6150	"""Hector, if truly we must answer thee,"
6150	Not to thy sisters, nor thy brothers' wives,
6150	Nor to the temple where the fair-hair'd dames
6150	Of Troy invoke Minerva's awful name,
6150	But to the height of Ilium's topmost tow'r
6150	Andromache is gone; since tidings came
6150	The Trojan force was overmatch'd, and great
6150	The Grecian strength; whereat, like one distract,
6150	She hurried to the walls, and with her took,
6150	"Borne in the nurse's arms, her infant child."""
6150	""
6150	So spoke the ancient dame; and Hector straight
6150	Through the wide streets his rapid steps retrac'd.
6150	But when at last the mighty city's length
6150	Was travers'd, and the Scaean gates were reach'd,
6150	Whence was the outlet to the plain, in haste
6150	Running to meet him came his priceless wife,
6150	Eetion's daughter, fair Andromache;
6150	Eetion, who from Thebes Cilicia sway'd,
6150	Thebes, at the foot of Placos' wooded heights.
6150	His child to Hector of the brazen helm
6150	Was giv'n in marriage: she it was who now
6150	Met him, and by her side the nurse, who bore,
6150	Clasp'd to her breast, his all unconscious child,
6150	Hector's lov'd infant, fair as morning star;
6150	Whom Hector call'd Scamandrius, but the rest
6150	Astyanax, in honour of his sire,
6150	The matchless chief, the only prop of Troy.
6150	Silent he smil'd as on his boy he gaz'd:
6150	But at his side Andromache, in tears,
6150	Hung on his arm, and thus the chief address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Dear Lord, thy dauntless spirit will work thy doom:"
6150	Nor hast thou pity on this thy helpless child,
6150	Or me forlorn, to be thy widow soon:
6150	For thee will all the Greeks with force combin'd
6150	Assail and slay: for me, 'twere better far,
6150	Of thee bereft, to lie beneath the sod;
6150	Nor comfort shall be mine, if thou be lost,
6150	But endless grief; to me nor sire is left,
6150	Nor honour'd mother; fell Achilles' hand
6150	My sire Eetion slew, what time his arms
6150	The populous city of Cilicia raz'd,
6150	The lofty-gated Thebes; he slew indeed,
6150	But stripp'd him not; he reverenc'd the dead;
6150	And o'er his body, with his armour burnt,
6150	A mound erected; and the mountain nymphs,
6150	The progeny of aegis-bearing Jove,
6150	Planted around his tomb a grove of elms.
6150	There were sev'n brethren in my father's house;
6150	All in one day they fell, amid their herds
6150	And fleecy flocks, by fierce Achilles' hand.
6150	My mother, Queen of Placos' wooded height,
6150	Brought with the captives here, he soon releas'd
6150	For costly ransom; but by Dian's shafts
6150	She, in her father's house, was stricken down.
6150	But, Hector, thou to me art all in one,
6150	Sire, mother, brethren! thou, my wedded love!
6150	Then pitying us, within the tow'r remain,
6150	Nor make thy child an orphan, and thy wife
6150	A hapless widow; by the fig-tree here
6150	Array thy troops; for here the city wall,
6150	Easiest of access, most invites assault.
6150	Thrice have their boldest chiefs this point assail'd,
6150	The two Ajaces, brave Idomeneus,
6150	Th' Atridae both, and Tydeus' warlike son,
6150	Or by the prompting of some Heav'n-taught seer,
6150	"Or by their own advent'rous courage led."""
6150	""
6150	To whom great Hector of the glancing helm;
6150	"""Think not, dear wife, that by such thoughts as these"
6150	My heart has ne'er been wrung; but I should blush
6150	To face the men and long-rob'd dames of Troy,
6150	If, like a coward, I could shun the fight.
6150	Nor could my soul the lessons of my youth
6150	So far forget, whose boast it still has been
6150	In the fore-front of battle to be found,
6150	Charg'd with my father's glory and mine own.
6150	Yet in my inmost soul too well I know,
6150	The day must come when this our sacred Troy,
6150	And Priam's race, and Priam's royal self
6150	Shall in one common ruin be o'erthrown.
6150	But not the thoughts of Troy's impending fate,
6150	Nor Hecuba's nor royal Priam's woes,
6150	Nor loss of brethren, numerous and brave,
6150	By hostile hands laid prostrate in the dust,
6150	So deeply wring my heart as thoughts of thee,
6150	Thy days of freedom lost, and led away
6150	A weeping captive by some brass-clad Greek;
6150	Haply in Argos, at a mistress' beck,
6150	Condemn'd to ply the loom, or water draw
6150	From Hypereia's or Messeis' fount,
6150	Heart-wrung, by stern necessity constrain'd.
6150	Then they who see thy tears perchance may say,
6150	'Lo! this was Hector's wife, who, when they fought
6150	On plains of Troy, was Ilium's bravest chief.'
6150	Thus may they speak; and thus thy grief renew
6150	For loss of him, who might have been thy shield
6150	To rescue thee from slav'ry's bitter hour.
6150	Oh may I sleep in dust, ere be condemn'd
6150	"To hear thy cries, and see thee dragg'd away!"""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, great Hector stretch'd his arms
6150	To take his child; but back the infant shrank,
6150	Crying, and sought his nurse's shelt'ring breast,
6150	Scar'd by the brazen helm and horse-hair plume,
6150	That nodded, fearful, on the warrior's crest.
6150	Laugh'd the fond parents both, and from his brow
6150	Hector the casque remov'd, and set it down,
6150	All glitt'ring, on the ground; then kiss'd his child,
6150	And danc'd him in his arms; then thus to Jove
6150	And to th' Immortals all address'd his pray'r:
6150	"""Grant, Jove, and all ye Gods, that this my son"
6150	May be, as I, the foremost man of Troy,
6150	For valour fam'd, his country's guardian King;
6150	That men may say, 'This youth surpasses far
6150	His father,' when they see him from the fight,
6150	From slaughter'd foes, with bloody spoils of war
6150	"Returning, to rejoice his mother's heart!"""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, in his mother's arms he plac'd
6150	His child; she to her fragrant bosom clasp'd,
6150	Smiling through tears; with eyes of pitying love
6150	Hector beheld, and press'd her hand, and thus
6150	"Address'd her--""Dearest, wring not thus my heart!"
6150	For till my day of destiny is come,
6150	No man may take my life; and when it comes,
6150	Nor brave nor coward can escape that day.
6150	But go thou home, and ply thy household cares,
6150	The loom, and distaff, and appoint thy maids
6150	Their sev'ral tasks; and leave to men of Troy
6150	"And, chief of all to me, the toils of war."""
6150	""
6150	Great Hector said, and rais'd his plumed helm;
6150	And homeward, slow, with oft-reverted eyes,
6150	Shedding hot tears, his sorrowing wife return'd.
6150	Arriv'd at valiant Hector's well-built house,
6150	Her maidens press'd around her; and in all
6150	Arose at once the sympathetic grief.
6150	For Hector, yet alive, his household mourn'd,
6150	Deeming he never would again return,
6150	Safe from the fight, by Grecian hands unharm'd.
6150	""
6150	Nor linger'd Paris in his lofty halls;
6150	But donn'd his armour, glitt'ring o'er with brass,
6150	And through the city pass'd with bounding steps.
6150	As some proud steed, at well-fill'd manger fed,
6150	His halter broken, neighing, scours the plain,
6150	And revels in the widely-flowing stream
6150	To bathe his sides; then tossing high his head,
6150	While o'er his shoulders streams his ample mane.
6150	Light borne on active limbs, in conscious pride.
6150	To the wide pastures of the mares he flies;
6150	So Paris, Priam's son, from Ilium's height,
6150	His bright arms flashing like the gorgeous sun,
6150	Hasten'd, with boastful mien, and rapid step.
6150	Hector he found, as from the spot he turn'd
6150	Where with his wife he late had converse held;
6150	Whom thus the godlike Paris first address'd:
6150	"""Too long, good brother, art then here detain'd,"
6150	Impatient for the fight, by my delay;
6150	"Nor have I timely, as thou bad'st me, come."""
6150	To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm:
6150	"""My gallant brother, none who thinks aright"
6150	Can cavil at thy prowess in the field;
6150	For thou art very valiant; but thy will
6150	Is weak and sluggish; and it grieves my heart,
6150	When from the Trojans, who in thy behalf
6150	Such labours undergo, I hear thy name
6150	Coupled with foul reproach! But go we now!
6150	Henceforth shall all be well, if Jove permit
6150	That from our shores we drive th' invading Greeks,
6150	And to the ever-living Gods of Heav'n
6150	"In peaceful homes our free libations pour."""

6150	ARGUMENT.
6150	""
6150	THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector,
6150	Minerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her
6150	descend from Olympus, joins her near the Scaean gate. They agree to put
6150	off the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge
6150	the Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the
6150	challenge, the lot is cast, and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after
6150	several attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a
6150	council, Antenor proposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which
6150	Paris will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam
6150	sends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning
6150	the dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the
6150	funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor,
6150	erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with
6150	towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his
6150	jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both
6150	armies pass the night in feasting, but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans
6150	with thunder and other signs of his wrath.
6150	""
6150	The three-and-twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax; the
6150	next day the truce is agreed: another is taken up in the funeral rites
6150	of the slain; and one more in building the fortification before the
6150	ships; so that somewhat above three days is employed in this book. The
6150	scene lies wholly in the field.

6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, from out the city gates
6150	The noble Hector pass'd, and by his side
6150	His brother Paris; in the breast of both
6150	Burnt the fierce ardour of the battle-field.
6150	As when some God a fav'ring breeze bestows
6150	On seamen tugging at the well-worn oar,
6150	Faint with excess of toil, ev'n so appear'd
6150	Those brethren twain to Troy's o'erlabour'd host.
6150	""
6150	Then to their prowess fell, by Paris' hand
6150	Menesthius, royal Areithous' son,
6150	Whom to the King, in Arna, where he dwelt,
6150	The stag-ey'd dame Phylomedusa bore;
6150	While Hector smote, with well-directed spear,
6150	Beneath the brass-bound headpiece, through the throat,
6150	Eioneus, and slack'd his limbs in death;
6150	And Glaucus, leader of the Lycian bands,
6150	Son of Hippolochus, amid the fray
6150	Iphinous, son of Dexias, borne on high
6150	By two fleet mares upon a lofty car,
6150	Pierc'd through the shoulder; from the car he fell
6150	Prone to the earth, his limbs relax'd in death.
6150	But them when Pallas saw, amid the fray
6150	Dealing destruction on the hosts of Greece,
6150	From high Olympus to the walls of Troy
6150	She came in haste; Apollo there she found,
6150	As down he look'd from Ilium's topmost tow'r,
6150	Devising vict'ry to the arms of Troy.
6150	Beside the oak they met; Apollo first,
6150	The son of Jove, the colloquy began:
6150	"""Daughter of Jove, from great Olympus' heights,"
6150	Why com'st thou here, by angry passion led?
6150	Wouldst thou the vict'ry, swaying here and there,
6150	Give to the Greeks? since pitiless thou see'st
6150	The Trojans slaughter'd? Be advis'd by me,
6150	For so 'twere better; cause we for today
6150	The rage of battle and of war to cease;
6150	To-morrow morn shall see the fight renew'd,
6150	Until the close of Ilium's destiny;
6150	For so ye Goddesses have wrought your will,
6150	"That this fair city should in ruin fall."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the blue-ey'd Goddess thus replied:
6150	"""So be it, Archer-King; with like intent"
6150	I from Olympus came; but say, what means
6150	"Wilt thou devise to bid the conflict cease?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom Apollo, royal son of Jove:
6150	"""The might of valiant Hector let us move"
6150	To challenge to the combat, man to man,
6150	Some Grecian warrior; while the brass-clad Greeks
6150	Their champion urge the challenge to accept,
6150	"And godlike Hector meet in single fight."""
6150	""
6150	He said; nor did Minerva not assent;
6150	But Helenus, the son of Priam, knew
6150	The secret counsel by the Gods devis'd;
6150	And drawing near to Hector, thus he spoke:
6150	"""Hector, thou son of Priam, sage as Jove"
6150	In council, hearken to a brother's words.
6150	Bid that the Greeks and Trojans all sit down,
6150	And thou defy the boldest of the Greeks
6150	With thee in single combat to contend;
6150	By revelation from th' eternal Gods,
6150	"I know that here thou shalt not meet thy fate."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and Hector joy'd to hear his words;
6150	Forth in the midst he stepp'd, and with his spear
6150	Grasp'd in the middle, stay'd the Trojan ranks.
6150	With one accord they sat; on th' other side
6150	Atrides bade the well-greav'd Greeks sit down;
6150	While, in the likeness of two vultures, sat
6150	On the tall oak of aegis-bearing Jove,
6150	Pallas, and Phoebus of the silver bow,
6150	With heroes' deeds delighted; dense around
6150	Bristled the ranks, with shield, and helm, and spear.
6150	As when the west wind freshly blows, and brings
6150	A dark'ning ripple o'er the ocean waves,
6150	E'en so appear'd upon the plain the ranks
6150	Of Greeks and Trojans; standing in the midst,
6150	Thus to both armies noble Hector spoke:
6150	"""Hear, all ye Trojans, and ye well-greav'd Greeks,"
6150	The words I speak, the promptings of my soul.
6150	It hath not pleas'd high-thron'd Saturnian Jove
6150	To ratify our truce, who both afflicts
6150	With labours hard, till either ye shall take
6150	Our well-fenc'd city, or yourselves to us
6150	Succumb beside your ocean-going ships.
6150	Here have ye all the chiefest men of Greece;
6150	Of all, let him who dares with me to fight,
6150	Stand forth, and godlike Hector's might confront.
6150	And this I say, and call to witness Jove,
6150	If with the sharp-edg'd spear he vanquish me,
6150	He shall strip off, and to the hollow ships
6150	In triumph bear my armour; but my corpse
6150	Restore, that so the men and wives of Troy
6150	May deck with honours due my funeral pyre.
6150	But, by Apollo's grace should I prevail,
6150	I will his arms strip off and bear to Troy,
6150	And in Apollo's temple hang on high;
6150	But to the ships his corpse I will restore,
6150	That so the long-hair'd Greeks with solemn rites
6150	May bury him, and to his mem'ry raise
6150	By the broad Hellespont a lofty tomb;
6150	And men in days to come shall say, who urge
6150	Their full-oar'd bark across the dark-blue sea,
6150	'Lo there a warrior's tomb of days gone by,
6150	A mighty chief, whom glorious Hector slew:'
6150	"Thus shall they say, and thus my fame shall live."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Hector spoke; they all in silence heard,
6150	Sham'd to refuse, but fearful to accept.
6150	At length in anger Menelaus rose,
6150	Groaning in spirit, and with bitter words
6150	"Reproach'd them: ""Shame, ye braggart cowards, shame!"
6150	Women of Greece! I cannot call you men!
6150	'Twere foul disgrace indeed, and scorn on scorn,
6150	If Hector's challenge none of all the Greeks
6150	Should dare accept; to dust and water turn
6150	All ye who here inglorious, heartless sit!
6150	I will myself confront him; for success,
6150	"Th' immortal Gods above the issues hold."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, he donn'd his dazzling arms.
6150	Then, Menelaus, had thine end approach'd
6150	By Hector's hands, so much the stronger he,
6150	Had not the Kings withheld thee and restrain'd.
6150	Great Agamemnon's self, wide-ruling King,
6150	Seizing his hand, address'd him thus by name:
6150	"""What! Heav'n-born Menelaus, art thou mad?"
6150	Beseems thee not such folly; curb thy wrath,
6150	Though vex'd; nor think with Hector to contend,
6150	Thy better far, inspiring dread in all.
6150	From his encounter in the glorious fight,
6150	Superior far to thee, Achilles shrinks;
6150	But thou amid thy comrades' ranks retire;
6150	Some other champion will the Greeks provide;
6150	And, fearless as he is, and of the fight
6150	Insatiate, yet will Hector, should he 'scape
6150	Unwounded from the deadly battle-strife,
6150	"Be fain, methinks, to rest his weary limbs."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and with judicious counsel sway'd
6150	His brother's mind; he yielded to his words,
6150	And gladly his attendants doff'd his arms.
6150	""
6150	Then Nestor rose, and thus address'd the Greeks:
6150	"""Alas, alas! what shame is this for Greece!"
6150	What grief would fill the aged Peleus' soul,
6150	Sage chief in council, of the Myrmidons
6150	Leader approv'd, who often in his house
6150	Would question me, and lov'd from me to hear
6150	Of all the Greeks the race and pedigree,
6150	Could he but learn how Hector cow'd them all!
6150	He to the Gods with hands uprais'd would pray
6150	His soul might from his body be divorc'd,
6150	And sink beneath the earth! Oh would to Jove,
6150	To Pallas and Apollo, such were now
6150	My vig'rous youth, as when beside the banks
6150	Of swiftly-flowing Celadon, the men
6150	Of Pylos with th' Arcadian spearmen fought,
6150	By Pheia's walls, around Iardan's streams.
6150	Then from the ranks, in likeness as a God,
6150	Advanc'd their champion, Ereuthalion bold.
6150	The arms of Areithous he wore:
6150	Of godlike Areithous, whom men
6150	And richly-girdled women had surnam'd
6150	The Macebearer; for not with sword or bow
6150	He went to fight, but with an iron mace
6150	Broke through the squadrons: him Lycurgus slew,
6150	By stealth, not brav'ry, in a narrow way,
6150	Where nought avail'd his iron mace from death
6150	To save him; for Lycurgus, with his spear,
6150	Preventing, thrust him through the midst; he fell
6150	Prostrate; and from his breast the victor stripp'd
6150	His armour off, the gift of brass-clad Mars;
6150	And in the tug of war he wore it oft;
6150	But when Lycurgus felt th' approach of age,
6150	He to his faithful follower and friend,
6150	To Ereuthalion gave it; therewith, arm'd,
6150	He now to combat challeng'd all the chiefs.
6150	None dar'd accept, for fear had fallen on all;
6150	Then I with dauntless spirit his might oppos'd,
6150	The youngest of them all; with him I fought,
6150	And Pallas gave the vict'ry to my arm.
6150	Him there I slew, the tallest, strongest man;
6150	For many another there beside him lay.
6150	Would that my youth and strength were now the same;
6150	Then soon should Hector of the glancing helm
6150	A willing champion find; but ye, of Greece
6150	"The foremost men, with Hector fear to fight."""
6150	""
6150	The old man spoke reproachful; at his words
6150	Up rose nine warriors: far before the rest,
6150	The monarch Agamemnon, King of men;
6150	Next Tydeus' son, the valiant Diomed;
6150	The two Ajaces, cloth'd with courage high;
6150	Idomeneus, and of Idomeneus
6150	The faithful follower, brave Meriones,
6150	Equal in fight to blood-stain'd Mars; with these
6150	Eurypylus, Euaemon's noble son;
6150	Thoas, Andraemon's son; Ulysses last:
6150	These all with Hector offer'd to contend.
6150	Then thus again Gerenian Nestor spoke:
6150	"""Shake then the lots; on whomsoe'er it fall,"
6150	Great profit shall he bring to Grecian arms,
6150	Great glory to himself, if he escape
6150	"Unwounded from the deadly battle strife."""
6150	He said: each mark'd his sev'ral lot, and all
6150	Together threw in Agamemnon's helm.
6150	The crowd, with hands uplifted, pray'd the Gods,
6150	"And looking heav'nward, said, ""Grant, Father Jove,"
6150	The lot on Ajax, or on Tydeus' son,
6150	"Or on Mycenae's wealthy King may fall."""
6150	""
6150	Thus they: then aged Nestor shook the helm,
6150	And forth, according to their wish, was thrown
6150	The lot of Ajax; then from left to right
6150	A herald show'd to all the chiefs of Greece,
6150	In turn, the token; they who knew it not,
6150	Disclaim'd it all; but when to him he came
6150	Who mark'd, and threw it in Atrides' helm,
6150	The noble Ajax, and, approaching, placed
6150	The token in his outstretch'd hand, forthwith
6150	He knew it, and rejoic'd; before his feet
6150	He threw it down upon the ground, and said,
6150	"""O friends, the lot is mine; great is my joy,"
6150	And hope o'er godlike Hector to prevail.
6150	But now, while I my warlike armour don,
6150	Pray ye to Saturn's royal son, apart,
6150	In silence, that the Trojans hear ye not;
6150	Or ev'n aloud, for nought have we to fear.
6150	No man against my will can make me fly,
6150	By greater force or skill; nor will, I hope,
6150	My inexperience in the field disgrace
6150	"The teaching of my native Salamis."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; and they to Saturn's royal son
6150	Address'd their pray'rs, and looking heav'nward, said:
6150	"""O Father Jove, who rul'st on Ida's height!"
6150	Most great!  most glorious!  grant that Ajax now
6150	May gain the vict'ry, and immortal praise:
6150	Or if thy love and pity Hector claim,
6150	"Give equal pow'r and equal praise to both."""
6150	""
6150	Ajax meanwhile in dazzling brass was clad;
6150	And when his armour all was duly donn'd,
6150	Forward he mov'd, as when gigantic Mars
6150	Leads nations forth to war, whom Saturn's son
6150	In life-destroying conflict hath involv'd;
6150	So mov'd the giant Ajax, prop of Greece,
6150	With sternly smiling mien; with haughty stride
6150	He trod the plain, and pois'd his pond'rous spear.
6150	The Greeks, rejoicing, on their champion gaz'd,
6150	The Trojans' limbs beneath them shook with fear;
6150	Ev'n Hector's heart beat quicker in his breast;
6150	Yet quail he must not now, nor back retreat
6150	Amid his comrades--he, the challenger!
6150	Ajax approach'd; before him, as a tow'r
6150	His mighty shield he bore, sev'n-fold, brass-bound,
6150	The work of Tychius, best artificer
6150	That wrought in leather; he in Hyla dwelt.
6150	Of sev'n-fold hides the pond'rous shield was wrought
6150	Of lusty bulls; the eighth was glitt'ring brass.
6150	This by the son of Telamon was borne
6150	Before his breast; to Hector close he came,
6150	And thus with words of haughty menace spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, I now shall teach thee, man to man,"
6150	The mettle of the chiefs we yet possess,
6150	Although Achilles of the lion heart,
6150	Mighty in battle, be not with us still;
6150	He by his ocean-going ships indeed
6150	Against Atrides nurses still his wrath;
6150	Yet are there those who dare encounter thee,
6150	"And not a few; then now begin the fight."""
6150	""
6150	To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
6150	"""Ajax, brave leader, son of Telamon,"
6150	Deal not with me as with a feeble child,
6150	Or woman, ign'rant of the ways of war;
6150	Of war and carnage every point I know;
6150	And well I know to wield, now right, now left,
6150	The tough bull's-hide that forms my stubborn targe:
6150	Well know I too my fiery steeds to urge,
6150	And raise the war-cry in the standing fight.
6150	But not in secret ambush would I watch,
6150	To strike, by stealth, a noble foe like thee;
6150	"But slay thee, if I may, in open fight."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and, poising, hurl'd his pond'rous spear;
6150	The brazen cov'ring of the shield it struck,
6150	The outward fold, the eighth, above the sev'n
6150	Of tough bull's-hide; through six it drove its way
6150	With stubborn force; but in the seventh was stay'd,
6150	Then Ajax hurl'd in turn his pond'rous spear,
6150	And struck the circle true of Hector's shield;
6150	Right thro' the glitt'ring shield the stout spear pass'd,
6150	And thro' the well-wrought breastplate drove its way;
6150	And, underneath, the linen vest it tore;
6150	But Hector, stooping, shunn'd the stroke of death.
6150	Withdrawing then their weapons, each on each
6150	They fell, like lions fierce, or tusked boars,
6150	In strength the mightiest of the forest beasts.
6150	Then Hector fairly on the centre struck
6150	The stubborn shield; yet drove not through the spear;
6150	For the stout brass the blunted point repell'd.
6150	But Ajax, with a forward bound, the shield
6150	Of Hector pierc'd; right through the weapon pass'd;
6150	Arrested with rude shock the warrior's course,
6150	And graz'd his neck, that spouted forth the blood.
6150	Yet did not Hector of the glancing helm
6150	Flinch from the contest: stooping to the ground,
6150	With his broad hand a pond'rous stone he seiz'd,
6150	That lay upon the plain, dark, jagg'd, and huge,
6150	And hurl'd against the sev'n-fold shield, and struck
6150	Full on the central boss; loud rang the brass:
6150	Then Ajax rais'd a weightier mass of rock
6150	And sent it whirling, giving to his arm
6150	Unmeasur'd impulse; with a millstone's weight
6150	It crush'd the buckler; Hector's knees gave way;
6150	Backward he stagger'd, yet upon his shield
6150	Sustain'd, till Phoebus rais'd him to his feet.
6150	Now had they hand to hand with swords engag'd,
6150	Had not the messengers of Gods and men,
6150	The heralds, interpos'd; the one for Troy,
6150	The other umpire for the brass-clad Greeks,
6150	Talthybius and Idaeus, well approv'd.
6150	Between the chiefs they held their wands, and thus
6150	Idaeus both with prudent speech address'd:
6150	"""No more, brave youths! no longer wage the fight:"
6150	To cloud-compelling Jove ye both are dear,
6150	Both valiant spearmen; that, we all have seen.
6150	"Night is at hand; behoves us yield to night."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the son of Telamon:
6150	"""Idaeus, bid that Hector speak those words:"
6150	He challeng'd all our chiefs; let him begin:
6150	"If he be willing, I shall not refuse."""
6150	""
6150	To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
6150	"""Ajax, since God hath giv'n thee size, and strength,"
6150	And skill; and with the spear, of all the Greeks
6150	None is thine equal; cease we for to-day
6150	The fight; hereafter we may meet, and Heav'n
6150	Decide our cause, and one with vict'ry crown.
6150	Night is at hand; behoves us yield to night.
6150	So by the ships shalt thou rejoice the Greeks,
6150	And most of all, thy comrades and thy friends;
6150	And so shall I, in Priam's royal town,
6150	Rejoice the men of Troy, and long-rob'd dames,
6150	Who shall with grateful pray'rs the temples throng.
6150	But make we now an interchange of gifts,
6150	That both the Trojans and the Greeks may say,
6150	'On mortal quarrel did those warriors meet,
6150	"Yet parted thence in friendly bonds conjoin'd.'"""
6150	""
6150	This said, a silver-studded sword he gave,
6150	With scabbard and with well-cut belt complete;
6150	Ajax a girdle, rich with crimson dye.
6150	They parted; Ajax to the Grecian camp,
6150	And Hector to the ranks of Troy return'd:
6150	Great was the joy when him they saw approach,
6150	Alive and safe; escap'd from Ajax' might
6150	And arm invincible; and tow'rd the town
6150	They led him back, beyond their hope preserv'd;
6150	While to Atrides' tent the well-greav'd Greeks
6150	Led Ajax, glorying in his triumph gain'd.
6150	""
6150	But when to Agamemnon's tents they came,
6150	The King of men to Saturn's royal son
6150	A bullock slew, a male of five years old;
6150	The carcase then they flay'd; and cutting up,
6150	Sever'd the joints; then fixing on the spits,
6150	Roasted with care, and from the fire withdrew.
6150	Their labours ended, and the feast prepar'd,
6150	They shar'd the social meal, nor lack'd there aught.
6150	To Ajax then the chine's continuous length,
6150	As honour's meed, the mighty monarch gave.
6150	The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,
6150	The aged Nestor first his mind disclos'd;
6150	He who, before, the sagest counsel gave,
6150	Now thus with prudent speech began, and said:
6150	"""Atrides, and ye other chiefs of Greece,"
6150	Since many a long-hair'd Greek hath fall'n in fight,
6150	Whose blood, beside Scamander's flowing stream,
6150	Fierce Mars has shed, while to the viewless shades
6150	Their spirits are gone, behoves thee with the morn
6150	The warfare of the Greeks to intermit:
6150	Then we, with oxen and with mules, the dead
6150	From all the plain will draw; and, from the ships
6150	A little space remov'd, will burn with fire:
6150	That we, returning to our native land,
6150	May to their children bear our comrades' bones.
6150	Then will we go, and on the plain erect
6150	Around the pyre one common mound for all;
6150	Then quickly build before it lofty tow'rs
6150	To screen both ships and men; and in the tow'rs
6150	Make ample portals, with well-fitting gates,
6150	That through the midst a carriage-way may pass:
6150	And a deep trench around it dig, to guard
6150	Both men and chariots, lest on our defence
6150	"The haughty Trojans should too hardly press."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and all the Kings his words approv'd.
6150	Meanwhile, on Ilium's height, at Priam's gate
6150	The Trojan chiefs a troubled council held;
6150	Which op'ning, thus the sage Antenor spoke:
6150	"""Hear now, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies,"
6150	The words I speak, the promptings of my soul.
6150	Back to the sons of Atreus let us give
6150	The Argive Helen, and the goods she brought;
6150	For now in breach of plighted faith we fight:
6150	Nor can I hope, unless to my advice
6150	"Ye listen, that success will crown our arms."""
6150	Thus having said, he sat; and next arose
6150	The godlike Paris, fair-hair'd Helen's Lord;
6150	Who thus with winged words the chiefs address'd:
6150	"""Hostile to me, Antenor, is thy speech;"
6150	Thy better judgment better counsel knows;
6150	But if in earnest such is thine advice,
6150	Thee of thy senses have the Gods bereft.
6150	Now, Trojans, hear my answer; I reject
6150	The counsel, nor the woman will restore;
6150	But for the goods, whate'er I hither brought
6150	To Troy from Argos, I am well content
6150	"To give them all, and others add beside."""
6150	""
6150	This said, he sat; and aged Priam next,
6150	A God in council, Dardan's son, arose,
6150	Who thus with prudent speech began, and said:
6150	""
6150	"""Hear now, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies,"
6150	The words I speak, the promptings of my soul:
6150	Now through the city take your wonted meal;
6150	Look to your watch, let each man keep his guard:
6150	To-morrow shall Idaeus to the ships
6150	Of Greece, to both the sons of Atreus, bear
6150	The words of Paris, cause of all this war;
6150	And ask besides, if from the deadly strife
6150	Such truce they will accord us as may serve
6150	To burn the dead; hereafter we may fight
6150	"Till Heav'n decide, and one with vict'ry crown."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and they, obedient to his word,
6150	Throughout the ranks prepar'd the wonted meal:
6150	But with the morning to the ships of Greece
6150	Idaeus took his way: in council there
6150	By Agamemnon's leading ship he found
6150	The Grecian chiefs, the ministers of Mars:
6150	And 'mid them all the clear-voic'd herald spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Ye sons of Atreus, and ye chiefs of Greece,"
6150	From Priam, and the gallant sons of Troy,
6150	I come, to bear, if ye be pleas'd to hear,
6150	The words of Paris, cause of all this war:
6150	The goods which hither in his hollow ships
6150	(Would he had perish'd rather!) Paris brought,
6150	He will restore, and others add beside;
6150	But further says, the virgin-wedded wife
6150	Of Menelaus, though the gen'ral voice
6150	Of Troy should bid him. he will not restore:
6150	Then bids me ask, if from the deadly strife
6150	Such truce ye will accord us as may serve
6150	To burn the dead: hereafter we may fight
6150	"Till Heav'n decide, and one with vict'ry crown."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he: they all in silence heard; at length
6150	Uprose the valiant Diomed, and said;
6150	"""Let none from Paris now propose to accept"
6150	Or goods, or Helen's self; a child may see
6150	"That now the doom of Troy is close at hand."""
6150	He said; the sons of Greece, with loud applause,
6150	The speech of valiant Diomed confirm'd.
6150	""
6150	Then to Idaeus Agamemnon thus:
6150	"""Idaeus, thou hast heard what answer give"
6150	The chiefs of Greece--their answer I approve.
6150	But for the truce, for burial of the dead,
6150	I nought demur; no shame it is to grace
6150	With fun'ral rites the corpse of slaughter'd foes.
6150	"Be witness, Jove! and guard the plighted truce."""
6150	""
6150	He said: and heav'nward rais'd his staff; and back
6150	To Ilium's walls Idaeus took his way.
6150	Trojans and Dardans there in council met
6150	Expecting sat, till from the Grecian camp
6150	Idaeus should return; he came, and stood
6150	In mid assembly, and his message gave:
6150	Then all in haste their sev'ral ways dispers'd,
6150	For fuel some, and some to bring the dead.
6150	The Greeks too from their well-mann'd ships went forth,
6150	For fuel some, and some to bring the dead.
6150	The sun was newly glancing on the earth.
6150	From out the ocean's smoothly-flowing depths
6150	Climbing the Heav'ns, when on the plain they met.
6150	Hard was it then to recognize the dead;
6150	But when the gory dust was wash'd away,
6150	Shedding hot tears, they plac'd them on the wains.
6150	Nor loud lament, by Priam's high command,
6150	Was heard; in silence they, with grief suppress'd,
6150	Heap'd up their dead upon the fun'ral pyre;
6150	Then burnt with fire, and back return'd to Troy.
6150	The well-greav'd Greeks, they too, with grief suppress'd,
6150	Heap'd up their dead upon the fun'ral pyre;
6150	Then burnt with fire, and to the ships return'd.
6150	""
6150	But ere 'twas morn, while daylight strove with night,
6150	About the pyre a chosen band of Greeks
6150	Had kept their vigil, and around it rais'd
6150	Upon the plain one common mound for all;
6150	And built in front a wall, with lofty tow'rs
6150	To screen both ships and men; and in the tow'rs
6150	Made ample portals with well-fitting gates,
6150	That through the midst a carriage-way might pass:
6150	Then dug a trench around it, deep and wide,
6150	And in the trench a palisade they fix'd.
6150	""
6150	Thus labour'd thro' the night the long-hair'd Greeks:
6150	The Gods, assembled in the courts of Jove,
6150	With wonder view'd the mighty work; and thus
6150	Neptune, Earth-shaking King, his speech began:
6150	"""O Father Jove, in all the wide-spread earth"
6150	Shall men be found, in counsel and design
6150	To rival us Immortals? see'st thou not
6150	How round their ships the long-hair'd Greeks have built
6150	A lofty wall, and dug a trench around,
6150	Nor to the Gods have paid their off'rings due!
6150	Wide as the light extends shall be the fame
6150	Of this great work, and men shall lightly deem
6150	Of that which I and Phoebus jointly rais'd,
6150	"With toil and pain, for great Laomedon."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in wrath the Cloud-compeller thus:
6150	"""Neptune, Earth-shaking King, what words are these?"
6150	This bold design to others of the Gods,
6150	Of feebler hands, and pow'r less great than thine,
6150	Might cause alarm; but, far as light extends,
6150	Of this great work to thee shall be the fame:
6150	When with their ships the long-hair'd Greeks shall take
6150	Their homeward voyage to their native land,
6150	This wall shall by the waves be broken through,
6150	And sink, a shapeless ruin, in the sea:
6150	O'er the wide shore again thy sands shall spread,
6150	"And all the boasted work of Greece o'erwhelm."""
6150	""
6150	Amid themselves such converse held the Gods.
6150	The sun was set; the Grecian work was done;
6150	They slew, and shar'd, by tents, the ev'ning meal.
6150	From Lemnos' isle a num'rous fleet had come
6150	Freighted with wine; and by Euneus sent,
6150	Whom fair Hypsipyle to Jason bore.
6150	For Atreus' sons, apart from all the rest,
6150	Of wine, the son of Jason had despatch'd
6150	A thousand measures; all the other Greeks
6150	Hasten'd to purchase, some with brass, and some
6150	With gleaming iron; other some with hides,
6150	Cattle, or slaves; and joyous wax'd the feast.
6150	All night the long-hair'd Greeks their revels held,
6150	And so in Troy, the Trojans and Allies:
6150	But through the night his anger Jove express'd
6150	With awful thunderings; pale they turn'd with fear:
6150	To earth the wine was from the goblets shed,
6150	Nor dar'd they drink, until libations due
6150	Had first been pour'd to Saturn's mighty son.
6150	""
6150	Then lay they down, and sought the boon of sleep.

6150	""
6150	Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the
6150	pains of Tartarus, if they assist either side: Minerva only obtains of
6150	him that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels. The armies join
6150	battle; Jupiter on Mount Ida weighs in his balances the fates of both,
6150	and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings. Nestor alone
6150	continues in the field in great danger; Diomed relieves him; whose
6150	exploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described. Juno
6150	endeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in
6150	vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and
6150	carried off. Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are
6150	restrained by Iris, sent from Jupiter. The night puts an end to the
6150	battle. Hector continues in the field, (the Greeks being driven to
6150	their fortifications before the ships,) and gives orders to keep the
6150	watch all night in the camp, to prevent the enemy from re-embarking and
6150	escaping by flight. They kindle fires through all the field, and pass
6150	the night under arms.

6150	BOOK VIII.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Now morn, in saffron robe, the earth o'erspread;
6150	And Jove, the lightning's Lord, of all the Gods
6150	A council held upon the highest peak
6150	Of many-ridg'd Olympus; he himself
6150	Address'd them; they his speech attentive heard.
6150	""
6150	"""Hear, all ye Gods, and all ye Goddesses,"
6150	The words I speak, the promptings of my soul.
6150	Let none among you, male or female, dare
6150	To thwart my counsels: rather all concur,
6150	That so these matters I may soon conclude.
6150	If, from the rest apart, one God I find
6150	Presuming or to Trojans or to Greeks
6150	To give his aid, with ignominious stripes
6150	Back to Olympus shall that God be driv'n;
6150	Or to the gloom of Tartarus profound,
6150	Far off, the lowest abyss beneath the earth,
6150	With, gates of iron, and with floor of brass,
6150	Beneath the shades as far as earth from Heav'n,
6150	There will I hurl him, and ye all shall know
6150	In strength how greatly I surpass you all.
6150	Make trial if ye will, that all may know.
6150	A golden cord let down from Heav'n, and all,
6150	Both Gods and Goddesses, your strength, apply:
6150	Yet would ye fail to drag from Heav'n to earth,
6150	Strive as ye may, your mighty master, Jove;
6150	But if I choose to make my pow'r be known,
6150	The earth itself, and ocean, I could raise,
6150	And binding round Olympus' ridge the cord,
6150	Leave them suspended so in middle air:
6150	"So far supreme my pow'r o'er Gods and men."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and they, confounded by his words,
6150	In silence sat; so sternly did he speak.
6150	At length the blue-ey'd Goddess, Pallas, said:
6150	"""O Father, Son of Saturn, King of Kings,"
6150	Well do we know thy pow'r invincible;
6150	Yet deeply grieve we for the warlike Greeks,
6150	Condemn'd to hopeless ruin; from the fight,
6150	Since such is thy command, we stand aloof;
6150	But yet some saving counsel may we give,
6150	"Lest in thine anger thou destroy them quite."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cloud-compeller, smiling, thus:
6150	"""Be of good cheer, my child; unwillingly"
6150	"I speak, yet will not thwart thee of thy wish."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and straight the brazen-footed steeds,
6150	Of swiftest flight, with manes of flowing gold,
6150	He harness'd to his chariot; all in gold
6150	Himself array'd, the golden lash he grasp'd,
6150	Of curious work; and mounting on his car,
6150	Urg'd the fleet coursers; nothing loth, they flew
6150	Midway betwixt the earth and starry heav'n.
6150	To Ida's spring-abounding hill he came,
6150	And to the crest of Gargarus, wild nurse
6150	Of mountain beasts; a sacred plot was there,
6150	Whereon his incense-honour'd altar stood:
6150	There stay'd his steeds the Sire of Gods and men
6150	Loos'd from the car, and veil'd with clouds around.
6150	Then on the topmost ridge he sat, in pride
6150	Of conscious strength; and looking down, survey'd
6150	The Trojan city, and the ships of Greece.
6150	""
6150	Meantime, the Greeks throughout their tents in haste
6150	Despatch'd their meal, and arm'd them for the fight;
6150	On th' other side the Trojans donn'd their arms,
6150	In numbers fewer, but with stern resolve,
6150	By hard necessity constrain'd, to strive,
6150	For wives and children, in the stubborn fight.
6150	The gates all open'd wide, forth pour'd the crowd
6150	Of horse and foot; and loud the clamour rose.
6150	When in the midst they met, together rush'd
6150	Bucklers and lances, and the furious might
6150	Of mail-clad warriors; bossy shield on shield
6150	Clatter'd in conflict; loud the clamour rose:
6150	Then rose too mingled shouts and groans of men
6150	Slaying and slain; the earth ran red with blood.
6150	While yet 'twas morn, and wax'd the youthful day,
6150	Thick flew the shafts, and fast the people fell
6150	On either side; but when the sun had reach'd
6150	The middle Heav'n, th' Eternal Father hung
6150	His golden scales aloft, and plac'd in each
6150	The fatal death-lot: for the sons of Troy
6150	The one, the other for the brass-clad Greeks;
6150	Then held them by the midst; down sank the lot
6150	Of Greece, down to the ground, while high aloft
6150	Mounted the Trojan scale, and rose to Heav'n.                   [2]
6150	Then loud he bade the volleying thunder peal
6150	From Ida's heights; and 'mid the Grecian ranks
6150	He hurl'd his flashing lightning; at the sight
6150	Amaz'd they stood, and pale with terror shook.
6150	""
6150	Then not Idomeneus, nor Atreus' son,
6150	The mighty Agamemnon, kept their ground,
6150	Nor either Ajax, ministers of Mars;
6150	Gerenian Nestor, aged prop of Greece,
6150	Alone remain'd, and he against his will,
6150	His horse sore wounded by an arrow shot
6150	By godlike Paris, fair-hair'd Helen's Lord:
6150	Just on the crown, where close behind the head
6150	First springs the mane, the deadliest spot of all,
6150	The arrow struck him; madden'd with the pain
6150	He rear'd, then plunging forward, with the shaft
6150	Fix'd in his brain, and rolling in the dust,
6150	The other steeds in dire confusion threw;
6150	And while old Nestor with his sword essay'd
6150	To cut the reins, and free the struggling horse,
6150	Amid the rout down came the flying steeds
6150	Of Hector, guided by no timid hand,
6150	By Hector's self; then had the old man paid
6150	The forfeit of his life, but, good at need,
6150	The valiant Diomed his peril saw,
6150	And loudly shouting, on Ulysses call'd:
6150	"""Ulysses sage, Laertes' godlike son,"
6150	Why fliest thou, coward-like, amid the throng,
6150	And in thy flight to the aim of hostile spears
6150	Thy back presenting? stay, and here with me
6150	"From this fierce warrior guard the good old man."""
6150	""
6150	He said; but stout Ulysses heard him not,
6150	And to the ships pursued his hurried way.
6150	But in the front, Tydides, though alone,
6150	Remain'd undaunted; by old Nester's car
6150	He stood, and thus the aged chief address'd:
6150	"""Old man, these youthful warriors press thee sore,"
6150	Thy vigour spent, and with the weight of years
6150	Oppress'd; and helpless too thy charioteer,
6150	And slow thy horses; mount my car, and prove
6150	How swift my steeds, or in pursuit or flight,
6150	From those of Tros descended, scour the plain;
6150	My noble prize from great AEneas won.
6150	Leave to th' attendants these; while mine we launch
6150	Against the Trojan host, that Hector's self
6150	"May know how strong my hand can hurl the spear."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and Nestor his advice obey'd:
6150	The two attendants, valiant Sthenelus,
6150	And good Eurymedon, his horses took,
6150	While on Tydides' car they mounted both.
6150	The aged Nestor took the glitt'ring reins,
6150	And urg'd the horses; Hector soon they met:
6150	As on he came, his spear Tydides threw,
6150	Yet struck not Hector; but his charioteer,
6150	Who held the reins, the brave Thebaeus' son,
6150	Eniopeus, through the breast transfix'd,
6150	Beside the nipple; from the car he fell,
6150	The startled horses swerving at the sound;
6150	And from his limbs the vital spirit fled.
6150	Deep, for his comrade slain, was Hector's grief;
6150	Yet him, though griev'd, perforce he left to seek
6150	A charioteer; nor wanted long his steeds
6150	A guiding hand; for Archeptolemus,
6150	Brave son of Iphitus, he quickly found,
6150	And bade him mount his swiftly-flying car,
6150	And to his hands the glitt'ring reins transferr'd.
6150	""
6150	Then fearful ruin had been wrought, and deeds
6150	Untold achiev'd, and like a flock of lambs,
6150	The adverse hosts been coop'd beneath the walls,
6150	Had not the Sire of Gods and men beheld,
6150	And with an awful peal of thunder hurl'd
6150	His vivid lightning down; the fiery bolt
6150	Before Tydides' chariot plough'd the ground.
6150	Fierce flash'd the sulph'rous flame, and whirling round
6150	Beneath the yoke th' affrighted horses quailed.
6150	""
6150	From Nestor's hand escap'd the glitt'ring reins,
6150	And, trembling, thus to Diomed he spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Turn we to flight, Tydides; see'st thou not,"
6150	That Jove from us his aiding hand withholds?
6150	This day to Hector Saturn's son decrees
6150	The meed of vict'ry; on some future day,
6150	If so he will, the triumph may be ours;
6150	For man, how brave soe'er, cannot o'errule
6150	"The will of Jove, so much the mightier he."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the valiant Diomed:
6150	"""Truly, old man, and wisely dost thou speak;"
6150	But this the bitter grief that wrings my soul:
6150	Some day, amid the councillors of Troy
6150	Hector may say, 'Before my presence scar'd
6150	Tydides sought the shelter of the ships.'
6150	"Thus when he boasts, gape earth, and hide my shame!"""
6150	""
6150	To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
6150	"""Great son of Tydeus, oh what words are these!"
6150	Should Hector brand thee with a coward's name,
6150	No credence would he gain from Trojan men,
6150	Or Dardan, or from Trojan warriors' wives,
6150	"Whose husbands in the dust thy hand hath laid."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and 'mid the general rout, to flight
6150	He turn'd his horses; on the flying crowd,
6150	With shouts of triumph, Hector at their head,
6150	The men of Troy their murd'rous weapons show'r'd.
6150	Loud shouted Hector of the glancing helm:
6150	"""Tydides, heretofore the warrior Greeks"
6150	Have held thee in much honour; plac'd on high
6150	At banquets, and with lib'ral portions grac'd,
6150	And flowing cups: but thou, from this day forth,
6150	Shalt be their scorn! a woman's soul is thine!
6150	Out on thee, frighten'd girl! thou ne'er shalt scale
6150	Our Trojan tow'rs, and see me basely fly;
6150	Nor in thy ships our women bear away:
6150	"Ere such thy boast, my hand shall work thy doom."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; and greatly was Tydides mov'd
6150	To turn his horses, and confront his foe:
6150	Thrice thus he doubted; thrice, at Jove's command,
6150	From Ida's height the thunder peal'd, in sign
6150	Of vict'ry swaying to the Trojan side.
6150	Then to the Trojans Hector call'd aloud:
6150	"""Trojans, and Lycians, and ye Dardans, fam'd"
6150	In close encounter, quit ye now like men;
6150	Put forth your wonted valour; for I know
6150	That in his secret counsels Jove designs
6150	Glory to me, disaster to the Greeks.
6150	Fools, in those wretched walls that put their trust,
6150	Scarce worthy notice, hopeless to withstand
6150	My onset; and the trench that they have dug,
6150	Our horses easily can overleap;
6150	And when I reach the ships, be mindful ye,
6150	To have at hand the fire, wherewith the ships
6150	We may destroy, while they themselves shall fall
6150	"An easy prey, bewilder'd by the smoke."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and thus with cheering words address'd
6150	"His horses: ""Xanthus, and, Podargus, thou,"
6150	AEthon and Lampus, now repay the care
6150	On you bestow'd by fair Andromache,
6150	Eetion's royal daughter; bear in mind
6150	How she with ample store of provender
6150	Your mangers still supplied, before e'en I,
6150	Her husband, from her hands the wine-cup took.
6150	Put forth your speed, that we may make our prize
6150	Of Nestor's shield, whose praise extends to Heav'n,
6150	Its handles, and itself, of solid gold;
6150	And from the shoulders of Tydides strip
6150	His gorgeous breastplate, work of Vulcan's hand:
6150	These could we take, methinks this very night
6150	"Would see the Greeks embarking on their ships."""
6150	""
6150	Such was his pray'r; but Juno on her throne
6150	Trembled with rage, till great Olympus quak'd,
6150	And thus to Neptune, mighty God, she spoke:
6150	"""O thou of boundless might, Earth-shaking God,"
6150	See'st thou unmov'd the ruin of the Greeks?
6150	Yet they in AEgae and in Helice,
6150	With grateful off'rings rich thine altars crown;
6150	Then give we them the vict'ry; if we all
6150	Who favour Greece, together should combine
6150	To put to flight the Trojans, and restrain
6150	All-seeing Jove, he might be left alone,
6150	"On Ida's summit to digest his wrath."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, in anger, Neptune thus replied:
6150	"""O Juno, rash of speech, what words are these!"
6150	I dare not counsel that we all should join
6150	"'Gainst Saturn's son; so much the stronger he."""
6150	""
6150	Such converse held they; all the space meanwhile
6150	Within the trench, between the tow'r and ships,
6150	Was closely throng'd with steeds and buckler'd men;
6150	By noble Hector, brave as Mars, and led
6150	By Jove to vict'ry, coop'd in narrow space;
6150	Who now had burnt with fire the Grecian ships,
6150	But Juno bade Atrides haste to rouse
6150	Their fainting courage; through the camp he pass'd;
6150	On his broad hand a purple robe he bore,
6150	And stood upon Ulysses' lofty ship,
6150	The midmost, whence to shout to either side,
6150	Or to the tents of Ajax Telamon,
6150	Or of Achilles, who at each extreme,
6150	Confiding in their strength, had moor'd their ships.
6150	""
6150	Thence to the Greeks he shouted, loud and clear:
6150	"""Shame on ye, Greeks, base cowards, brave alone"
6150	In outward semblance! where are now the vaunts
6150	Which once (so highly of ourselves we deem'd)
6150	Ye made, vain-glorious braggarts as ye were,
6150	In Lemnos' isle, when, feasting on the flesh
6150	Of straight-horn'd oxen, and your flowing cups
6150	Crowning with ruddy wine, not one of you,
6150	But for a hundred Trojans in the field,
6150	Or for two hundred, deem'd himself a match:
6150	Now quail ye all before a single man,
6150	Hector, who soon will wrap our ships in fire.
6150	O Father Jove! what sov'reign e'er hast thou
6150	So far deluded, of such glory robb'd?
6150	Yet ne'er, on this disastrous voyage bent,
6150	Have I unheeded pass'd thine altar by;
6150	The choicest off'rings burning still on each,
6150	In hopes to raze the well-built walls of Troy.
6150	Yet to this pray'r at least thine ear incline;
6150	Grant that this coast in safety we may leave,
6150	"Nor be by Trojans utterly subdued."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and Jove, with pity, saw his tears;
6150	And, with a sign, his people's safety vouch'd.
6150	He sent an eagle, noblest bird that flies,
6150	Who in his talons bore a wild deer's fawn:
6150	The fawn he dropp'd beside the holy shrine,
6150	Where to the Lord of divination, Jove,
6150	The Greeks were wont their solemn rites to pay.
6150	The sign from Heav'n they knew; with courage fresh
6150	Assail'd the Trojans, and the fight renew'd.
6150	Then none of all the many Greeks might boast
6150	That he, before Tydides, drove his car
6150	Across the ditch, and mingled in the fight.
6150	His was the hand that first a crested chief,
6150	The son of Phradmon, Agelaus, struck.
6150	He turn'd his car for flight; but as he turn'd,
6150	The lance of Diomed, behind his neck,
6150	Between the shoulders, through his chest was driv'n;
6150	Headlong he fell, and loud his armour rang.
6150	""
6150	Next to Tydides, Agamemnon came,
6150	And Menelaus, Atreus' godlike sons;
6150	Th' Ajaces both, in dauntless courage cloth'd;
6150	Idomeneus, with whom Meriones,
6150	His faithful comrade, terrible as Mars;
6150	Eurypylus, Euaemon's noble son;
6150	The ninth was Teucer, who, with bended bow,
6150	Behind the shield of Ajax Telamon
6150	Took shelter; Ajax o'er him held his shield;
6150	Thence look'd he round, and aim'd amid the crowd;
6150	And as he saw each Trojan, wounded, fall,
6150	Struck by his shafts, to Ajax close he press'd,
6150	As to its mother's shelt'ring arms a child,
6150	Conceal'd and safe beneath the ample targe.
6150	""
6150	Say then, who first of all the Trojans fell
6150	By Teucer's arrows slain? Orsilochus,
6150	And Ophelestes, Daetor, Ormenus,
6150	And godlike Lycophontes, Chromius,
6150	And Amopaon, Polyaemon's son,
6150	And valiant Melanippus: all of these,
6150	Each after other, Teucer laid in dust.
6150	Him Agamemnon, with his well-strung bow
6150	Thinning the Trojan ranks, with joy beheld,
6150	And, standing at his side, address'd him thus:
6150	"""Teucer, good comrade, son of Telamon,"
6150	Shoot ever thus, if thou wouldst be the light
6150	And glory of the Greeks, and of thy sire,
6150	Who nursed thine infancy, and in his house
6150	Maintain'd, though bastard; him, though distant far,
6150	To highest fame let thine achievements raise.
6150	This too I say, and will make good my word:
6150	If by the grace of aegis-bearing Jove,
6150	And Pallas, Ilium's well-built walls we raze,
6150	A gift of honour, second but to mine,
6150	I in thy hands will place; a tripod bright,
6150	Or, with their car and harness, two brave steeds,
6150	"Or a fair woman who thy bed may share."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer valiant Teucer thus:
6150	"""Most mighty son of Atreus, why excite"
6150	Who lacks not zeal? To th' utmost of my pow'r
6150	Since first we drove the Trojans back, I watch,
6150	Unceasing, every chance to ply my shafts.
6150	Eight barbed arrows have I shot e'en now,
6150	And in a warrior each has found its mark;
6150	"That savage hound alone defeats my aim."""
6150	""
6150	At Hector, as he spoke, another shaft
6150	He shot, ambitious of so great a prize:
6150	He miss'd his aim; but Priam's noble son
6150	Gorgythion, through the breast his arrow struck,
6150	Whom from AEsyme brought, a wedded bride
6150	Of heavenly beauty, Castianeira bore.
6150	Down sank his head, as in a garden sinks
6150	A ripen'd poppy charg'd with vernal rains;
6150	So sank his head beneath his helmet's weight.
6150	At Hector yet another arrow shot
6150	Teucer, ambitious of so great a prize;
6150	Yet this too miss'd, by Phoebus turn'd aside;
6150	But Archeptolemus, the charioteer
6150	Of Hector, onward hurrying, through the breast
6150	It struck, beside the nipple; from the car
6150	He fell; aside the startled horses swerv'd;
6150	And as he fell the vital spirit fled.
6150	Deep, for his comrade slain, was Hector's grief;
6150	Yet him, though griev'd at heart, perforce he left,
6150	And to Cebriones, his brother, call'd,
6150	Then near at hand, the horses' reins to take;
6150	He heard, and straight obey'd; then Hector leap'd
6150	Down from his glitt'ring chariot to the ground,
6150	His fearful war-cry shouting; in his hand
6150	A pond'rous stone he carried; and, intent
6150	To strike him down, at Teucer straight he rush'd.
6150	He from his quiver chose a shaft in haste,
6150	And fitted to the cord; but as he drew
6150	The sinew, Hector of the glancing helm
6150	Hurl'd the huge mass of rock, which Teucer struck
6150	Near to the shoulder, where the collar-bone
6150	Joins neck and breast, the spot most opportune,
6150	And broke the tendon; paralys'd, his arm
6150	Dropp'd helpless by his side; upon his knees
6150	He fell, and from his hands let fall the bow.
6150	Not careless Ajax saw his brother's fall,
6150	But o'er him spread in haste his cov'ring shield.
6150	Two faithful friends, Mecisteus, Echius' son,
6150	And brave Alastor, from the press withdrew,
6150	And bore him, deeply groaning, to the ships.
6150	""
6150	Then Jove again the Trojan courage fir'd,
6150	And backward to the ditch they forc'd the Greeks.
6150	Proud of his prowess, Hector led them on;
6150	And as a hound that, fleet of foot, o'ertakes
6150	Or boar or lion, object of his chase,
6150	Springs from behind, and fastens on his flank,
6150	Yet careful watches, lest he turn to bay:
6150	So Hector press'd upon the long-hair'd Greeks,
6150	Slaying the hindmost; they in terror fled.
6150	But, pass'd at length the ditch and palisade,
6150	With loss of many by the Trojans slain,
6150	Before the ships they rallied from their flight,
6150	And one to other call'd: and one and all
6150	With hands uplifted, pray'd to all the Gods;
6150	While Hector, here and there, on ev'ry side
6150	His flying coursers wheel'd, with eyes that flash'd
6150	Awful as Gorgon's, or as blood-stain'd Mars.
6150	""
6150	Juno, the white-arm'd Queen, with pity mov'd,
6150	To Pallas thus her winged words address'd:
6150	"""O Heav'n, brave child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
6150	Can we, ev'n now, in this their sorest need,
6150	Refuse the Greeks our aid, by one subdued,
6150	One single man, of pride unbearable,
6150	Hector, the son of Priam, who e'en now,
6150	"Hath caus'd them endless grief?"" To whom again"
6150	The blue-ey'd Goddess, Pallas, thus replied:
6150	"""I too would fain behold him robb'd of life,"
6150	In his own country slain by Grecian hands;
6150	But that my sire, by ill advice misled,
6150	Rages in wrath, still thwarting all my plans;
6150	Forgetting now how oft his son I sav'd,
6150	Sore wearied with the toils Eurystheus gave.
6150	Oft would his tears ascend to Heav'n, and oft
6150	From Heav'n would Jove despatch me to his aid;
6150	But if I then had known what now I know,
6150	When to the narrow gates of Pluto's realm
6150	He sent him forth to bring from Erebus
6150	Its guardian dog, he never had return'd
6150	In safety from the marge of Styx profound.
6150	He holds me now in hatred, and his ear
6150	To Thetis lends, who kiss'd his knees, and touch'd
6150	His beard, and pray'd him to avenge her son
6150	Achilles; yet the time shall come when I
6150	Shall be once more his own dear blue-ey'd Maid.
6150	But haste thee now, prepare for us thy car,
6150	While to the house of aegis-bearing Jove
6150	I go, and don my armour for the fight,
6150	To prove if Hector of the glancing helm,
6150	The son of Priam, will unmov'd behold
6150	Us two advancing o'er the pass of war;
6150	Or if the flesh of Trojans, slain by Greeks,
6150	"Shall sate the maw of rav'ning dogs and birds."""
6150	""
6150	She said: the white-arm'd Queen her word obey'd.
6150	Juno, great Goddess, royal Saturn's child,
6150	The horses brought, with golden frontlets crown'd;
6150	While Pallas, child of aegis-bearing Jove,
6150	Within her father's threshold dropp'd her veil
6150	Of airy texture, work of her own hands;
6150	The cuirass donn'd of cloud-compelling Jove,
6150	And stood accoutred for the bloody fray.
6150	The fiery car she mounted; in her hand
6150	A spear she bore, long, weighty, tough; wherewith
6150	The mighty daughter of a mighty sire
6150	Sweeps down the ranks of those her wrath pursues.
6150	Then Juno sharply touch'd the flying steeds;
6150	Forthwith spontaneous opening, grated harsh
6150	The heavenly portals, guarded by the Hours,
6150	Who Heav'n and high Olympus have in charge,
6150	To roll aside or close the veil of cloud;
6150	Through these th' excited horses held their way.
6150	""
6150	From Ida's heights the son of Saturn saw,
6150	And, fill'd with wrath, the heav'nly messenger,
6150	The golden-winged Iris, thus bespoke:
6150	"""Haste thee, swift Iris; turn them back, and warn"
6150	That farther they advance not: 'tis not meet
6150	That they and I in war should be oppos'd.
6150	This too I say, and will make good my words:
6150	Their flying horses I will lame; themselves
6150	Dash from their car, and break their chariot-wheels;
6150	And ten revolving years heal not the wound
6150	Where strikes my lightning; so shall Pallas learn
6150	What 'tis against her father to contend.
6150	Juno less moves my wonder and my wrath;
6150	"Whate'er I plan, 'tis still her wont to thwart."""
6150	Thus he: from Ida to Olympus' height
6150	The storm-swift Iris on her errand sped.
6150	At many-ridg'd Olympus' outer gate
6150	She met the Goddesses, and stay'd their course,
6150	And thus convey'd the sov'reign will of Jove:
6150	""
6150	"""Whither away? what madness fills your breasts?"
6150	To give the Greeks your succour, Jove forbids;
6150	And thus he threatens, and will make it good:
6150	Your flying horses he will lame; yourselves
6150	Dash from the car, and break your chariot-wheels;
6150	And ten revolving years heal not the wounds
6150	His lightning makes: so, Pallas, shalt thou learn
6150	What 'tis against thy father to contend.
6150	Juno less moves his wonder and his wrath;
6150	Whate'er he plans, 'tis still her wont to thwart;
6150	But over-bold and void of shame art thou,
6150	"If against Jove thou dare to lift thy spear."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as she spoke, swift Iris disappear'd.
6150	"Then Juno thus to Pallas spoke: ""No more,"
6150	Daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, can we
6150	For mortal men his sov'reign will resist;
6150	Live they or die, as each man's fate may be;
6150	While he, 'twixt Greeks and Trojans, as 'tis meet,
6150	"His own designs accomplishing, decides."""
6150	She said, and backward turn'd her horses' heads.
6150	The horses from the car the Hours unyok'd,
6150	And safely tether'd in the heav'nly stalls;
6150	The car they rear'd against the inner wall,
6150	That brightly polish'd shone; the Goddesses
6150	Themselves meanwhile, amid th' Immortals all,
6150	With, sorrowing hearts on golden seats reclin'd.
6150	""
6150	Ere long, on swiftly-rolling chariot borne,
6150	Jove to Olympus, to th' abode of Gods,
6150	From Ida's height return'd: th' earth-shaking God,
6150	Neptune, unyok'd his steeds; and on the stand
6150	Secur'd the car, and spread the cov'ring o'er.
6150	Then on his golden throne all-seeing Jove
6150	Sat down; beneath his feet Olympus shook.
6150	Juno and Pallas only sat aloof;
6150	No word they utter'd, no enquiry made.
6150	Jove knew their thoughts, and thus address'd them both:
6150	"""Pallas and Juno, wherefore sit ye thus"
6150	In angry silence? In the glorious fight
6150	No lengthen'd toil have ye sustain'd, to slay
6150	The Trojans, whom your deadly hate pursues.
6150	Not all the Gods that on Olympus dwell
6150	Could turn me from my purpose, such my might,
6150	And such the pow'r of my resistless hand;
6150	But ye were struck with terror ere ye saw
6150	The battle-field, and fearful deeds of war.
6150	But this I say, and bear it in your minds,
6150	Had I my lightning launch'd, and from your car
6150	Had hurl'd ye down, ye ne'er had reach'd again
6150	"Olympus' height, th' immortal Gods' abode."""
6150	""
6150	So spoke the God; but, seated side by side,
6150	Juno and Pallas glances interchang'd
6150	Of ill portent for Troy; Pallas indeed
6150	Sat silent, and, though inly wroth with Jove,
6150	Yet answer'd not a word; but Juno's breast
6150	Could not contain her rage, and thus she spoke:
6150	"""What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
6150	Well do we know thy pow'r invincible,
6150	Yet deeply grieve we for the warlike Greeks,
6150	Condemn'd to hopeless ruin: from the fight,
6150	Since such is thy command, we stand aloof;
6150	But yet some saving counsel may we give,
6150	"Lest in thine anger thou destroy them quite."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
6150	"""Yet greater slaughter, stag-ey'd Queen of Heav'n,"
6150	To-morrow shalt thou see, if so thou list,
6150	Wrought on the warrior Greeks by Saturn's son;
6150	For Hector's proud career shall not be check'd
6150	Until the wrath of Peleus' godlike son
6150	Beside the ships be kindled, in the day
6150	When round Patroclus' corpse, in narrow space,
6150	E'en by the vessels' sterns, the war shall rage.
6150	Such is the voice of destiny: for thee,
6150	I reck not of thy wrath; nor should I care
6150	Though thou wert thrust beneath the lowest deep
6150	Of earth and ocean, where Iapetus
6150	And Saturn lie, uncheer'd by ray of sun
6150	Or breath of air, in Tartarus profound.
6150	Though there thou wert to banishment consign'd,
6150	I should not heed, but thy reproaches hear
6150	"Unmov'd; for viler thing is none than thou."""
6150	He said, but white-arm'd Juno answer'd not.
6150	""
6150	The sun, now sunk beneath the ocean wave,
6150	Drew o'er the teeming earth the veil of night.
6150	The Trojans saw, reluctant, day's decline;
6150	But on the Greeks thrice welcome, thrice invoked
6150	With earnest prayers, the shades of darkness fell.
6150	""
6150	The noble Hector then to council call'd
6150	The Trojan leaders; from the ships apart
6150	He led them, by the eddying river's side,
6150	To a clear space of ground, from corpses free.
6150	They from their cars dismounting, to the words
6150	Of godlike Hector listen'd: in his hand
6150	His massive spear he held, twelve cubits long,
6150	Whose glitt'ring point flash'd bright, with hoop of gold
6150	Encircled round; on this he leant, and said,
6150	"""Hear me, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies;"
6150	I hop'd that to the breezy heights of Troy
6150	We might ere now in triumph have return'd,
6150	The Grecian ships and all the Greeks destroy'd:
6150	But night hath come too soon, and sav'd awhile
6150	The Grecian army and their stranded ships.
6150	Then yield we to the night; prepare the meal;
6150	Unyoke your horses, and before them place
6150	Their needful forage; from the city bring
6150	Oxen and sheep; the luscious wine provide;
6150	Bring bread from out our houses; and collect
6150	Good store of fuel, that the livelong night,
6150	E'en till the dawn of day, may broadly blaze
6150	Our num'rous watchfires, and illume the Heav'ns;
6150	Lest, e'en by night, the long-hair'd Greeks should seek
6150	O'er the broad bosom of the sea to fly,
6150	That so not unassail'd they may embark,
6150	Nor undisturb'd; but haply some may bear,
6150	E'en to their homes, the mem'ry of a wound
6150	Receiv'd from spear or arrow, as on board
6150	They leap'd in haste; and others too may fear
6150	To tempt with hostile arms the pow'r of Troy.
6150	Then let the sacred heralds' voice proclaim
6150	Throughout the city, that the stripling youths
6150	And hoary-headed sires allot themselves
6150	In sev'ral watches to the Heav'n-built tow'rs.
6150	Charge too the women, in their houses each,
6150	To kindle blazing fires; let careful watch
6150	Be set, lest, in the absence of the men,
6150	The town by secret ambush be surpris'd.
6150	Such, valiant Trojans, is th' advice I give;
6150	And what to-night your wisdom shall approve
6150	Will I, at morn, before the Trojans speak.
6150	Hopeful, to Jove I pray, and all the Gods,
6150	To chase from hence these fate-inflicted hounds,
6150	By fate sent hither on their dark-ribb'd ships.
6150	Now keep we through the night our watchful guard;
6150	And with the early dawn, equipp'd in arms,
6150	Upon their fleet our angry battle pour.
6150	Then shall I know if Tydeus' valiant son
6150	Back from the ships shall drive me to the walls,
6150	Or I, triumphant, bear his bloody spoils:
6150	To-morrow morn his courage will decide,
6150	If he indeed my onset will await.
6150	But ere to-morrow's sun be high in Heav'n,
6150	He, 'mid the foremost, if I augur right,
6150	Wounded and bleeding in the dust shall lie,
6150	And many a comrade round him. Would to Heav'n
6150	I were as sure to be from age and death
6150	Exempt, and held in honour as a God,
6150	Phoebus, or Pallas, as I am assur'd
6150	"The coming day is fraught with ill to Greece."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Hector spoke; the Trojans shouted loud:
6150	Then from the yoke the sweating steeds they loos'd,
6150	And tether'd each beside their sev'ral cars:
6150	Next from the city speedily they brought
6150	Oxen and sheep; the luscious wine procur'd;
6150	Brought bread from out their houses, and good store
6150	Of fuel gather'd; wafted from the plain,
6150	The winds to Heav'n the sav'ry odours bore.
6150	Full of proud hopes, upon the pass of war,
6150	All night they camp'd; and frequent blaz'd their fires.
6150	""
6150	As when in Heav'n, around the glitt'ring moon
6150	The stars shine bright amid the breathless air;
6150	And ev'ry crag, and ev'ry jutting peak
6150	Stands boldly forth, and ev'ry forest glade;
6150	Ev'n to the gates of Heav'n is open'd wide
6150	The boundless sky; shines each particular star
6150	Distinct; joy fills the gazing shepherd's heart.
6150	So bright, so thickly scatter'd o'er the plain,
6150	Before the walls of Troy, between the ships
6150	And Xanthus' stream, the Trojan watchfires blaz'd.
6150	""
6150	A thousand fires burnt brightly; and round each
6150	Sat fifty warriors in the ruddy glare;
6150	Champing the provender before them laid,
6150	Barley and rye, the tether'd horses stood
6150	Beside the cars, and waited for the morn.

6150	""
6150	Agamemnon, after the last day's defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit
6150	the siege, and return to their country. Diomed opposes this, and Nestor
6150	seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to
6150	be strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what meabures
6150	were to be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice,
6150	and Nestor farther prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles in
6150	order to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are make choice
6150	of, who are accompanied by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very
6150	moving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by
6150	Achilles, who notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The

6150	Thus kept their watch, the Trojans; but the Greeks
6150	Dire Panic held, companion of chill Fear,
6150	Their bravest struck with grief unbearable.
6150	As when two stormy winds ruffle the sea,
6150	Boreas and Zephyr, from the hills of Thrace
6150	With sudden gust descending; the dark waves
6150	Rear high their angry crests, and toss on shore
6150	Masses of tangled weed; such stormy grief
6150	The breast of ev'ry Grecian warrior rent.
6150	""
6150	Atrides, heart-struck, wander'd to and fro,
6150	And to the clear-voic'd heralds gave command
6150	To call, but not with proclamation loud,
6150	Each sev'ral man to council; he himself
6150	Spar'd not his labour, mixing with the chiefs.
6150	Sadly they sat in council; Atreus' son,
6150	Weeping, arose; as some dark-water'd fount
6150	Pours o'er a craggy steep its gloomy stream;
6150	Then with deep groans th' assembled Greeks address'd:
6150	"""O friends! the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
6150	Grievous, and all unlook'd for, is the blow
6150	Which Jove hath dealt me; by his promise led
6150	I hop'd to raze the strong-built walls of Troy,
6150	And home return in safety; but it seems
6150	He falsifies his word, and bids me now
6150	Return to Argos, frustrate of my hope,
6150	Dishonour'd, and with grievous loss of men.
6150	Such now appears th' o'er-ruling sov'reign will
6150	Of Saturn's son, who oft hath sunk the heads
6150	Of many a lofty city in the dust,
6150	And yet will sink; for mighty is his hand.
6150	Hear then my counsel; let us all agree
6150	Home to direct our course: since here in vain
6150	"We strive to take the well-built walls of Troy."""
6150	""
6150	The monarch spoke; they all in silence heard:
6150	In speechless sorrow long they sat: at length
6150	Rose valiant Diomed, and thus he spoke:
6150	"""Atrides, I thy folly must confront,"
6150	As is my right, in council: thou, O King!
6150	Be not offended: once, among the Greeks
6150	Thou heldest light my prowess, with the name
6150	Of coward branding me; how justly so
6150	Is known to all the Greeks, both young and old.
6150	On thee the deep-designing Saturn's son
6150	In diff'ring measure hath his gifts bestow'd:
6150	A throne he gives thee, higher far than all;
6150	But valour, noblest boon of Heav'n, denies.
6150	How canst thou hope the sons of Greece shall prove
6150	Such heartless dastards as thy words suppose?
6150	If homeward to return thy mind be fix'd,
6150	Depart; the way is open, and the ships,
6150	Which from Mycenae follow'd thee in crowds,
6150	Are close at hand, and ready to be launch'd.
6150	Yet will the other long-hair'd Greeks remain
6150	Till Priam's city fall: nay, though the rest
6150	Betake them to their ships, and sail for home,
6150	Yet I and Sthenelus, we two, will fight
6150	"Till Troy be ours; for Heav'n is on our side."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; the sons of Greece, with loud applause,
6150	The speech of valiant Diomed confirm'd.
6150	""
6150	Then aged Nestor rose, and thus began:
6150	"""Tydides, eminent thou art in war;"
6150	And In the council thy compeers in age
6150	Must yield to thee; thy present words, no Greek
6150	Can censure, or gainsay; and yet the end
6150	Thou hast not reach'd, and object of debate.
6150	But thou art young, and for thine age mightst be
6150	My latest born; yet dost thou to the Kings
6150	Sage counsel give, and well in season speak.
6150	But now will I, that am thine elder far,
6150	Go fully through the whole; and none my words
6150	May disregard, not ev'n Atrides' self.
6150	Outcast from kindred, law, and hearth is he
6150	Whose soul delights in fierce internal strife.
6150	But yield we now to th' influence of night:
6150	Prepare the meal; and let the sev'ral guards
6150	Be posted by the ditch, without the wall.
6150	This duty on the younger men I lay:
6150	Then, Agamemnon, thou thy part perform;
6150	For thou art King supreme; the Elders all,
6150	As meet and seemly, to the feast invite:
6150	Thy tents are full of wine, which Grecian ships
6150	O'er the wide sea bring day by day from Thrace;
6150	Nor lack'st thou aught thy guests to entertain,
6150	And many own thy sway; when all are met,
6150	His counsel take, who gives the best advice;
6150	Great need we have of counsel wise and good,
6150	When close beside our ships the hostile fires
6150	Are burning: who can this unmov'd behold?
6150	"This night our ruin or our safety sees."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and they, assenting, heard his speech.
6150	Forth with their followers went th' appointed guards,
6150	The princely Thrasymedes, Nestor's son,
6150	Ascalaphus, and bold Ialmenus,
6150	Two valiant sons of Mars; Meriones,
6150	And Aphareus, and brave Deipyrus,
6150	And godlike Lycomedes, Creon's son.
6150	Sev'n were the leaders; and with each went forth
6150	A hundred gallant youths, with lances arm'd.
6150	Between the ditch and wall they took their post;
6150	There lit their fires, and there the meal prepar'd.
6150	""
6150	Then for th' assembled Elders in his tent
6150	An ample banquet Agamemnon spread;
6150	They on the viands, set before them, fell:
6150	The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,
6150	The aged Nestor first his mind disclos'd
6150	He who, before, the sagest counsel gave,
6150	Now thus with prudent words began, and said:
6150	""
6150	"""Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6150	With thee, Atrides, my discourse shall end,
6150	With thee begin: o'er many nations thou
6150	Hold'st sov'reign sway; since Jove to thee hath giv'n
6150	The sceptre, and the high prerogative,
6150	To be thy people's judge and counsellor,
6150	'Tis thine to speak the word, 'tis thine to hear
6150	And to determine, when some other chief
6150	Suggestions offers in the gen'ral cause:
6150	What counsel shall prevail, depends on thee:
6150	Yet will I say what seems to me the best.
6150	Sounder opinion none can hold than this,
6150	Which I maintain, and ever have maintain'd,
6150	Ev'n from the day when thou, great King, didst bear
6150	The fair Briseis from Achilles' tent
6150	Despite his anger--not by my advice:
6150	I fain would have dissuaded thee, but thou,
6150	Following the dictates of thy wrathful pride,
6150	Didst to our bravest wrong, dishon'ring him
6150	Whom ev'n th' Immortals honour'd; for his prize
6150	Thou took'st and still retain'st; but let us now
6150	Consider, if ev'n yet, with costly gifts
6150	"And soothing words, we may his wrath appease."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
6150	"""Father, too truly thou recall'st my fault:"
6150	I err'd, nor will deny it; as a host
6150	Is he whom Jove in honour holds, as now
6150	Achilles hon'ring, he confounds the Greeks,
6150	But if I err'd, by evil impulse led,
6150	Fain would I now conciliate him, and pay
6150	An ample penalty; before you all
6150	I pledge myself rich presents to bestow.
6150	Sev'n tripods will I give, untouch'd by fire;
6150	Of gold, ten talents, twenty caldrons bright,
6150	Twelve pow'rful horses, on the course renown'd,
6150	Who by their speed have many prizes won.
6150	Not empty-handed could that man be deem'd,
6150	Nor poor in gold, who but so much possess'd
6150	As by those horses has for me been won.
6150	Sev'n women too, well skill'd in household cares,
6150	Lesbians, whom I selected for myself,
6150	That day he captur'd Lesbos' goodly isle,
6150	In beauty far surpassing all their sex:
6150	These will I give; and with them will I send
6150	The fair Briseis, her whom from his tent
6150	I bore away; and add a solemn oath,
6150	I ne'er approach'd her bed, nor held with her
6150	Such intercourse as man with woman holds.
6150	All these shall now be his: but if the Gods
6150	Shall grant us Priam's city to destroy,
6150	Of gold and brass, when we divide the spoil,
6150	With countless heaps he shall a vessel freight,
6150	And twenty captives he himself shall choose,
6150	All only less than Argive Helen fair.
6150	And if it be our fate to see again
6150	The teeming soil of Argos, he shall be
6150	My son by marriage; and in honour held
6150	As is Orestes, who, my only son,
6150	Is rear'd at home in luxury and ease.
6150	Three daughters fair I have, Chrysothemis,
6150	Iphianassa, and Laodice;
6150	Of these, whiche'er he will, to Peleus' house,
6150	No portion ask'd for, he shall take to wife;
6150	And with her will I add such wedding gifts,
6150	As never man before to daughter gave.
6150	Sev'n prosp'rous towns besides; Cardamyle,
6150	And Enope, and Ira's grassy plains;
6150	And Pherae, and Antheia's pastures deep,
6150	AEpeia fair, and vine-clad Pedasus;
6150	All by the sea, by sandy Pylos' bounds.
6150	The dwellers there in flocks and herds are rich,
6150	And, as a God, shall honour him with gifts,
6150	And to his sceptre ample tribute pay.
6150	This will I do, so he his wrath remit:
6150	Then let him yield (Pluto alone remains
6150	Unbending and inexorable; and thence
6150	Of all the Gods is most abhorr'd of men),
6150	To me submitting, as in royal pow'r
6150	"Superior far, and more advanc'd in age."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
6150	"""Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6150	Atrides, not unworthy are the gifts,
6150	Which to Achilles thou design'st to send:
6150	Then to the tent of Peleus' son in haste
6150	Let us our chosen messengers despatch:
6150	Whom I shall choose, let them consent to go.
6150	Then first of all let Phoenix lead the way,
6150	Beloved of Jove; the mighty Ajax next:
6150	With them, Ulysses sage; and let them take,
6150	Of heralds, Hodius and Eurybates.
6150	Bring now the hallowing water for our hands;
6150	And bid be silent, while to Saturn's son,
6150	"That he have mercy, we address our pray'r."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and well his counsel pleas'd them all;
6150	The heralds pour'd the water on their hands;
6150	The youths, attending, crown'd the bowls with wine,
6150	And in due order serv'd the cups to all.
6150	Then, their libations made, when each with wine
6150	Had satisfied his soul, from out the tent
6150	Of Agamemnon, Atreus' son, they pass'd;
6150	And many a caution aged Nestor gave,
6150	With rapid glance to each, Ulysses chief,
6150	How best to soften Peleus' matchless son.
6150	""
6150	Beside the many-dashing ocean's shore
6150	They mov'd along; and many a pray'r address'd
6150	To Neptune, Ocean's Earth-surrounding God,
6150	That he to gentle counsels would incline
6150	The haughty soul of great AEacides.
6150	When to the ships and tents they came, where lay
6150	The warlike Myrmidons, their chief they found
6150	His spirit soothing with a sweet-ton'd lyre,
6150	Of curious work, with silver band adorn'd;
6150	Part of the spoil he took, when he destroy'd
6150	Eetion's wealthy town; on this he play'd,
6150	Soothing his soul, and sang of warriors' deeds.
6150	Before the chief, in silence and alone
6150	Patroclus sat, upon Achilles fix'd
6150	His eyes, awaiting till the song should cease.
6150	The envoys forward stepp'd, Ulysses first,
6150	And stood before him; from his couch, amaz'd,
6150	And holding still his lyre, Achilles sprang,
6150	Leaving the seat whereon they found him plac'd;
6150	And at their entrance rose Patroclus too:
6150	Waving his hand, Achilles, swift of foot,
6150	"Addressed them: ""Welcome, friends! as friends ye come:"
6150	Some great occasion surely to my tent
6150	Hath brought the men who are, of all the Greeks,
6150	"Despite my anger, dearest to my heart."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, he led them in, and plac'd
6150	On couches spread with, purple carpets o'er,
6150	Then thus address'd Patroclus at his side:
6150	"""Son of Menoetius, set upon the board"
6150	A larger bowl, and stronger mix the wine,
6150	And serve a cup to each: beneath my roof
6150	"This night my dearest friends I entertain."""
6150	He said; Patroclus his commands obey'd;
6150	And in the fire-light plac'd an ample tray,
6150	And on it laid of goat's flesh and of sheep's
6150	A saddle each; and with them, rich in fat,
6150	A chine of well-fed hog; Automedon
6150	Held fast, while great Achilles carv'd the joints.
6150	The meat, prepar'd, he fix'd upon the spits:
6150	Patroclus kindled then a blazing fire;
6150	And when the fire burnt hotly, and the flame
6150	Subsided, spread the glowing embers out,
6150	And hung the spits above; then sprinkled o'er
6150	The meat with salt, and lifted from the stand.
6150	The viands cook'd and plac'd upon the board,
6150	From baskets fair Patroclus portion'd out
6150	The bread to each; the meat Achilles shar'd.
6150	Facing the sage Ulysses, sat the host
6150	On th' other side the tent; and bade his friend,
6150	Patroclus, give the Gods their honours due:
6150	He in the fire the wonted off'rings burnt:
6150	They on the viands set before them fell.
6150	The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,
6150	Ajax to Phoenix sign'd: Ulysses saw
6150	The sign, and rising, fill'd a cup with wine,
6150	"And pledg'd Achilles thus: ""To thee I drink,"
6150	Achilles! nobly is thy table spread,
6150	As heretofore in Agamemnon's tent,
6150	So now in thine; abundant is the feast:
6150	But not the pleasures of the banquet now
6150	We have in hand: impending o'er our arms
6150	Grave cause of fear, illustrious chief, we see;
6150	Grave doubts, to save, or see destroy'd our ships,
6150	If thou, great warrior, put not forth thy might.
6150	For close beside the ships and wall are camp'd
6150	The haughty Trojans and renown'd allies:
6150	Their watch-fires frequent burn throughout the camp;
6150	And loud their boast that nought shall stay their hands,
6150	Until our dark-ribb'd ships be made their prey.
6150	Jove too for them, with fav'ring augury
6150	Sends forth his lightning; boastful of his strength,
6150	And firmly trusting in the aid of Jove,
6150	Hector, resistless, rages; nought he fears
6150	Or God or man, with martial fury fir'd.
6150	He prays, impatient, for th' approach of morn;
6150	Then, breaking through the lofty sterns, resolv'd
6150	To the devouring flames to give the ships,
6150	And slay the crews, bewilder'd in the smoke.
6150	And much my mind misgives me, lest the Gods
6150	His threats fulfil, and we be fated here
6150	To perish, far from Argos' grassy plains.
6150	Up then! if in their last extremity
6150	Thy spirit inclines, though late, to save the Greeks
6150	Sore press'd by Trojan arms: lest thou thyself
6150	Hereafter feel remorse; the evil done
6150	Is past all cure; then thou reflect betimes
6150	How from the Greeks to ward the day of doom.
6150	Dear friend, remember now thy father's words,
6150	The aged Peleus, when to Atreus' son
6150	He sent thee forth from Phthia, how he said,
6150	'My son, the boon of strength, if so they will,
6150	Juno or Pallas have the pow'r to give;
6150	But thou thyself thy haughty spirit must curb.
6150	For better far is gentle courtesy:
6150	And cease from angry strife, that so the Greeks
6150	The more may honour thee, both young and old.'
6150	Such were the words thine aged father spoke,
6150	Which thou hast now forgotten; yet, e'en now,
6150	Pause for awhile, and let thine anger cool;
6150	And noble gifts, so thou thy wrath remit,
6150	From Agamemnon shalt thou bear away.
6150	Listen to me, while I recount the gifts
6150	Which in his tent he pledg'd him to bestow.
6150	Sev'n tripods promis'd he, untouch'd by fire,
6150	Of gold, ten talents, twenty caldrons bright,
6150	Twelve pow'rful horses, in the course renown'd.
6150	Who by their speed have many prizes won.
6150	Not empty-handed could that man be deem'd,
6150	Nor poor in gold, who but so much possess'd
6150	As by those horses has for him been won.
6150	Sev'n women too, well skill'd in household cares,
6150	Lesbians, whom he selected for himself,
6150	That day thou captur'dst Lesbos' goodly isle,
6150	In beauty far surpassing all their sex.
6150	These will he give; and with them will he send
6150	The fair Briseis, her whom from thy tent
6150	He bore away; and add a solemn oath,
6150	He ne'er approach'd her bed, nor held with her
6150	Such intercourse as man with woman holds.
6150	All these shall now be thine: but if the Gods
6150	Shall grant us Priam's city to destroy,
6150	Of gold and brass, when we divide the spoil,
6150	With countless heaps a vessel shalt thou freight,
6150	And twenty captives thou thyself shalt choose,
6150	All only less than Argive Helen fair.
6150	And if it be our fate to see again
6150	The teeming soil of Argos, thou mayst be
6150	His son by marriage, and in honour held
6150	As is Orestes, who, his only son,
6150	Is rear'd at home in luxury, and ease.
6150	Three daughters fair are his, Chrysothemis,
6150	Iphianassa, and Laodice;
6150	Of these whiche'er thou wilt, to Peleus' house,
6150	No portion ask'd for, thou shalt take to wife;
6150	And with her will he add such wedding gifts,
6150	As never man before to daughter gave.
6150	Sev'n prosp'rous towns besides; Cardamyle,
6150	And Enope, and Ira's grassy plains,
6150	And Pherae, and Antheia's pastures deep,
6150	AEpeia fair, and vine-clad Pedasus;
6150	All by the sea, by sandy Pylos' bounds.
6150	The dwellers there in flocks and herds are rich,
6150	And, as a God, will honour thee with gifts,
6150	And to thy sceptre ample tribute pay.
6150	All these he gives, so thou thy wrath remit.
6150	But if thou hold Atrides in such hate,
6150	Him and his gifts, yet let thy pity rest
6150	On all the other Greeks, thus sore bested;
6150	By whom thou shalt be honour'd as a God:
6150	For great the triumph that thou now mayst gain;
6150	E'en Hector's self is now within thy reach;
6150	For he is near at hand; and in his pride
6150	And martial fury deems that none, of all
6150	"Our ships contain, can rival him in arms."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""Heav'n-born Ulysses, sage in council, son"
6150	Of great Laertes, I must frankly speak
6150	My mind at once, my fix'd resolve declare:
6150	That from henceforth I may not by the Greeks,
6150	By this man and by that, be importun'd.
6150	Him as the gates of hell my soul abhors,
6150	Whose outward words his secret thoughts belie,
6150	Hear then what seems to me the wisest course.
6150	On me nor Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
6150	Nor others shall prevail, since nought is gain'd
6150	By toil unceasing in the battle field.
6150	Who nobly fight, but share with those who skulk;
6150	Like honours gain the coward and the brave;
6150	Alike the idlers and the active die:
6150	And nought it profits me, though day by day
6150	In constant toil I set my life at stake;
6150	But as a bird, though ill she fare herself,
6150	Brings to her callow brood the food she takes,
6150	So I through many a sleepless night have lain,
6150	And many a bloody day have labour'd through,
6150	Engag'd in battle on your wives' behalf.
6150	Twelve cities have I taken with my ships;
6150	Eleven more by land, on Trojan soil:
6150	From all of these abundant stores of wealth
6150	I took, and all to Agamemnon gave;
6150	He, safe beside his ships, my spoils receiv'd,
6150	A few divided, but the most retain'd.
6150	To other chiefs and Kings he meted out
6150	Their sev'ral portions, and they hold them still;
6150	From me, from me alone of all the Greeks,
6150	He bore away, and keeps my cherish'd wife;
6150	Well! let him keep her, solace of his bed!
6150	But say then, why do Greeks with Trojans fight?
6150	Why hath Atrides brought this mighty host
6150	To Troy, if not in fair-hair'd Helen's cause?
6150	Of mortals are there none that love their wives,
6150	Save Atreus' sons alone? or do not all,
6150	Who boast the praise of sense and virtue, love
6150	And cherish each his own? as her I lov'd
6150	E'en from my soul, though captive of my spear.
6150	Now, since he once hath robb'd me, and deceiv'd,
6150	Let him not seek my aid; I know him now,
6150	And am not to be won; let him devise,
6150	With thee, Ulysses, and the other Kings,
6150	How best from hostile fires to save his ships.
6150	He hath completed many mighty works
6150	Without my aid; hath built a lofty wall,
6150	And dug a trench around it, wide and deep,
6150	And in the trench hath fix'd a palisade;
6150	Nor so the warrior-slayer Hector's might
6150	Can keep in check; while I was in the field,
6150	Not far without the walls would Hector range
6150	His line of battle, nor beyond the Oak
6150	And Scaean gates would venture; there indeed
6150	He once presum'd to meet me, hand to hand,
6150	And from my onset narrowly escap'd.
6150	But as with Hector now no more I fight,
6150	To-morrow morn, my off'rings made to Jove,
6150	And all the Gods, and freighted well my ships,
6150	And launch'd upon the main, thyself shall see,
6150	If that thou care to see, my vessels spread
6150	O'er the broad bosom of the Hellespont,
6150	My lusty crews plying the vig'rous oar;
6150	And if th' Earth-shaker send a fav'ring breeze,
6150	Three days will bear us home to Phthia's shore.
6150	There did I leave abundant store of wealth,
6150	When hitherward I took my luckless way;
6150	Thither from hence I bear, of ruddy gold,
6150	And brass, and women fair, and iron hoar
6150	The share assign'd me; but my chiefest prize
6150	The monarch Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
6150	Himself who gave, with insult takes away.
6150	To him then speak aloud the words I send,
6150	That all may know his crimes, if yet he hope
6150	Some other Greek by treach'rous wiles to cheat,
6150	Cloth'd as he is in shamelessness! my glance,
6150	All brazen as he is, he dare not meet.
6150	I share no more his counsels, nor his acts;
6150	He hath deceiv'd me once, and wrong'd; again
6150	He shall not cozen me! Of him, enough!
6150	I pass him by, whom Jove hath robb'd of sense.
6150	His gifts I loathe, and spurn; himself I hold
6150	At a hair's worth; and would he proffer me
6150	Tenfold or twentyfold of all he has,
6150	Or ever may be his; or all the gold
6150	Sent to Orchomenos or royal Thebes,
6150	Egyptian, treasurehouse of countless wealth,
6150	Who boasts her hundred gates, through each of which
6150	With horse and car two hundred warriors march:
6150	Nay, were his gifts in number as the sand,
6150	Or dust upon the plain, yet ne'er will I
6150	By Agamemnon be prevail'd upon,
6150	Till I have paid him back my heart's offence.
6150	Nor e'er of Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
6150	Will I a daughter wed; not were she fair
6150	As golden Venus, and in works renown'd
6150	As Pallas, blue-ey'd Maid, yet her e'en so
6150	I wed not; let him choose some other Greek,
6150	Some fitting match, of nobler blood than mine.
6150	But should the Gods in safety bring me home,
6150	At Peleus' hands I may receive a wife;
6150	And Greece can boast of many a lovely maid,
6150	In Hellas or in Phthia, daughters fair
6150	Of chiefs who hold their native fortresses:
6150	Of these, at will, a wife I may select:
6150	And ofttimes hath my warlike soul inclin'd
6150	To take a wedded wife, a fitting bride,
6150	And aged Peleus' wealth in peace enjoy.
6150	For not the stores which Troy, they say, contain'd
6150	In peaceful times, ere came the sons of Greece,
6150	Nor all the treasures which Apollo's shrine,
6150	The Archer-God, in rock-built Pythos holds,
6150	May weigh with life; of oxen and of sheep
6150	Successful forays may good store provide;
6150	And tripods may be gain'd, and noble steeds:
6150	But when the breath of man hath pass'd his lips,
6150	Nor strength nor foray can the loss repair.
6150	I by my Goddess-mother have been warn'd,
6150	The silver-footed Thetis, that o'er me
6150	A double chance of destiny impends:
6150	If here remaining, round the walls of Troy
6150	I wage the war, I ne'er shall see my home,
6150	But then undying glory shall be mine:
6150	If I return, and see my native land,
6150	My glory all is gone; but length of life
6150	Shall then be mine, and death be long deferr'd.
6150	If others ask'd my counsel, I should say,
6150	'Homeward direct your course; of lofty Troy
6150	Ye see not yet the end; all-seeing Jove
6150	O'er her extends his hand; on him relying
6150	Her people all with confidence are fill'd.'
6150	Go then; my answer to the chiefs of Greece
6150	Speak boldly--such the privilege of age--
6150	Bid that some better counsel they devise
6150	To save their ships and men; their present scheme,
6150	My anger unappeas'd, avails them nought.
6150	But Phoenix here shall stay, and sleep to-night;
6150	And with the morrow he with me shall sail
6150	And seek our native land, if so he will:
6150	"For not by force will I remove him hence."""
6150	""
6150	He said; they all, confounded by his words,
6150	In silence heard; so sternly did he speak.
6150	At length, in tears, the aged Phoenix spoke,
6150	For greatly fear'd he for the ships of Greece:
6150	"""If, great Achilles, on returning home"
6150	Thy mind is set, nor canst thou be induc'd
6150	To save the ships from fire, so fierce thy wrath;
6150	How then, dear boy, can I remain behind,
6150	Alone? whom with thee aged Peleus sent,
6150	That day when he in Agamemnon's cause
6150	From Phthia sent thee, inexperienc'd yet
6150	In all the duties of confed'rate war,
6150	And sage debate, on which attends renown.
6150	Me then he sent, instructor of thy youth,
6150	To prompt thy language, and thine acts to guide.
6150	So not from thee, dear boy, can I consent
6150	To part, though Heav'n should undertake my age
6150	To prompt thy language, and thine acts to guide.
6150	So not from thee, dear boy, can I consent
6150	To part, though Heav'n should undertake my age
6150	To wipe away, and vig'rous youth restore,
6150	Such as I boasted, when from Greece I fled
6150	Before my angry sire, Amyntor, son
6150	Of Ormenus; a fair-hair'd concubine
6150	Cause of the quarrel; her my father lov'd,
6150	And by her love estrang'd, despis'd his wife,
6150	My mother; oft she pray'd me to seduce,
6150	To vex th' old man, my father's concubine;
6150	I yielded; he, suspecting, on my head
6150	A curse invok'd, and on the Furies call'd
6150	His curse to witness, that upon his knees
6150	No child, by me begotten, e'er should sit:
6150	His curse the Gods have heard, and ratified,
6150	Th' infernal King, and awful Proserpine.
6150	Then would I fain have slain him with the sword,
6150	Had not some God my rising fury quell'd,
6150	And set before my mind the public voice,
6150	The odium I should have to bear 'mid Greeks,
6150	If branded with the name of patricide.
6150	But longer in my angry father's house
6150	To dwell, my spirit brook'd not, though my friends
6150	And kinsmen all besought me to remain;
6150	And many a goodly sheep, and many a steer
6150	They slew, and many swine, with fat o'erlaid,
6150	They sing'd, and roasted o'er the burning coals;
6150	And drank in many a cup the old man's wine.
6150	Nine nights they kept me in continual watch,
6150	By turns relieving guards. The fires meanwhile
6150	Burnt constant: one beneath the porch that fac'd
6150	The well-fenc'd court; one in the vestibule
6150	Before my chamber door. The tenth dark night
6150	My chamber's closely-fitting doors I broke,
6150	And lightly vaulted o'er the court-yard fence,
6150	By guards alike and servant maids unmark'd.
6150	Through all the breadth of Hellas then I fled,
6150	Until at length to Phthia's fruitful soil,
6150	Mother of flocks, to Peleus' realm I came,
6150	Who kindly welcom'd me, and with such love
6150	As to his only son, his well-belov'd,
6150	A father shows, his gen'rous gifts bestow'd.
6150	He gave me wealth, he gave me ample rule;
6150	And on the bounds of Phthia bade me dwell,
6150	And o'er the Dolopes hold sov'reign sway.
6150	Thee too, Achilles, rival of the Gods,
6150	Such, as thou art I made thee; from my soul
6150	I lov'd thee; nor wouldst thou with others go
6150	Or to the meal, or in the house be fed,
6150	Till on my knee thou satt'st, and by my hand
6150	Thy food were cut, the cup were tender'd thee;
6150	And often, in thy childish helplessness.
6150	The bosom of my dress with wine was drench'd;
6150	Such care I had of thee, such pains I took,
6150	Rememb'ring that by Heav'n's decree, no son
6150	Of mine I e'er might see; then thee I made,
6150	Achilles, rival of the Gods, my son,
6150	That thou mightst be the guardian of mine age.
6150	But thou, Achilles, curb thy noble rage;
6150	A heart implacable beseems thee not.
6150	The Gods themselves, in virtue, honour, strength,
6150	Excelling thee, may yet be mollified;
6150	For they, when mortals have transgress'd, or fail'd
6150	To do aright, by sacrifice and pray'r,
6150	Libations and burnt-off'rings, may be sooth'd.
6150	Pray'rs are the daughters of immortal Jove;
6150	But halt, and wrinkled, and of feeble sight,
6150	They plod in Ate's track; while Ate, strong
6150	And swift of foot, outstrips their laggard pace,
6150	And, dealing woe to man, o'er all the earth
6150	Before them flies: they, following, heal her wounds.
6150	Him who with honour welcomes their approach,
6150	They greatly aid, and hear him when he prays;
6150	But who rejects, and sternly casts them off,
6150	To Saturn's son they go, and make their pray'r
6150	That Ate follow him and claim her dues.
6150	Then to the daughters of immortal Jove,
6150	Do thou, Achilles, show the like respect,
6150	That many another brave man's heart hath sway'd.
6150	If to thy tent no gifts Atrides brought,
6150	With promises of more, but still retain'd
6150	His vehement enmity, I could not ask
6150	That thou thy cherish'd anger shouldst discard,
6150	And aid the Greeks, how great so-e'er their need.
6150	But now large off'rings hath he giv'n, and more
6150	Hath promis'd; and, of all the Greeks, hath sent
6150	To pray thine aid, the men thou lov'st the best.
6150	Discredit not their mission, nor their words.
6150	Till now, I grant thee, none could blame thy wrath.
6150	In praise of men in ancient days renown'd,
6150	This have we heard, that how-so-e'er might rage
6150	Their hostile feuds, their anger might be still
6150	By gifts averted, and by words appeas'd.
6150	One case I bear in mind, in times long past,
6150	And not in later days; and here, 'mid friends,
6150	How all occurr'd, will I at length recite.
6150	Time was, that with AEtolia's warlike bands
6150	Round Calydon the Acarnanians fought
6150	With mutual slaughter; these to save the town,
6150	The Acarnanians burning to destroy.
6150	This curse of war the golden-throned Queen
6150	Diana sent, in anger that from her
6150	OEneus the first-fruits of his field withheld.
6150	The other Gods their hecatombs receiv'd;
6150	Diana's shrine alone no off'rings deck'd,
6150	Neglected, or o'erlook'd; the sin was great;
6150	And in her wrath the arrow-darting Queen
6150	A savage wild-boar sent, with gleaming tusks,
6150	Which OEneus' vineyard haunting, wrought him harm.
6150	There laid he prostrate many a stately tree,
6150	With root and branch, with blossom and with fruit.
6150	Him Meleager, son of OEneus, slew,
6150	With youths and dogs from all the neighbouring towns
6150	Collected; smaller force had not avail'd,
6150	So huge he was, so fierce; and many a youth
6150	Had by his tusks been laid upon the bier.
6150	A fierce contention then the Goddess rais'd,
6150	For the boar's head and bristly hide, between
6150	The Acarnanian and th' AEtolian bands.
6150	While warlike Meleager kept the field,
6150	So long the Acarnanians far'd but ill;
6150	Nor dar'd, despite the numbers of their host,
6150	Maintain their ground before the city walls.
6150	When he to anger yielded, which sometimes
6150	Swells in the bosom e'en of wisest men,
6150	Incens'd against his mother, he withdrew
6150	To Cleopatra fair, his wedded wife;
6150	(Marpessa her, Evenus' daughter, bore
6150	To Idas, strongest man of all who then
6150	Were living, who against Apollo's self
6150	For the neat-footed maiden bent his bow.
6150	Her parents call'd the child Alcyone,
6150	In mem'ry of the tears her mother shed,
6150	Rival of Alcyon's melancholy fate,
6150	When by far-darting Phoebus forc'd away).
6150	With her, retiring from the field, he nurs'd
6150	His wrath; resenting thus his mother's curse,
6150	Althaea; she her brother's death bore hard,
6150	And pray'd to Heav'n above, and with her hands
6150	Beating the solid earth, the nether pow'rs,
6150	Pluto and awful Proserpine, implor'd,
6150	Down on her knees, her bosom wet with tears,
6150	Death on her son invoking; from the depths
6150	Of Erebus Erinnys heard her pray'r,
6150	Gloom-haunting Goddess, dark and stern of heart.
6150	Soon round the gates the din of battle rose,
6150	The tow'rs by storm assaulted; then his aid
6150	Th' AEtonian Elders and the sacred priests
6150	With promises of great reward implor'd.
6150	A fruitful plot they bade him set apart,
6150	The richest land in lovely Calydon,
6150	Of fifty acres: half for vineyard meet,
6150	And half of fertile plain, for tillage clear'd.
6150	Upon the threshold of his lofty rooms
6150	Old OEneus stood, and at the portals clos'd
6150	He knock'd in vain, a suppliant to his son.
6150	His sisters and his brother join'd their pray'rs,
6150	But sterner his rejection of their suit;
6150	The friends he valued most, and lov'd the best,
6150	Yet they too fail'd his fix'd resolve to shake;
6150	Till to his very doors the war had reach'd,
6150	The foe upon the tow'rs, the town in flames:
6150	Then Meleager's beauteous wife, at length,
6150	In tears, beseeching him, the thousand ills
6150	Recall'd, which on a captur'd town attend;
6150	The slaughter'd men, the city burnt with fire,
6150	The helpless children and deep-bosom'd dames
6150	A prey to strangers. List'ning to the tale,
6150	His spirit was rous'd within him; and again
6150	He took the field, and donn'd his glitt'ring arms.
6150	Thus did his act from doom th' AEtolians save
6150	Spontaneous; yet he gain'd not, though he sav'd,
6150	The rich reward they once were pledg'd to give.
6150	But be not thou like him, nor let thy God
6150	Turn thitherward thy thoughts; our ships on fire,
6150	Thine aid will less be priz'd; come, take the gifts,
6150	And as a God be honour'd by the Greeks.
6150	If thou hereafter, unsolicited,
6150	The battle join, the Greeks thou mayst protect,
6150	"But not an equal share of honour gain."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""Phoenix, my second father, rev'rend sire,"
6150	Such honours move me not; my honour comes
6150	From Jove, whose will it is that I should here
6150	Remain beside the ships, while I retain
6150	Breath in my lungs and vigour in my limbs.
6150	This too I say, and bear it in thy mind:
6150	Disturb me not with weeping and complaints,
6150	To do Atrides grace; if him thou love,
6150	My love for thee perchance may turn to hate:
6150	My friend should honour him who honours me.
6150	But come with me, and of my kingdom half,
6150	And equal honours shalt thou share with me.
6150	These shall our message bear; stay thou the while,
6150	And on soft couch repose; to-morrow morn
6150	"Will we determine or to sail or stay."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and with his eyebrows gave a sign
6150	In silence to Patroclus, to prepare
6150	A bed for Phoenix, that without delay
6150	The rest might leave the tent; then thus began
6150	Ajax, the godlike son of Telamon:
6150	"""Ulysses sage, Laertes' high-born son,"
6150	Depart we now; for this way our discourse
6150	Can lead to no result; behoves us bear
6150	Our tidings, all unwelcome as they are,
6150	Back to the chiefs awaiting our return.
6150	Achilles hath allow'd his noble heart
6150	To cherish rancour and malignant hate;
6150	Nor reeks he of his old companions' love,
6150	Wherewith we honour'd him above the rest.
6150	Relentless he! a son's or brother's death,
6150	By payment of a fine, may be aton'd;
6150	The slayer may remain in peace at home,
6150	The debt discharg'd; the other will forego,
6150	The forfeiture receiv'd, his just revenge;
6150	But thou maintain'st a stern, obdurate mood.
6150	And for a single girl! we offer sev'n,
6150	Surpassing fair, and other gifts to boot.
6150	We now bespeak thy courtesy; respect
6150	Thy hearth; remember that beneath thy roof
6150	We stand, deputed by the gen'ral voice
6150	Of all the host; and fain would claim to be,
6150	"Of all the Greeks, thy best and dearest friends."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""Illustrious Ajax, son of Telamon,"
6150	Without offence hast thou thy message giv'n;
6150	But fury fills my soul, whene'er I think
6150	How Agamemnon, 'mid th' assembled Greeks,
6150	Insulting, held me forth to public scorn,
6150	As some dishonour'd, houseless vagabond.
6150	But go ye now, and bear my answer back:
6150	No more in bloody war will I engage,
6150	Till noble Hector, Priam's godlike son,
6150	O'er slaughter'd Greeks, your ships enwrapp'd in fire,
6150	Shall reach the quarters of the Myrmidons.
6150	Ere he assail my ship and tents, I think
6150	"That Hector, valiant as he is, will pause."""
6150	Thus he: they each the double goblet rais'd,
6150	And, to the Gods their due libations pour'd,
6150	Ulysses leading, to the ships return'd.
6150	""
6150	Meanwhile Patroclus bade th' attendant maids
6150	Prepare a bed for Phoenix; they obey'd,
6150	And quickly laid the bed with fleeces warm,
6150	And rugs, and linen light and fine o'erspread.
6150	There slept th' old man, and waited for the morn.
6150	Within the tent's recess Achilles slept;
6150	And by his side, from Lesbos captive brought,
6150	Daughter of Phorbas, Diomede fair;
6150	On th' other side Patroclus lay; with him
6150	The graceful Iphis, whom, when Scyros' isle
6150	He captur'd, and Enyes' rock-built fort,
6150	Achilles to his lov'd companion gave.
6150	""
6150	When to Atrides' tent the envoys came,
6150	The chiefs, uprising, pledg'd them one by one
6150	In golden goblets; then their tidings ask'd.
6150	First Agamemnon, King of men, enquir'd:
6150	"""Tell me, renown'd Ulysses, pride of Greece,"
6150	What says he: will he save our ships from fire,
6150	"Or still, in wrathful mood, withhold his aid?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom again Ulysses, stout of heart:
6150	"""Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6150	His anger is not quench'd, but fiercer still
6150	It glows; thy gifts and thee alike he spurns;
6150	He bids thee with the other chiefs concert
6150	The means thy people and thy ships to save;
6150	And menaces himself at early dawn
6150	To launch his well-trimm'd vessels on the main.
6150	Nay more, he counsels others, so he says,
6150	Homeward to turn, since here of lofty Troy
6150	We see not yet the end; all-seeing Jove
6150	O'er her extends his hand; on him relying,
6150	Her people all with confidence are fill'd.
6150	Such was his language; here before you stand
6150	Ajax and both the heralds, sage, grave men,
6150	Who with me went, and will confirm my words.
6150	Old Phoenix left we there, so will'd the chief,
6150	That with the morrow he with him may sail,
6150	And seek their native land, if so he will;
6150	"For not by force will he remove him hence."""
6150	""
6150	Ulysses thus; they all in silence heard,
6150	Amaz'd, so stern the message that he bore.
6150	Long time in silence sat the chiefs of Greece.
6150	Outspoke at length the valiant Diomed:
6150	"""Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6150	Would that thou ne'er hadst stoop'd with costly gifts
6150	To sue for aid from Peleus' matchless son;
6150	For he before was over-proud, and now
6150	Thine offers will have tenfold swoll'n his pride.
6150	But leave we him, according to his will,
6150	To go or stay: he then will join the fight,
6150	When his own spirit shall prompt, or Heav'n inspire.
6150	But hear ye all, and do as I advise:
6150	Refresh'd with food and wine (for therein lie
6150	Both strength and courage), turn we to our rest;
6150	And when the rosy-finger'd morn appears,
6150	Thyself among the foremost, with bold hearts,
6150	"Before our ships both horse and foot array."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and all the chiefs with loud applause
6150	His speech confirm'd; then, due libations pour'd,
6150	Each to his sev'ral tent they all withdrew;
6150	Then laid them down, and sought the boon of sleep.

6150	ARGUMENT.
6150	""
6150	THE NIGHT ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of
6150	Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that
6150	night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving
6150	all possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses,
6150	and Diomed, are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call
6150	a council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemy's camp,
6150	to learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed
6150	undertakes the hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for
6150	his companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had
6150	sent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are
6150	informed of the situation of the Trojans and auxiliary forces, and
6150	particularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians, who were lately arrived.
6150	They pass on with success; kill Rhesus with several of his officers,
6150	and seize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in
6150	triumph to the camp.
6150	""
6150	The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.

6150	BOOK X.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	In night-long slumbers lay the other chiefs
6150	Of all the Greeks, by gentle sleep subdued;
6150	But not on Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
6150	By various cares oppress'd, sweet slumber fell.
6150	As when from Jove, the fair-hair'd Juno's Lord,
6150	Flashes the lightning, bringing in its train
6150	Tempestuous storm of mingled rain and hail
6150	Or snow, by winter sprinkled o'er the fields;
6150	Or op'ning wide the rav'nous jaws of war;
6150	So Agamemnon from his inmost heart
6150	Pour'd forth in groans his multitudinous grief,
6150	His spirit within him sinking. On the plain
6150	He look'd, and there, alarm'd, the watchfires saw,
6150	Which, far advanc'd before the walls of Troy,
6150	Blaz'd numberless; and thence of pipes and flutes
6150	He heard the sound, and busy hum of men.
6150	Upon the ships he look'd, and men of Greece,
6150	And by the roots his hair in handfuls tore
6150	To Jove on high; deep groan'd his mighty heart.
6150	Thus as he mus'd, the wisest course appear'd,
6150	With Nestor, son of Neleus, to confer,
6150	If they some scheme in council might devise
6150	To ward destruction from the Grecian host.
6150	He rose, and o'er his body drew his vest,
6150	And underneath his well-turn'd feet he bound
6150	His sandals fair; then o'er his shoulders threw,
6150	Down reaching to his feet, a lion's skin,
6150	Tawny and vast; then grasp'd his pond'rous spear.
6150	""
6150	On Menelaus weigh'd an equal dread;
6150	Nor on his eyes that night had slumber sat,
6150	Lest ill befall the Greeks; who, in his cause,
6150	Crossing the wat'ry waste, had come to Troy,
6150	And bold defiance to the Trojans giv'n.
6150	Round his broad chest a panther's skin he threw;
6150	Then on his head his brazen helmet plac'd,
6150	And in his brawny hand a lance he bore.
6150	To meet his brother went he forth, of Greece
6150	The mighty monarch, as a God rever'd.
6150	Him by the ship he found, in act to arm;
6150	And welcome was his presence to the King.
6150	""
6150	Then valiant Menelaus first began:
6150	"""Why thus in arms, good brother? seek'st thou one"
6150	The Trojan camp to spy? I greatly fear
6150	That none will undertake the task, alone
6150	To spy the movements of the hostile camp
6150	"In the dark night: stout-hearted he must be."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
6150	"""Great need, my noble brother, have we both"
6150	Of sagest counsels, if we hope the Greeks
6150	And Grecian ships from ruin to preserve,
6150	Since turn'd against us is the mind of Jove.
6150	To Hector's off'rings most his soul inclines;
6150	For never have I seen, or heard men tell,
6150	How in one day one man has wrought such loss
6150	As Hector, dear to Jove, yet not the son
6150	Of God or Goddess, on the Greeks has wrought.
6150	Such deeds hath he achiev'd, such havoc made,
6150	As we shall long in bitter mem'ry keep.
6150	Haste thou amid the ships, and hither bring
6150	Idomeneus and Ajax; I the while
6150	Will Nestor rouse, and urge that he with us
6150	The outposts visit, and instruct the guard.
6150	To him they best will listen; for his son
6150	Commands the watch; with him Meriones,
6150	The follower of the King Idomeneus:
6150	"To them by pref'rence hath this charge been giv'n."""
6150	""
6150	He said: and Menelaus answer'd thus:
6150	"""What wouldst thou have me do then? here remain"
6150	With them, and wait thy coming, or to them
6150	"Thy message give, and follow in thy steps?"""
6150	""
6150	Him answer'd Agamemnon, King of men:
6150	"""Remain thou here, lest haply we might fail"
6150	To meet; for in the camp are many paths.
6150	But thou, where'er thou go'st, each sev'ral man
6150	Address, and ask to rise; to each his name
6150	And patronymic giving; pay to each
6150	All due respect; nor bear thee haughtily;
6150	We like the rest must share the load of toil.
6150	"Which Jove assigns to all of mortal birth."""
6150	""
6150	His brother thus with counsels wise dismiss'd,
6150	The King to aged Nestor took his way:
6150	Him by his tent and dark-ribb'd ship he found
6150	On a soft couch; beside him lay his arms,
6150	His shield, two lances, and a glitt'ring helm:
6150	There lay the rich-wrought belt the old man wore,
6150	When to the battle, arm'd, he led his troops;
6150	For nought to age's weakness would he yield.
6150	Raising his head, and on his elbow propp'd,
6150	"He question'd thus Atrides: ""Who art thou,"
6150	That wand'rest through th' encampment thus alone,
6150	In the dark night, when other mortals sleep?
6150	Seek'st thou some mule broke loose, or comrade lost?
6150	"Speak, nor in silence come; what wouldst thou here?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Agamemnon, King of men:
6150	"""O Nestor! son of Neleus, pride of Greece,"
6150	Know me for Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
6150	On whom hath Jove, beyond the lot of men,
6150	Laid grief that ne'er shall end, while I retain
6150	Breath in my lungs, and vigour in my limbs.
6150	I wander thus, because these eyes of mine
6150	Sweet slumber visits not, by cares of war
6150	Oppress'd, and harass'd by the woes of Greece.
6150	Much for the Greeks I fear; nor keeps my mind
6150	Its wonted firmess; I am ill at ease;
6150	And leaps my troubled heart as tho' 'twould burst
6150	My bosom's bounds; my limbs beneath me shake.
6150	But if thou wilt, since thou too know'st not sleep,
6150	Together to the outposts let us go,
6150	And see if there, by toil and sleep o'erpow'r'd,
6150	The guard repose, neglectful of their watch.
6150	The foe is close at hand; nor are we sure
6150	"He may not hazard e'en a night attack."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied;
6150	"""Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6150	Not all the hopes that Hector entertains
6150	Shall by the Lord of counsel be fulfill'd;
6150	For him are toil and danger yet in store,
6150	If but Achilles of his wrath repent.
6150	Gladly will I attend thee; others too,
6150	Tydides, spearman bold, Ulysses sage,
6150	Ajax the swift, and Phyleus' noble son,
6150	Should all be summon'd; and 'twere well that one
6150	Across the camp should run, to call in haste
6150	The godlike Ajax, and Idomeneus;
6150	Theirs are the farthest ships, nor near at hand.
6150	But, dear to me as Menelaus is,
6150	And highly honour'd, I must blame, that thus
6150	(Though thou shouldst take offence, I needs must say)
6150	He sleeps, and leaves the toil to thee alone.
6150	With all the chiefs he should be busied now,
6150	"Imploring aid, in this our utmost need."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Agamemnon, King of men:
6150	"""For other times, old man, reserve thy blame;"
6150	Sometimes, I own, he lags behind, nor takes
6150	His share of labour; not from indolence,
6150	Or want of sense; but still regarding me;
6150	Waiting from me an impulse to receive.
6150	But now, before me he was up, and came
6150	To visit me; and I have sent him on
6150	To call those very men whom thou hast nam'd.
6150	Come then; for we, beside the gates, and guard
6150	"Shall find them; there my orders were to meet."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied;
6150	"""Then none can blame him; nor can any Greek"
6150	"Justly refuse his summons to obey."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and round his body wrapped his vest;
6150	Then on his feet his sandals fair he bound,
6150	And o'er his shoulders clasp'd a purple cloak,
6150	Doubled, with ample folds, and downy pile;
6150	Then took his spear, with point of sharpen'd brass,
6150	And through the camp prepar'd to take his way.
6150	Gerenian Nestor from his slumbers first
6150	Ulysses, sage as Jove in council, rous'd,
6150	Loud shouting; soon the voice his senses reach'd;
6150	Forth from his tent he came, and thus he spoke:
6150	"""What cause so urgent leads you, through the camp,"
6150	"In the dark night to wander thus alone?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
6150	"""Ulysses sage, Laertes' godlike son,"
6150	Be not offended; such the stress that now
6150	Weighs down our army; come thou then with us,
6150	And others let us call; with whom 'tis meet
6150	"That we should counsel take, to fight or fly."""
6150	""
6150	He said; Ulysses to the tent return'd;
6150	Then, his broad shield across his shoulders thrown,
6150	Came forth again, and with them took his way.
6150	To Diomed, the son of Tydeus, next
6150	They went; and him they found beside his arms,
6150	Without his tent; his comrades slept around,
6150	Their heads upon their bucklers laid; their spears
6150	Stood upright, on the butts; the burnish'd brass
6150	Like Heav'n's own lightning, flashing far around.
6150	Stretch'd on a wild bull's hide the chief repos'd,
6150	A gay-wrought carpet roll'd beneath his head.
6150	Gerenian Nestor close behind him stood,
6150	And touched him with his foot, and thus in tone
6150	"Reproachful spoke: ""Arouse thee, Tydeus' son!"
6150	Why sleep'st thou thus all night? or know'st thou not
6150	That on the very margin of the plain,
6150	And close beside the ships the Trojans lie,
6150	"And little space between the camps is left?"""
6150	""
6150	Quick rous'd from sleep, thus answer'd Diomed:
6150	"""Beshrew thy heart, old man! no labour seems"
6150	For thee too hard; are there not younger men
6150	To run about the camp, and summon all
6150	"The sev'ral chiefs? thou dost too much, old man."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
6150	"""True, friend, and full of wisdom are thy words;"
6150	Good sons indeed I have, and followers brave
6150	And many, who might well my message bear;
6150	But great is now the stress that lies on Greece;
6150	For on a razor's edge is balanc'd now,
6150	To all the Greeks, the chance of life or death.
6150	Do thou then go (for thou my younger art),
6150	And if thou pity me, thyself arouse
6150	"Ajax the swift, and Phyleus' noble son."""
6150	He said; the warrior round his shoulders threw,
6150	Down reaching to his feet, a lion's hide,
6150	Tawny and dark; and took his pond'rous spear.
6150	He went, arous'd, and with him brought the chiefs.
6150	""
6150	When to the guard they came, not sunk in sleep
6150	Found they the leaders; but on wakeful watch
6150	Intent, and all alert beside their arms.
6150	As round a sheepfold keep their anxious watch
6150	The dogs, who in the neighbouring thicket hear
6150	Some beast, that, bold in search of prey, has come
6150	Down from the mountain; loud the clamours rise
6150	Of men and dogs; all sleep is banish'd thence;
6150	So from their eyes was banish'd sleep, who watch'd
6150	Through that disastrous night; still plainward turning
6150	At ev'ry movement in the Trojan camp.
6150	The old man saw, well-pleas'd; and thus address'd
6150	With cheering words the captains of the guard:
6150	"""Watch ever thus, good youths; nor be surpris'd"
6150	"By slumber, lest the foe a triumph gain."""
6150	""
6150	This said, he cross'd the ditch, and with him went
6150	The Grecian leaders, to the council call'd:
6150	With them, admitted to the conf'rence, went
6150	Meriones, and Nestor's noble son.
6150	The deep-dug ditch they cross'd, and sat them down
6150	Upon an open space, from corpses clear;
6150	Where Hector from the slaughter of the Greeks
6150	Turn'd back, when Ev'ning spread her veil around:
6150	There sat they down, and there the conf'rence held.
6150	Gerenian Nestor first took up the word:
6150	"""O friends! is any here with heart so bold"
6150	Who dares, self-confident, the Trojan camp
6150	To enter? there some straggler he might take,
6150	Or in the camp itself some tidings gain,
6150	What are their secret counsels; if they mean
6150	Here by the ships to hold their ground, or back,
6150	Sated with vict'ry, to the town retire.
6150	This could he learn, and hither scatheless bring
6150	His tidings, high as Heav'n in all men's mouths
6150	Would be his praise, and ample his reward.
6150	For ev'ry captain of a ship should give
6150	A coal-black ewe, and at her foot a lamb,
6150	A prize beyond compare; and high should be
6150	"His place at banquets and at solemn feasts."""
6150	""
6150	He said; but all the chiefs in silence heard;
6150	Then rose the valiant Diomed, and said:
6150	"""Nestor, that heart is mine; I dare alone"
6150	Enter the hostile camp, so close at hand;
6150	Yet were one comrade giv'n me, I should go
6150	With more of comfort, more of confidence.
6150	Where two combine, one before other sees
6150	The better course; and ev'n though one alone
6150	The readiest way discover, yet would be
6150	"His judgment slower, his decision less."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and many chiefs to Diomed
6150	Proffer'd companionship; stood forth at once,
6150	With him to penetrate the Trojan camp,
6150	The two Ajaces, ministers of Mars;
6150	Stood forth Meriones, and eagerly
6150	Stood forth the son of Nestor; Atreus' son,
6150	The royal Menelaus, spearman bold,
6150	And stout Ulysses, whose enduring heart
6150	For ev'ry deed of valour was prepar'd.
6150	Rose Agamemnon, King of men, and said:
6150	"""Tydides, comrade dearest to my soul,"
6150	Choose thou thine own companion, whom thou wilt;
6150	Of all the many here that proffer aid
6150	Him whom thou deem'st the best; nor from respect
6150	To persons leave the better man behind,
6150	And take the worse; nor def'rence show to rank,
6150	"Not though the purest royal blood were his."""
6150	""
6150	In fear for Menelaus thus he spoke:
6150	Then answer'd valiant Diomed, and said;
6150	"""If my companion I may freely choose,"
6150	How can I pass the sage Ulysses by?
6150	Of ready wit, and dauntless courage, prov'd
6150	In ev'ry danger; and to Pallas dear.
6150	I should not fear, by him accompanied,
6150	To pass through fire, and safely both return;
6150	"So far in prudence he surpasses all."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Ulysses, stout of heart:
6150	"""Tydides, nor exaggerated praise"
6150	Bestow on me, nor censure; for thou speak'st
6150	To those who know me all for what I am.
6150	But go we; night wanes fast, the morn is near:
6150	The stars are high in Heav'n; and of the night
6150	"Two thirds are spent, one third alone remains."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and both prepar'd to don their arms.
6150	The youthful warrior Thrasymedes gave
6150	To Diomed a two-edg'd sword (his own
6150	Had in the ship been left) and ample shield;
6150	Then on his brows a leathern headpiece plac'd,
6150	Without or peak or plume; a simple casque,
6150	Such as is worn by youths to guard their head.
6150	A bow, and well-fill'd quiver, and a sword,
6150	Meriones to sage Ulysses gave;
6150	And on his brows a leathern headpiece plac'd,
6150	Well wrought within, with num'rous straps secur'd,
6150	And on th' outside, with wild boars' gleaming tusks
6150	Profusely garnish'd, scatter'd here and there
6150	By skilful hand; the midst with felt was lin'd;
6150	This from Amyntor, son of Ormenus,
6150	Autolycus from Eleon bore away,
6150	Spoil of his pillag'd house; Autolycus
6150	Gave to Amphidamas, Cytheran chief,
6150	Who in Scandea dwelt; Amphidamas
6150	To Molus, pledge of friendship; he again
6150	Gave to his son, Meriones, from whom
6150	It now encircled sage Ulysses' brow.
6150	Thus with accoutrements and arms supplied,
6150	They left their brother chiefs, and took their way.
6150	Then close beside their path, by Pallas sent,
6150	Rose, on the right, a heron; through the gloom
6150	They saw it not indeed, but heard the cry.
6150	The fav'ring sign with joy Ulysses hail'd,
6150	"And thus to Pallas pray'd: ""Hear me, thou child"
6150	Of aegis-bearing Jove, who still hast stood
6150	In ev'ry peril at my side, whose eye
6150	My ev'ry movement sees; now, Goddess, now
6150	Befriend me; grant that safe, with triumph crown'd,
6150	We may return, some great exploit achiev'd,
6150	"Such as the Trojans long may bear in mind."""
6150	""
6150	Him following, thus the brave Tydides pray'd:
6150	"""My voice too, child of Jove, undaunted, hear;"
6150	And be with me, as with my father erst,
6150	The godlike Tydeus, when to Thebes he went,
6150	An envoy, in advance; and left behind,
6150	Upon Asopus' banks the mail-clad Greeks.
6150	Smooth was the message which to Thebes he bore;
6150	But great, his mission ended, were the deeds
6150	That with thine aid he wrought; for, Goddess, thou
6150	Wast with him, and thine arm was his defence:
6150	So be thou now with me, and me defend.
6150	Then on thine altar will I sacrifice
6150	A yearling heifer, broad of brow, untam'd,
6150	Whereon no yoke hath mortal ever laid:
6150	"Her will I give, and tip her horns with gold."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as they pray'd, their pray'r the Goddess heard;
6150	Then, their devotions ended, on they far'd
6150	Through the deep dead of night, like lions twain,
6150	'Mid slaughter, corpses, arms, and blacken'd gore.
6150	""
6150	Nor, in the Trojan camp, did Hector leave
6150	The chiefs to rest; but all to conf'rence call'd,
6150	The leaders and the councillors of Troy;
6150	To whom his prudent speech he thus address'd:
6150	"""Who is there here, that for a rich reward"
6150	A noble work will undertake? A car
6150	And two strong-collar'd horses, best of all
6150	That can be found within the Grecian lines,
6150	Shall he receive, who, to his endless praise,
6150	Shall dare approach the ships; and learn if still
6150	They keep their wonted watch, or, by our arms
6150	Subdued and vanquished, meditate retreat,
6150	"And, worn with toil, the nightly watch neglect."""
6150	Thus Hector spoke; but all in silence heard.
6150	""
6150	There was one Dolon in the Trojan camp,
6150	The herald's son, Eumedes; rich in gold
6150	And brass; not fair of face, but swift of foot;
6150	Amid five sisters he the only son;
6150	Who thus to Hector and the Trojans spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, with dauntless courage I will dare"
6150	Approach the ships, and bring thee tidings sure;
6150	But hold thou forth thy royal staff, and swear
6150	That I the horses and the brass-bound car
6150	Shall have, the boast of Peleus' matchless son:
6150	Not vain shall be my errand, nor deceive
6150	Thy hopes; right through the camp I mean to pass
6150	To Agamemnon's tent, where all the chiefs
6150	"Debate in council, or to fight or fly."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and Hector took his royal staff,
6150	"And swore to him: ""Be witness Jove himself,"
6150	The Lord of thunder, that no Trojan man,
6150	Thyself except, shall e'er those horses drive;
6150	"For thee they are reserv'd, a glorious prize."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Hector swore; though unfulfill'd the oath.
6150	The hope to Dolon fresh assurance gave.
6150	Forthwith, his bow across his shoulders slung,
6150	A grisly wolf-skin o'er it, on his head
6150	A cap of marten's fur, and in his hand
6150	A jav'lin, from the camp he took his way,
6150	Straight to the Grecian ships; but never thence
6150	Destin'd to bring th' expected tidings back.
6150	""
6150	The crowd of men and horses left behind,
6150	Briskly he mov'd along; Ulysses first
6150	Mark'd his approach, and to Tydides said:
6150	"""See, from the camp where some one this way comes,"
6150	With what intent I know not; if to play
6150	The spy about the ships, or rob the dead.
6150	Turn we aside, and let him pass us by
6150	A little way; we then with sudden rush
6150	May seize him; or if he outstrip us both
6150	By speed of foot, may urge him tow'rd the ships,
6150	Driving him still before us with our spears,
6150	"And from, the city cutting off his flight."""
6150	Thus saying, 'mid the dead, beside the road
6150	They crouch'd; he, all unconscious, hasten'd by.
6150	But when such space was interpos'd as leave
6150	Between the sluggish oxen and themselves                        [3]
6150	A team of mules (so much the faster they
6150	Through the stiff fallow drag the jointed plough),
6150	They rush'd upon him; at the sound he stopp'd,
6150	Deeming that from the Trojan camp they came,
6150	By Hector sent, to order his return.
6150	Within a spear's length when they came, or less,
6150	For foes he knew them, and to night address'd
6150	His active limbs; they rush'd in hot pursuit.
6150	And as two hounds, well practis'd in the chase,
6150	With glist'ning fangs, unflagging, strain to catch,
6150	In woodland glade, some pricket deer, or hare,
6150	That flies before them, screaming; so those two,
6150	Tydides and Ulysses, stout of heart,
6150	With fiery zeal, unflagging, strain'd to catch
6150	The flying Dolon, from the camp cut off;
6150	But when the fugitive approach'd the ships,
6150	Close by the guard, fresh vigour Pallas gave
6150	To Diomed, lest haply from the walls
6150	Some other might anticipate his blow,
6150	And he himself but second honours gain.
6150	Tydides then with threat'ning gesture cried,
6150	"""Stop, or I hurl my spear; and small thy chance,"
6150	"If I assail thee, of escape from death."""
6150	He said, and threw his spear; but by design
6150	It struck him not; above his shoulder flew
6150	The polish'd lance, and quiver'd in the ground.
6150	Sudden he stopp'd, with panic paralys'd:
6150	His teeth all chatt'ring, pale with fear he stood,
6150	With falt'ring accents; panting, they came up
6150	And seiz'd him in their grasp; he thus, in tears:
6150	"""Spare but my life; my life I can redeem;"
6150	For ample stores I have of gold, and brass,
6150	And well-wrought iron; and of these my sire
6150	Would pay a gen'rous ransom, could he learn
6150	"That in the Grecian ships I yet surviv'd."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Ulysses, deep-designing, thus:
6150	"""Be of good cheer; nor let the fear of death"
6150	Disturb thy mind; but tell me truly this;
6150	How is 't that tow'rd the ships thou com'st alone,
6150	In the still night, when other mortals sleep?
6150	Com'st thou perchance for plunder of the dead?
6150	Or seek'st upon our ships to play the spy,
6150	"By Hector sent? or of thine own accord?"""
6150	""
6150	Then Dolon thus--his knees with terror shook--
6150	"""With much persuasion, of my better mind"
6150	Hector beguil'd me, off'ring as my prize
6150	Achilles' horses and his brass-bound car;
6150	Through the dark night he sent me, and enjoin'd,
6150	Ent'ring your hostile camp, to learn if still
6150	Ye keep your wonted watch, or by our arms
6150	Subdued and vanquish'd, meditate retreat,
6150	"And worn with toil, your nightly watch neglect."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Ulysses thus with scornful smile:
6150	"""High soar'd thy hopes indeed, that thought to win"
6150	The horses of Achilles; hard are they
6150	For mortal man to harness or control,
6150	Save for Achilles' self, the Goddess-born.
6150	But tell me truly this; when here thou cam'st,
6150	Where left'st thou Hector, guardian chief of Troy?
6150	Where are his warlike arms? his horses where?
6150	Where lie the rest? and where are plac'd their guards?
6150	What are their secret counsels? do they mean
6150	Here by the ships to keep their ground, or back,
6150	"Sated with vict'ry, to the town return?"""
6150	""
6150	Whom Dolon answer'd thus, Eumedes' son:
6150	"""Thy questions all true answers shall receive;"
6150	Hector, with those who share his counsels, sits
6150	In conf'rence, far apart, near Ilus' tomb;
6150	But for the guards thou speak'st of, noble chief,
6150	Not one is station'd to protect the camp.
6150	Around the Trojan fires indeed, perforce,
6150	A watch is kept; and they, among themselves,
6150	Due caution exercise: but, for th' Allies,
6150	They sleep, and to the Trojans leave the watch,
6150	"Since nor their children nor their wives are near."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer sage Ulysses thus:
6150	"""Say now, where sleep they? with the Trojans mix'd,"
6150	"Or separate? explain, that I may know."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd Dolon thus, Eumedes' son:
6150	"""To this too will I give ye answer true;"
6150	Next to the sea the Carian forces lie;
6150	The Paeon archers and the Leleges,
6150	The Caucons, and the bold Pelasgians next;
6150	On Thymbra's side the Lycians' lot has fall'n,
6150	The Mysians brave, the Phrygian cavalry,
6150	And the Maeonians with their horsehair plumes.
6150	But why of these enquire? if ye intend
6150	An inroad on the camp, apart from all,
6150	New come, the farthest off, the Thracians lie:
6150	Rhesus their King, the son of Eioneus,
6150	Sleeps in the midst; no steeds that e'er I saw
6150	For size and beauty can with his compare:
6150	Whiter than snow, and swifter than the wind.
6150	With gold and silver is his chariot wrought,
6150	His armour golden, of gigantic size,
6150	A marvel to behold! it seems not meet
6150	For mortal man, but for th' immortal Gods.
6150	But take me now in safety to the ships;
6150	Or leave me here in fetters bound, that so,
6150	Ere ye return, ye may approve my words,
6150	"And see if I have told you true, or no."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Diomed with stern regard:
6150	"""Dolon, though good thy tidings, hope not thou,"
6150	Once in our hands, to 'scape the doom of death;
6150	For if we now should let thee go, again
6150	In after times thou mightst our ships approach,
6150	As secret spy, or open enemy:
6150	But if beneath my hands thou lose thy life,
6150	"No farther trouble shalt thou cause the Greeks."""
6150	He said; and as the suppliant sought in vain
6150	To touch his beard, imploring, through his throat,
6150	Both tendons sev'ring, drove his trenchant blade:
6150	Ev'n while he spoke, his head was roll'd in dust.
6150	The cap of marten fur from off his head
6150	They took, the wolf-skin, and the bow unstrung,
6150	And jav'lin; these Ulysses held aloft,
6150	And thus to Pallas pray'd, who gave the spoil:
6150	"""Receive, great Goddess, these our gifts; to thee,"
6150	Of all th' Immortals on Olympus' height,
6150	Our off'rings first we give; conduct us now,
6150	"The Thracian camp and Thracian steeds to gain."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, amid the tamarisk scrub
6150	Far off he threw the trophies; then with reeds,
6150	And twigs new broken from the tamarisk boughs,
6150	He set a mark, lest in the gloom of night
6150	Returning, they might haply miss the spot.
6150	Then on they pass'd thro' arms and blacken'd gore,
6150	And reach'd the confines of the Thracian camp.
6150	There found they all by sleep subdued; their arms
6150	Beside them on the ground, in order due,
6150	In triple rows; and by the side of each,
6150	Harness'd and yok'd, his horses ready stood.
6150	Surrounded by his warriors, Rhesus slept;
6150	Beside him stood his coursers fleet, their reins
6150	Suspended to the chariot's topmost rail:
6150	Ulysses mark'd him as he lay, and said,
6150	"""This is the man, Tydides, these the steeds,"
6150	To us by Dolon, whom we slew, describ'd.
6150	Now then, put forth thy might; beseems it not
6150	To stand thus idly with thine arms in hand:
6150	Loose thou the horses; or do thou the men
6150	"Despatch, and to my care the horses leave."""
6150	""
6150	He said: and Pallas vigour new inspir'd,
6150	That right and left he smote; dire were the groans
6150	Of slaughter'd men; the earth was red with blood;
6150	And as a lion on th' untended flock
6150	Of sheep or goats with savage onslaught springs,
6150	Ev'n so Tydides on the Thracians sprang,
6150	Till twelve were slain; and as Tydides' sword
6150	Gave each to death, Ulysses by the feet
6150	Drew each aside; reflecting, that perchance
6150	The horses, startled, might refuse to pass
6150	The corpses; for as yet they knew them not.
6150	But when Tydides saw the sleeping King,
6150	A thirteenth victim to his sword was giv'n,
6150	Painfully breathing; for by Pallas' art,
6150	He saw that night, as in an evil dream,
6150	The son of OEneus standing o'er his head.
6150	Meanwhile Ulysses sage the horses loos'd;
6150	He gather'd up the reins, and with his bow
6150	(For whip was none at hand) he drove them forth;
6150	Then softly whistling to Tydides gave
6150	A signal; he, the while, remain'd behind,
6150	Musing what bolder deed he yet might do;
6150	Whether the seat, whereon the arms were laid,
6150	To draw away, or, lifted high in air,
6150	To bear it off in triumph on the car;
6150	Or on the Thracians farther loss inflict;
6150	But while he mus'd, beside him Pallas stood,
6150	"And said, ""Bethink thee, Tydeus' son, betimes"
6150	Of thy return, lest, if some other God
6150	"Should wake the Trojans, thou shouldst need to fly."""
6150	""
6150	She said; the heav'nly voice he recogniz'd,
6150	And mounted straight the car; Ulysses touch'd
6150	The horses with his bow; and, urg'd to speed,
6150	They tow'rd the ships their rapid course pursued.
6150	""
6150	Nor idle watch Apollo kept, who saw
6150	Tydides o'er the plain by Pallas led;
6150	With anger fill'd, the Trojan camp he sought;
6150	And Rhesus' kinsman, good Hippocoon,
6150	The Thracian councillor, from sleep arous'd;
6150	Awaking, when the vacant space he view'd,
6150	Where late had stood the horses; and his friends
6150	Gasping in death, and welt'ring in their blood,
6150	He groan'd as on his comrade's name he call'd:
6150	Then loud the clamour rose, and wild uproar,
6150	Unspeakable, of Trojans thronging round;
6150	They marvell'd at the deeds; but marvell'd more
6150	How they who wrought them had escap'd unscath'd.
6150	""
6150	Meantime arriv'd where Hector's scout they slew,
6150	Ulysses, lov'd of Heav'n, a moment check'd
6150	His eager steeds; Tydides from the car
6150	Leap'd to the ground, and in Ulysses' hand
6150	The bloody trophies plac'd; then mounted quick,
6150	And tow'rd the ships, their destin'd goal, urg'd on
6150	The fiery horses; nothing loth, they flew.
6150	"Nestor first heard the sound, and cried, ""O friends,"
6150	The leaders and the councillors of Greece,
6150	Am I deceiv'd, or is it true? methinks
6150	The sound of horses, hurrying, strikes mine ear;
6150	Grant Heav'n, Ulysses and brave Diomed
6150	May bring those horses from the Trojan camp;
6150	Yet much I fear our bravest may have met
6150	"With some disaster 'mid the crowd of foes."""
6150	""
6150	He scarce had ended, when themselves appear'd,
6150	And from the car descended: welcom'd back
6150	With cordial grasp of hands, and friendly words.
6150	Gerenian Nestor first, enquiring, said:
6150	"""Tell me, renown'd Ulysses, pride of Greece,"
6150	Whence come these horses? from the Trojan camp?
6150	Or hath some God, that met you by the way,
6150	Bestow'd them, radiant as the beams of light?
6150	Among the Trojans day by day I move;
6150	'Tis not my wont; old warrior though I be,
6150	To lag behind; but horses such as these
6150	I never saw; some God hath giv'n them, sure;
6150	For Jove, the Cloud-compeller, loves you both,
6150	"And Pallas, child of aegis-bearing Jove."""
6150	""
6150	To whom again the sage Ulysses thus:
6150	"""O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece,"
6150	Had they so will'd, the Gods, so great their pow'r,
6150	E'en better horses could have giv'n than these;
6150	But these, old man, are Thracians, newly come;
6150	Whose King the valiant Diomed hath slain,
6150	And with him twelve, the best of all his band.
6150	A scout too have we slain, by Hector sent,
6150	"And by the Trojan chiefs, to spy our camp."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and o'er the ditch the horses drove,
6150	Exulting in their prize; and with him went
6150	The other chiefs, rejoicing, through the camp.
6150	Arriv'd at Diomed's well-order'd tent,
6150	First with strong halters to the rack, where stood,
6150	High-fed with corn, his own swift-footed steeds,
6150	The horses they secur'd; Ulysses then
6150	The bloody spoils of Dolon stow'd away
6150	In the ship's stern, till fitting sacrifice
6150	To Pallas might be offer'd; to the sea
6150	Descending then, they wash'd away the sweat,
6150	Which on their necks, and thighs, and knees had dried;
6150	The sweat wash'd off, and in the ocean waves
6150	Themselves refresh'd, they sought the polish'd bath;
6150	Then, by the bath restor'd, and all their limbs
6150	Anointed freely with the lissom oil,
6150	Sat down to breakfast; and from flowing bowls
6150	In Pallas' honour pour'd the luscious wine.

6150	ARGUMENT.
6150	""
6150	THE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector
6150	prepares the Trojans to receive them; while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva,
6150	give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him; and Hector is
6150	commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the
6150	engagement, till the king should be wounded, and retire from the field.
6150	He then makes a great slaughter of the enemy; Ulysses and Diomed put a
6150	stop to him for a time; but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is
6150	obliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans,
6150	wounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him.
6150	Hector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes and
6150	rallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the
6150	army, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in
6150	Nestor's chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship)
6150	sends Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that
6150	manner. Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the
6150	accidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he
6150	had remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to
6150	fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it clad in
6150	Achilles' armour. Patroclus in his return meets Eurypylus also wounded,
6150	and assists in that distress.
6150	""
6150	This book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem; and the
6150	same day, with its various actions and adventures, is extended through
6150	the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth,

6150	""
6150	Now rose Aurora from Tithonus' bed,
6150	To mortals and Immortals bringing light;
6150	When to the ships of Greece came Discord down,
6150	Despatch'd from Jove, with dire portents of war.
6150	Upon Ulysses' lofty ship she stood,
6150	The midmost, thence to shout to either side,
6150	Or to the tents of Ajax Telamon,
6150	Or of Achilles, who at each extreme,
6150	Confiding in their strength, had moor'd their ships.
6150	There stood the Goddess, and in accents loud
6150	And dread she call'd, and fix'd in ev'ry breast
6150	The fierce resolve to wage unwearied war;
6150	And dearer to their hearts than thoughts of home
6150	Or wish'd return, became the battle-field.
6150	""
6150	Atrides, loudly shouting, call'd the Greeks
6150	To arms: himself his flashing armour donn'd.
6150	First on his legs the well-wrought greaves he fix'd,
6150	Fasten'd with silver clasps; his ample chest
6150	A breastplate guarded, giv'n by Cinyras
6150	In pledge of friendship; for in Cyprus' isle
6150	He heard the rumour of the glorious fleet
6150	About to sail for Troy; and sought with gifts
6150	To win the favour of the mighty King.
6150	Ten bands were there inwrought of dusky bronze,
6150	Twelve of pure gold, twice ten of shining tin:
6150	Of bronze six dragons upwards tow'rds the neck
6150	Their length extended, three on either side:
6150	In colour like the bow, which Saturn's son
6150	Plac'd in the clouds, a sign to mortal men:
6150	Then o'er his shoulder threw his sword; bright flash'd
6150	The golden studs; the silver scabbard shone,
6150	With golden baldrick fitted; next his shield
6150	He took, full-siz'd, well-wrought, well-prov'd in fight;
6150	Around it ran ten circling rims of brass;
6150	With twenty bosses round of burnish'd tin,
6150	And, in the centre, one of dusky bronze.
6150	A Gorgon's head, with aspect terrible,
6150	Was wrought, with Fear and Flight encircled round:
6150	Depending from a silver belt it hung;
6150	And on the belt a dragon, wrought in bronze,
6150	Twin'd his lithe folds, and turn'd on ev'ry side,
6150	Sprung from a single neck, his triple head.
6150	Then on his brow his lofty helm he plac'd,
6150	Four-crested, double-peak'd, with horsehair plumes,
6150	That nodded,-fearful, from the warrior's head.
6150	Then took two weighty lances, tipp'd with brass,
6150	Which fiercely flash'd against the face of Heav'n:
6150	Pallas and Juno thund'ring from on high
6150	In honour of Mycenae's wealthy lord.
6150	""
6150	Forthwith they order'd, each his charioteer,
6150	To stay his car beside the ditch; themselves,
6150	On foot, in arms accoutred, sallied forth,
6150	And loud, ere early dawn, the clamour rose.
6150	Advanc'd before the cars, they lin'd the ditch;
6150	Follow'd the cars, a little space between:
6150	But Jove with dire confusion fill'd their ranks,
6150	Who sent from Heav'n a show'r of blood-stain'd rain.
6150	In sign of many a warrior's coming doom,
6150	Soon to the viewless shades untimely sent.
6150	Meanwhile upon the slope, beneath the plain,
6150	The Trojan chiefs were gather'd; Hector's self,
6150	Polydamas, AEneas, as a God
6150	In rev'rence held; Antenor's three brave sons,
6150	Agenor's godlike presence, Polybus,
6150	And, heav'nly fair, the youthful Acamas.
6150	In front was seen the broad circumference
6150	Of Hector's shield; and as amid the clouds
6150	Shines forth the fiery dog-star, bright and clear,
6150	Anon beneath the cloudy veil conceal'd;
6150	So now in front was Hector seen, and now
6150	Pass'd to the rear, exhorting; all in brass,
6150	His burnish'd arms like Jove's own lightning flash'd.
6150	""
6150	As in the corn-land of some wealthy Lord
6150	The rival bands of reapers mow the swathe,
6150	Barley or wheat; and fast the trusses fall;
6150	So Greeks and Trojans mow'd th' opposing ranks;
6150	Nor these admitted thought of faint retreat,
6150	But still made even head; while those, like wolves,
6150	Rush'd to the onset; Discord, Goddess dire,
6150	Beheld, rejoicing; of the heav'nly pow'rs
6150	She only mingled with the combatants;
6150	The others all were absent; they, serene,
6150	Repos'd in gorgeous palaces, for each
6150	Amid Olympus' deep recesses built.
6150	Yet all the cloud-girt son of Saturn blam'd,
6150	Who will'd the vict'ry to the arms of Troy.
6150	He heeded not their anger; but withdrawn
6150	Apart from all, in pride of conscious strength,
6150	Survey'd the walls of Troy, the ships of Greece,
6150	The flash of arms, the slayers and the slain.
6150	""
6150	While yet 'twas morn, and wax'd the youthful day,
6150	Thick flew the shafts, and fast the people fell
6150	On either side: but when the hour was come
6150	When woodmen, in the forest's deep recess,
6150	Prepare their food, and wearied with the toil
6150	Of felling loftiest trees, with aching arms
6150	Turn with keen relish to their midday meal;
6150	Then Grecian valour broke th' opposing ranks,
6150	As each along the line encourag'd each;
6150	First sprang the monarch Agamemnon forth,
6150	And brave Bienor slew, his people's guard;
6150	And, with the chief, his friend and charioteer,
6150	Oileus; he, down-leaping from the car,
6150	Stood forth defiant; but between his brows
6150	The monarch's spear was thrust; nor aught avail'd
6150	The brass-bound helm, to stay the weapon's point;
6150	Through helm and bone it pass'd, and all the brain
6150	Was shatter'd; forward as he rush'd, he fell.
6150	Them left he there, their bare breasts gleaming white,
6150	Stripp'd of their arms; and hasten'd in pursuit
6150	Of Antiphus and Isus, Priam's sons,
6150	A bastard one, and one legitimate,
6150	Both on one car; the bastard held the reins:
6150	Beside him stood the gallant Antiphus.
6150	Them, as they fed their flocks on Ida's heights,
6150	Achilles once had captive made, and bound
6150	With willow saplings, till for ransom freed.
6150	The mighty monarch, Agamemnon, drove
6150	Through Isus' breast his spear; his weighty sword
6150	Descended on the head of Antiphus
6150	Beside the ear, and hurl'd him from his car;
6150	These of their armour he despoil'd in haste,
6150	Known to him both; for he had seen them oft
6150	Beside the ships, when thither captive brought
6150	From Ida by Achilles, swift of foot.
6150	As when a lion in their lair hath seiz'd
6150	The helpless offspring of a mountain doe,
6150	And breaks their bones with ease, and with strong teeth
6150	Crushes their tender life; nor can their dam,
6150	Though close at hand she be, avail them aught;
6150	For she herself by deadly terror seiz'd,
6150	Through the thick coppice and the forest flies,
6150	Panting, and bath'd in sweat, the monster's rush;
6150	So dar'd no Trojan give those brethren aid,
6150	Themselves in terror of the warlike Greeks.
6150	Peisander next, and bold Hippolochus,
6150	Sons of Antimachus ('twas he who chief,
6150	Seduc'd by Paris' gold and splendid gifts,
6150	Advis'd the restitution to refuse
6150	Of Helen to her Lord), the King assail'd;
6150	Both on one car; but from their hands had dropp'd
6150	The broider'd reins; bewilder'd there they stood;
6150	While, with a lion's bound, upon them sprang
6150	The son of Atreus; suppliant, in the car,
6150	"They clasp'd his knees; ""Give quarter, Atreus' son,"
6150	Redeem our lives; our sire Antimachus
6150	Possesses goodly store of brass and gold,
6150	And well-wrought iron; and of these he fain
6150	Would pay a noble ransom, could he hear
6150	"That in the Grecian ships we yet surviv'd."""
6150	""
6150	Thus they, with gentle words, and tears, imploring;
6150	But all ungentle was the voice they heard
6150	"In answer; ""If indeed ye be the sons"
6150	Of that Antimachus, who counsel gave,
6150	When noble Menelaus came to Troy
6150	With sage Ulysses, as ambassadors,
6150	To slay them both, nor suffer their return,
6150	"Pay now the forfeit of your father's guilt."""
6150	He said, and with a spear-thrust through his breast
6150	Peisander dash'd to earth; backward he fell.
6150	Down leap'd Hippolochus; but Atreus' son
6150	Severing his hands and neck, amid the throng
6150	Sent whirling like a bowl the gory head.
6150	These left he there; and where the thickest throng
6150	Maintain'd the tug of war, thither he flew,
6150	And with him eager hosts of well-greav'd Greeks.
6150	Soon on the Trojans' flight enforc'd they hung,
6150	Destroying; foot on foot, and horse on horse;
6150	While from the plain thick clouds of dust arose
6150	Beneath the armed hoofs of clatt'ring steeds;
6150	And on the monarch Agamemnon press'd,
6150	Still slaying, urging still the Greeks to arms.
6150	As when amid a densely timber'd wood
6150	Light the devouring flames, by eddying winds
6150	Hither and thither borne, fast falls the copse
6150	Prostrate beneath the fire's impetuous course;
6150	So thickly fell the flying Trojans' heads
6150	Beneath the might of Agamemnon's arm;
6150	And here and there, athwart the pass of war,
6150	Was many an empty car at random whirl'd
6150	By strong-neck'd steeds, of guiding hands bereft;
6150	Stretch'd on the plain they lay, more welcome sight
6150	To carrion birds than to their widow'd wives.
6150	But Hector, from the fray and din of war,
6150	And dust, and blood, and carnage, Jove withdrew.
6150	Still on Atrides press'd, the Greek pursuit
6150	With eager shouts exciting; past the tomb
6150	Of Ilus, ancient son of Dardanus,
6150	And tow'rd the fig-tree, midway o'er the plain,
6150	Straining to gain the town, the Trojans fled;
6150	While loudly shouting, his unconquer'd hands
6150	With carnage dyed, Atrides urg'd their flight.
6150	But when the Scaean gates and oak were reach'd,
6150	They made a stand, and fac'd the foe's assault.
6150	Some o'er the open plain were yet dispers'd;
6150	As heifers, by a lion scatter'd wide,
6150	At dead of night; all fly; on one descends
6150	The doom of death; her with his pow'rful teeth
6150	He seizes, and, her neck first broken, rends,
6150	And on her entrails gorging, laps her blood.
6150	So these the monarch Agamemnon chas'd,
6150	Slaying the hindmost; they in terror fled:
6150	Some headlong, backward some, Atrides' hand
6150	Hurl'd from their chariot many a warrior bold;
6150	So forward and so fierce he bore his spear.
6150	But as he near'd the city, and stood beneath
6150	The lofty wall, the Sire of Gods and men
6150	From Heav'n descended; on the topmost height
6150	Of Ida's spring-abounding hill he sat:
6150	And while his hand the lightning grasp'd, he thus
6150	To golden-winged Iris gave command:
6150	""
6150	"""Haste thee, swift Iris, and to Hector bear"
6150	From me this message; bid him, that as long
6150	As Agamemnon in the van appears,
6150	Raging, and dealing death among the ranks,
6150	He from the battle keep himself aloof,
6150	But urge the rest undaunted to maintain
6150	The stubborn fight; but should Atrides, struck
6150	By spear or arrow, to his car withdraw,
6150	He shall from me receive such pow'r to slay,
6150	As to the ships shall bear him, ere the sun
6150	"Decline, and Darkness spread her hallowing shade."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; to Troy, obedient to his word,
6150	From Ida's heights swift-footed Iris sped:
6150	Amid the horses and the well-fram'd cars
6150	The godlike Hector, Priam's son, she found,
6150	And stood beside him, and address'd him thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, thou son of Priam, sage as Jove"
6150	In council, he the Universal Lord
6150	Sends thee by me this message; that as long
6150	As Agamemnon in the van appears,
6150	Raging, and dealing death amid the ranks,
6150	Thou from the battle keep thyself aloof,
6150	But urge the rest undaunted to maintain
6150	The stubborn fight; but should Atrides, struck
6150	By spear or arrow, to his car withdraw,
6150	Thou shalt from him receive such pow'r to slay
6150	As to the ships shall bear thee, ere the sun
6150	"Decline, and Darkness spread her hallowing shade."""
6150	""
6150	Swift-footed Iris said, and disappear'd;
6150	But from his chariot Hector leap'd to earth,
6150	Hither and thither passing through the ranks,
6150	With brandish'd jav'lins urging to the fight.
6150	Loud, at his bidding, rose the battle-cry;
6150	Back roll'd the tide; again they fac'd the Greeks:
6150	On th' other side the Greeks their masses form'd,
6150	In line of battle rang'd; opposed they stood;
6150	And in the front, to none content to cede
6150	The foremost place, was Agamemnon seen.
6150	""
6150	Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell,
6150	Of all the Trojans and their fam'd Allies,
6150	Who first oppos'd to Agamemnon stood.
6150	Iphidamas, Antenor's gallant son,
6150	Stalwart and brave; in fertile Thracia bred,
6150	Mother of flocks; him, in his infant years,
6150	His grandsire Cisseus, fair Theano's sire,
6150	In his own palace rear'd; and when he reach'd
6150	The perfect measure of his glorious youth,
6150	Still in his house retain'd him, and to wife
6150	Gave him his daughter; but when tidings came
6150	Of Grecian warfare, from the marriage straight
6150	Embarking, with twelve beaked ships he sailed,
6150	That owned his sway; these on Percote's shore
6150	He left; and came himself on foot to Troy;
6150	Who now confronted Atreus' godlike son.
6150	""
6150	When near they drew, Atrides miss'd his aim,
6150	His spear diverging; then Iphidamas
6150	Beneath the breastplate, striking on his belt,
6150	Strove with strong hand to drive the weapon home:
6150	Yet could not pierce the belt's close-plaited work;
6150	The point, encounter'd by the silver fold,
6150	Was bent, like lead; then with his pow'rful hand
6150	The monarch Agamemnon seiz'd the spear,
6150	And tow'rd him drew, and with a lion's strength
6150	Wrench'd from his foeman's grasp; then on his neck
6150	Let fall his sword, and slack'd his limbs in death.
6150	There, falling in his country's cause, he slept
6150	The iron sleep of death; unhappy he,
6150	Far from his virgin-bride, yet unpossess'd,
6150	Though bought with costly presents; first he gave
6150	A hundred steers; and promis'd thousands more
6150	Of sheep and goats from out his countless flocks.
6150	Him Agamemnon of his arms despoil'd,
6150	And to the crowd of Greeks the trophies bore.
6150	But when Antenor's eldest-born beheld,
6150	Coon, th' observ'd of all men, bitt'rest grief
6150	His eyes o'ershadow'd, for his brother's fate;
6150	And, unperceiv'd by Atreus' godlike son,
6150	Standing aside, he struck him with his spear,
6150	Through the mid arm, beneath the elbow's bend;
6150	And drove right through the weapon's glitt'ring point.
6150	Writh'd with the pain the mighty King of men;
6150	Yet from the combat flinch'd he not, nor quail'd:
6150	But grasping firm his weather-toughen'd spear
6150	On Coon rush'd, as by the feet he drew
6150	His father's son, Iphidamas, away,
6150	Invoking all the bravest to his aid;
6150	And as he drew the body tow'rd the crowd,
6150	Beneath the bossy shield the monarch thrust
6150	His brass-clad spear, and slack'd his limbs in death;
6150	Then near approaching, ev'n upon the corpse
6150	Of dead Iphidamas, struck off his head:
6150	So by Atrides' hand, Antenor's sons,
6150	Their doom accomplish'd, to the shades were sent.
6150	Then through the crowded ranks, with spear and sword,
6150	And massive stones, he held his furious course,
6150	While the hot blood was welling from his arm;
6150	But when the wound was dry, and stanch'd the blood,
6150	Keen anguish then Atrides' might subdued.
6150	As when a woman in her labour-throes
6150	Sharp pangs encompass, by Lucina sent,
6150	Who rules o'er child-birth travail, ev'n so keen
6150	The pangs that then Atrides' might subdued.
6150	Mounting his car he bade his charioteer
6150	Drive to the ships; for sore his spirit was pain'd;
6150	But loud and clear he shouted to the Greeks:
6150	"""O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
6150	Yours be it now our sea-borne ships to guard:
6150	Since Jove, the Lord of counsel, through the day
6150	"Wills not that I the battle should maintain."""
6150	""
6150	He said: and swiftly to the ships were driv'n
6150	His sleek-skinn'd coursers; nothing loth they flew;
6150	With foam their chests were fleck'd, with dust their flanks,
6150	As from the field their wounded Lord they bore:
6150	But Hector, as he saw the King retire,
6150	To Trojans and to Lycians call'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Trojans and Lycians, and ye Dardans fam'd"
6150	In close encounter, quit ye now like men;
6150	Put forth your wonted valour; from the field
6150	Their bravest has withdrawn, and Jove on me
6150	Great glory hath shed; now headlong on the Greeks
6150	"Urge your swift steeds, and endless honour gain."""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh courage rous'd in ev'ry breast:
6150	And as a hunter cheers his sharp-fang'd hounds
6150	On forest boar or lion; on the Greeks
6150	So cheer'd the valiant Trojans Priam's son,
6150	Illustrious Hector, stern as blood-stain'd Mars.
6150	Bent on high deeds, himself in front advanc'd,
6150	Fell on the masses as a whirlwind falls,
6150	Lashing with furious sweep the dark-blue sea.
6150	""
6150	Say then, who first, who last, by Hector's hand,
6150	Whom Jove had will'd to crown with honour, died.
6150	Assaeus first, and then Autonous,
6150	Opites, and Opheltius, Dolops, son
6150	Of Clytus, and AEsumnus, Agelas
6150	And Orus, and brave Hipponous;
6150	All these the chiefs of Greece; the nameless crowd
6150	He scatter'd next; as when the west wind drives
6150	The clouds, and battles with the hurricane,
6150	Before the clearing blast of Notus driv'n;
6150	The big waves heave and roll, and high aloft,
6150	The gale, careering, flings the ocean spray;
6150	So thick and furious fell on hostile heads
6150	The might of Hector. Now had fearful deeds
6150	Been done, and Greeks beside their ships had fall'n
6150	In shameful rout, had not Ulysses thus
6150	To Diomed, the son of Tydeus, call'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Why, son of Tydeus, should we thus relax"
6150	Our warlike courage? come, stand by me now,
6150	True friend! if Hector of the glancing helm
6150	"Our ships should capture, great were our disgrace."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the valiant Diomed:
6150	"""Beside thee will I stand, and still endure;"
6150	But brief will be the term of our success,
6150	Since Jove, the Cloud-compeller, not to us,
6150	"But to the Trojans, wills the victory."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and from his car Thymbraeus hurl'd,
6150	Through the left breast transfix'd: Ulysses' hand
6150	His charioteer, the brave Molion, slew.
6150	These left they there, no more to share the fight;
6150	Then turning, spread confusion 'mid the crowd:
6150	As turn two boars upon the hunter's pack
6150	With desp'rate courage, turning so to bay,
6150	Those two, the Trojans scatt'ring, gave the Greeks,
6150	From Hector flying, time again to breathe.
6150	A car they seiz'd which bore two valiant chiefs,
6150	Sons of Percotian Merops; he, o'er all
6150	In lore prophetic skill'd, would fain at home
6150	Have kept them from the life-destroying war:
6150	But they, by adverse fate impell'd to seek
6150	Their doom of death, his warning voice despis'd.
6150	These two, of strength and life at once bereft,
6150	The son of Tydeus, valiant Diomed,
6150	Stripp'd of their armour; while Ulysses slew
6150	Hippodamus, and bold Hyperochus.
6150	Thus Jove, from Ida's height beholding, held
6150	His even scale, each party slaught'ring each.
6150	Then with his spear Tydides through the loins
6150	Agastrophus, the son of Paeon, smote;
6150	No car had he at hand, whereto to fly:
6150	But, ill-advis'd, had in th' attendants' charge
6150	His horses left far off; while he himself
6150	Rush'd 'mid the throng on foot, and met his doom.
6150	Hector's quick glance athwart the files beheld,
6150	And to the rescue, with a shout, he sprang,
6150	The Trojan columns following; not unmov'd
6150	The valiant Diomed his coming saw,
6150	And thus bespoke Ulysses at his side:
6150	"""On us this plague, this mighty Hector, falls:"
6150	"Yet stand we firm, and boldly meet the shock."""
6150	He said, and, poising, hurl'd his pond'rous spear,
6150	And not in vain; on Hector's head it struck
6150	His helmet's crest, but, brass encount'ring brass,
6150	Himself it reach'd not; for the visor'd helm,
6150	Apollo's gift, three-plated, stay'd its force.
6150	Yet backward Hector sprang amid the crowd,
6150	And on his knees he dropp'd, his stalwart hand
6150	Propp'd on the ground; while darkness veil'd his eyes.
6150	But ere Tydides, following up his spear,
6150	Attain'd from far the spot whereon he fell,
6150	Hector reviv'd, and mounting quick his car,
6150	Drove 'mid the crowd, and 'scap'd the doom of death
6150	Then thus, with threat'ning spear, Tydides cried:
6150	"""Yet once again, vile hound, hast thou escap'd;"
6150	Thy doom was nigh; but thee thy God hath sav'd,
6150	Phoebus, to whom, amid the clash of spears,
6150	Well mayst thou pray! We yet shall meet again;
6150	When I shall end thee, if a guardian God
6150	I too may claim; meanwhile from thee I turn,
6150	"And others seek on whom my hap may light."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and turn'd him of his arms to strip
6150	The son of Paeon; but beside the stone
6150	That mark'd where men of old had rais'd a mound
6150	To Ilus, Dardan's son, the ancient chief,
6150	There crouching, Paris, fair-hair'd Helen's Lord,
6150	Against the son of Tydeus bent his bow.
6150	He from the breast of brave Agastrophus
6150	Had stripp'd the corslet; from his shoulders broad
6150	The buckler, and the helmet from his head,
6150	When Paris bent his bow, and not in vain
6150	His arrow launch'd; Tydides' dexter foot
6150	Right through it pierc'd, and pinn'd it to the ground.
6150	Joyous he laugh'd, and from his hiding place
6150	Sprang forth, and thus in tones of triumph cried:
6150	""
6150	"""Thou hast it! not in vain my shaft hath flown!"
6150	Would that, deep buried in thy flank, it touch'd
6150	Thy very life! so should our Trojans lose
6150	Their panic fear, who now on thee with dread,
6150	"As bleating goats upon a lion, look."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, unmov'd, the valiant Diomed:
6150	"""Poor archer, trusting to thy bow alone,"
6150	Vile sland'rer and seducer! if indeed
6150	Thou durst in arms oppos'd to me to stand,
6150	Nought would avail thy arrows and thy bow:
6150	And now, because thy shaft hath graz'd my foot,
6150	Thou mak'st thine empty boast: I heed thee not,
6150	More than a woman or a puny child:
6150	A worthless coward's weapon hath no point.
6150	'Tis diff'rent far with me! though light it fall,
6150	My spear is sharp, and whom it strikes, it slays.
6150	His widow's cheeks are mark'd with scars of grief,
6150	His children orphans; rotting on the ground,
6150	Red with his blood, he lies, his fun'ral rites
6150	"By carrion birds, and not by women paid."""
6150	""
6150	Thus while he spoke, Ulysses, spearman bold,
6150	Drew near, and stood before him; he, behind,
6150	Sat down protected, and from out his foot
6150	The arrow drew; whereat sharp anguish shot
6150	Through all his flesh; and mounting on his car
6150	He bade his faithful charioteer in haste
6150	Drive to the ships, for pain weigh'd down his soul.
6150	Alone Ulysses stood; of all the Greeks
6150	Not one beside him; all were panic-struck:
6150	Then with his spirit, perturb'd, he commun'd thus:
6150	"""Me miserable!  which way shall I choose?"
6150	'Twere ill indeed that I should turn to flight
6150	By hostile numbers daunted; yet 'twere worse
6150	Here to be caught alone; and Saturn's son
6150	With panic fear the other Greeks hath fill'd.
6150	Yet why, my soul, admit such thoughts as these?
6150	I know that cowards from the battle fly;
6150	But he who boasts a warrior's name, must learn,
6150	"Wounded or wounding, firmly still to stand."""
6150	""
6150	While in his mind and spirit thus he mus'd,
6150	Onward the buckler'd ranks of Trojans came,
6150	And, to their harm, encircled him around.
6150	As when a boar, by dogs and stalwart youths
6150	Attack'd, the shelt'ring thicket leaves, and whets
6150	The tusks that gleam between his curved jaws;
6150	They crowd around, though ring his clatt'ring tusks,
6150	And, fearful though it be, await his rush:
6150	So crowded round Ulysses, dear to Jove,
6150	The Trojans; he, with brandish'd spear aloft,
6150	Sprang forth, and through the shoulder, from above,
6150	Deiopites wounded: Thoon next
6150	He slew, and Ennomus; then with his spear
6150	Chersidamas, in act to quit his car,
6150	Thrust through the loins below his bossy shield:
6150	Prone in the dust, he clutch'd the blood-stain'd soil.
6150	From these he turn'd; and wounded with his spear
6150	Charops, the high-born Socus' brother, son
6150	Of Hippasus; then forward sprang, to aid
6150	His brother, godlike Socus; close he stood
6150	Before Ulysses, and address'd him thus:
6150	"""Far-fam'd Ulysses, as in arms, in wiles"
6150	Unwearied, thou this day o'er both the sons
6150	Of Hippasus, two mighty warriors slain,
6150	And of their armour spoil'd, shalt make thy boast,
6150	"Or by my spear thyself shalt lose thy life."""
6150	He said, and on the shield's broad circle struck:
6150	Through the bright shield the sturdy weapon drove,
6150	And through the rich-wrought baldrick, from the ribs
6150	Tearing the flesh away; but Pallas seiz'd,
6150	And turn'd it from the vital parts aside.
6150	The wound, Ulysses knew, was not to death,
6150	And back he drew, and thus to Socus cried:
6150	""
6150	"""Ill-fated thou! thy doom hath found thee now;"
6150	Me hast thou hinder'd from the war awhile;
6150	But thee to swift destruction and dark death,
6150	This day I doom: great glory, of thee subdued,
6150	"Shall I obtain, and Hades take thy soul."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he: and Socus, turning, sought to fly;
6150	But as he turn'd him round, Ulysses' spear
6150	Behind his neck, between the shoulder blades
6150	Was driv'n, and through his chest; thund'ring he fell,
6150	And o'er his fall Ulysses, vaunting, thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Socus, thou son of warlike Hippasus,"
6150	Here hast thou found, nor couldst escape, thy doom.
6150	Ill-fated thou! nor sire's nor mother's hand
6150	Shall gather up thy bones, but carrion birds
6150	O'er thee shall flap their baleful wings, and tear
6150	Thy mangled flesh; for me, whene'er I die
6150	"The sons of Greece will build my fun'ral pile."""
6150	From out his flesh, and from the bossy shield,
6150	The spear of Socus, as he spoke, he drew;
6150	And as he drew it forth, out gush'd his blood,
6150	With anguish keen. The Trojans, when they saw
6150	Ulysses' blood, with clam'rous shouts advanc'd
6150	Promiscuous; he, retiring, shouted loud
6150	To call his comrades; loud as head of man
6150	Could bear, he shouted thrice; and thrice his shout
6150	The warlike Menelaus heard, and thus
6150	To Ajax, standing by his side, he spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Ajax, thou Heav'n-born son of Telamon,"
6150	Great chief of men, methinks I hear the voice
6150	Of stout Ulysses, as though left alone,
6150	And in the stubborn fight cut off from aid,
6150	By Trojans overmaster'd. Haste we then,
6150	For so 'twere best, to give him present aid.
6150	Brave though he be, yet left alone, I fear
6150	"Great cause we Greeks may have to mourn his loss."""
6150	""
6150	He spoke, and led the way; the godlike chief
6150	Follow'd his steps: Ulysses, dear to Jove,
6150	Surrounded by the Trojan host they found,
6150	As hungry jackals on the mountain side
6150	Around a stag, that from an archer's hand
6150	Hath taken hurt, yet while his blood was warm
6150	And limbs yet serv'd, has baffled his pursuit;
6150	But when the fatal shaft has drain'd his strength,
6150	Thirsting for blood, beneath the forest shade,
6150	The jackals seize their victim; then if chance
6150	A hungry lion pass, the jackals shrink
6150	In terror back, while he devours the prey;
6150	So round Ulysses, sage in council, press'd
6150	The Trojans, many and brave, yet nobly he
6150	Averted, spear in hand, the fatal hour;
6150	Till, with his tow'r-like shield before him borne,
6150	Appear'd great Ajax, and beside him stood.
6150	Hither and thither then the Trojans fled;
6150	While with supporting arm from out the crowd
6150	The warlike Menelaus led him forth,
6150	Till his attendant with his car drew near.
6150	Then Ajax, on the Trojans springing, slew
6150	Doryclus, royal Priam's bastard son;
6150	Next Pyrasus he smote, and Pandocus,
6150	Lysander, and Pylartes; as a stream,
6150	Swoll'n by the rains of Heav'n, that from the hills
6150	Pours down its wintry torrent on the plain;
6150	And many a blighted oak, and many a pine
6150	It bears, with piles of drift-wood, to the sea
6150	So swept illustrious Ajax o'er the plain,
6150	O'erthrowing men and horses; though unknown
6150	To Hector; he, upon Scamander's banks
6150	Was warring on the field's extremest left,
6150	Where round great Nestor and the warlike King
6150	Idomeneus, while men were falling fast,
6150	Rose, irrepressible, the battle cry.
6150	Hector, 'mid these, was working wondrous deeds,
6150	With spear and car, routing th' opposed youth;
6150	Yet had the Greeks ev'n so their ground maintain'd,
6150	But godlike Paris, fair-hair'd Helen's Lord,
6150	Through the right shoulder, with a three-barb'd shaft,
6150	As in the front he fought, Machaon quell'd:
6150	For him the warrior Greeks were sore afraid
6150	Lest he, as back the line of battle roll'd,
6150	Might to the foe be left; to Nestor then
6150	Idomeneus address'd his speech, and said:
6150	""
6150	"""O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece,"
6150	Haste thee to mount thy car, and with thee take
6150	Machaon; tow'rd the vessels urge with speed
6150	The flying steeds; worth many a life is his,
6150	The skilful leech, who knows, with practis'd hand,
6150	"T' extract the shaft, and healing drugs apply."""
6150	""
6150	He said: Gerenian Nestor at the word
6150	Mounted his car, Machaon at his side,
6150	The skilful leech, sage AEsculapius' son:
6150	He touch'd his horses; tow'rd the Grecian ships,
6150	As was his purpose, nothing loth, they flew.
6150	""
6150	To Hector then Cebriones, who saw
6150	Confus'd the Trojans' right, drew near, and said:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, we here, on th' outskirts of the field,"
6150	O'erpow'r the Greeks; on th' other side, our friends
6150	In strange confusion mingled, horse and man,
6150	Are driv'n; among them Ajax spreads dismay,
6150	The son of Telamon; I know him well,
6150	And the broad shield that o'er his shoulders hangs;
6150	Thither direct we then our car, where most
6150	In mutual slaughter horse and foot engage,
6150	"And loudest swells, uncheck'd, the battle cry."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and with the pliant lash he touch'd
6150	The sleek-skinn'd horses; springing at the sound,
6150	Between the Greeks and Trojans, light they bore
6150	The flying car, o'er bodies of the slain
6150	And broken bucklers trampling; all beneath
6150	Was plash'd with blood the axle, and the rails
6150	Around the car, as from the horses' feet,
6150	And from the felloes of the wheels, were thrown
6150	The bloody gouts; yet on he sped, to join
6150	The strife of men, and break th' opposing ranks.
6150	His coming spread confusion 'mid the Greeks,
6150	His spear awhile withheld; then through the rest,
6150	With sword, and spear, and pond'rous stones he rush'd,
6150	But shunn'd the might of Ajax Telamon.
6150	""
6150	But Jove, high thron'd, the soul of Ajax fill'd
6150	With fear; aghast he stood; his sev'nfold shield
6150	He threw behind his back, and, trembling, gaz'd
6150	Upon the crowd; then, like some beast of prey,
6150	Foot slowly following foot, reluctant turn'd.
6150	As when the rustic youths and dogs have driv'n
6150	A tawny lion from the cattle fold,
6150	Watching all night, and baulk'd him of his prey;
6150	Rav'ning for flesh, he still th' attempt renews,
6150	But still in vain: for many a jav'lin, hurl'd
6150	By vig'rous arms, confronts him to his face,
6150	And blazing faggots, that his courage daunt;
6150	Till, with the dawn, reluctant he retreat:
6150	So from before the Trojans Ajax turn'd,
6150	Reluctant, fearing for the ships of Greece.
6150	As near a field of corn, a stubborn ass,
6150	Upon whose sides had many a club been broke,
6150	O'erpow'rs his boyish guides, and ent'ring in,
6150	On the rich forage grazes; while the boys
6150	Their cudgels ply, but vain their puny strength,
6150	Yet drive him out, when fully fed, with ease:
6150	Ev'n so great Ajax, son of Telamon,
6150	The valiant Trojans and their fam'd Allies,
6150	Still thrusting at his shield, before them drove:
6150	Yet would he sometimes, rallying, hold in check
6150	The Trojan host; then turn again to flight,
6150	Yet barring still the passage to the ships.
6150	Midway between the Trojans and the Greeks
6150	He stood defiant; many jav'lins, hurl'd
6150	By vig'rous arms, were in their flight receiv'd
6150	On his broad shield; and many, ere they reach'd
6150	Their living mark, fell midway on the plain,
6150	Fix'd in the ground, in vain athirst for blood.
6150	Him thus, hard press'd by thick-thrown spears, beheld
6150	Eurypylus, Euaemon's noble son.
6150	He hasten'd up, and aim'd his glitt'ring spear;
6150	And Apisaon, Phausias' noble son,
6150	Below the midriff through the liver struck,
6150	And straight relax'd in sudden death his limbs.
6150	Forth sprang Eurypylus to seize the spoils:
6150	But godlike Paris saw, and as he stoop'd
6150	From Apisaon's corpse to strip his arms,
6150	Against Eurypylus he bent his bow,
6150	And his right thigh transfix'd; the injur'd limb
6150	Disabling, in the wound the arrow broke.
6150	He 'mid his friends, escaping death, withdrew,
6150	And to the Greeks with piercing shout he call'd:
6150	""
6150	"""O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
6150	Turn yet again, and from the doom of death
6150	Great Ajax save, hard press'd by hostile spears:
6150	Scarce can I hope he may escape with life
6150	The desp'rate fight; yet bravely stand, and aid
6150	"The mighty Ajax, son of Telamon."""
6150	""
6150	Thus spoke the wounded hero: round him they
6150	With sloping shields and spears uplifted stood:
6150	Ajax to meet them came; and when he reach'd
6150	The friendly ranks, again he turn'd to bay.
6150	So rag'd, like blazing fire, the furious fight.
6150	""
6150	Meanwhile the mares of Neleus, drench'd with sweat,
6150	Bore Nestor and Machaon from the field;
6150	Achilles saw, and mark'd them where he stood
6150	Upon his lofty vessel's prow, and watch'd
6150	The grievous toil, the lamentable rout.
6150	Then on his friend Patroclus from the ship
6150	He call'd aloud; he heard his voice, and forth,
6150	As Mars majestic, from the tent he came:
6150	(That day commenc'd his evil destiny)
6150	And thus Menoetius' noble son began:
6150	""
6150	"""Why call'st thou me? what wouldst thou, Peleus' son?"""
6150	To whom Achilles, swift of foot, replied:
6150	"""Son of Menoetius, dearest to my soul,"
6150	Soon, must the suppliant Greeks before me kneel,
6150	So insupportable is now their need.
6150	But haste thee now, Patroclus, dear to Jove:
6150	Enquire of Nestor, from the battle field
6150	Whom brings he wounded: looking from behind
6150	Most like he seem'd to AEsculapius' son,
6150	Machaon; but his face I could not see,
6150	"So swiftly past the eager horses flew."""
6150	""
6150	He said: obedient to his friend's command,
6150	Quick to the tents and ships Patroclus ran.
6150	""
6150	They, when they reach'd the tent of Neleus' son,
6150	Descended to the ground; Eurymedon
6150	The old man's mares unharness'd from the car,
6150	While on the beach they fac'd the cooling breeze,
6150	Which from their garments dried the sweat; then turn'd,
6150	And in the tent on easy seats repos'd.
6150	For them the fair-hair'd Hecamede mix'd
6150	A cordial potion; her from Tenedos,
6150	When by Achilles ta'en, the old man brought;
6150	Daughter of great Arsinous, whom the Greeks
6150	On him, their sagest councillor, bestow'd.
6150	Before them first a table fair she spread,
6150	Well polish'd, and with feet of solid bronze;
6150	On this a brazen canister she plac'd,
6150	And onions, as a relish to the wine,
6150	And pale clear honey, and pure barley meal:
6150	By these a splendid goblet, which from home
6150	Th' old man had brought, with golden studs adorn'd:
6150	Four were its handles, and round each two doves
6150	Appear'd to feed; at either end, a cup.
6150	Scarce might another move it from the board,
6150	When full; but aged Nestor rais'd with ease.
6150	In this, their goddess-like attendant first
6150	A gen'rous measure mix'd of Pramnian wine:
6150	Then with a brazen grater shredded o'er
6150	The goatsmilk cheese, and whitest barley meal,
6150	And of the draught compounded bade them drink.
6150	They drank, and then, reliev'd the parching thirst,
6150	With mutual converse entertain'd the hour.
6150	Before the gate divine Patroclus stood:
6150	The old man saw, and from his seat arose,
6150	And took him by the hand, and led him in,
6150	And bade him sit; but he, refusing, said:
6150	""
6150	"""No seat for me, thou venerable sire!"
6150	I must not stay; for he both awe and fear
6150	Commands, who hither sent me to enquire
6150	What wounded man thou hast; I need not ask,
6150	I know Machaon well, his people's guard.
6150	My errand done, I must my message bear
6150	Back to Achilles; and thou know'st thyself,
6150	Thou venerable sire, how stern his mood:
6150	"Nay sometimes blames he, where no blame is due."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
6150	"""Whence comes Achilles' pity for the Greeks"
6150	By Trojan weapons wounded? knows he not
6150	What depth of suff'ring through the camp prevails?
6150	How in the ships, by arrow or by spear
6150	Sore wounded, all our best and bravest lie?
6150	The valiant son of Tydeus, Diomed,
6150	Pierc'd by a shaft; Ulysses by a spear,
6150	And Agamemnon's self; Eurypylus
6150	By a sharp arrow through the thigh transfix'd;
6150	And here another, whom but now I bring,
6150	Shot by a bow, from off the battle field:
6150	Achilles, valiant as he is, the while
6150	For Grecian woes nor care nor pity feels.
6150	Waits he, until our ships beside the sea,
6150	In our despite, are burnt by hostile fires,
6150	And we be singly slain? not mine is now
6150	The strength I boasted once of active limbs.
6150	O that such youth and vigour yet were mine,
6150	As when about a cattle-lifting raid
6150	We fought th' Eleans; there Itymoneus
6150	I slew, the son of brave Hyperochus,
6150	Who dwelt in Elis; and my booty drove.
6150	He sought to guard the herd; but from my hand
6150	A jav'lin struck him in the foremost ranks:
6150	He fell, and terror seiz'd the rustic crowd.
6150	Abundant store of plunder from the plain
6150	We drove: of horned cattle fifty herds;
6150	As many flocks of sheep, as many droves
6150	Of swine, as many wide-spread herds of goats,
6150	And thrice so many golden-chesnut mares,
6150	The foals of many running with their dams.
6150	To Pylos, Neleus' city, these we drove
6150	By night; and much it gladden'd Neleus' heart,
6150	That I, though new to war, such prize had won.
6150	When morn appear'd, the clear-voic'd heralds call'd
6150	For all to whom from Elis debts were due;
6150	Collected thus, the Pylians' leading men
6150	Division made: for Elis ow'd us much;
6150	Such wrongs we few in Pylos had sustain'd.
6150	The might of Hercules in former years
6150	Had storm'd our town, and all our bravest slain.
6150	Twelve gallant sons had Neleus; I of these
6150	Alone was left; the others all were gone.
6150	Whence over-proud, th' Epeians treated us
6150	With insult, and high-handed violence.
6150	A herd of oxen now, and num'rous flock
6150	Of sheep, th' old man selected for himself,
6150	Three hundred, with their shepherds; for to him
6150	Large compensation was from Elis due.
6150	Train'd to the course, four horses, with their cars,
6150	He for the Tripod at th' Elean games
6150	Had sent to run; these Augeas, King of men,
6150	Detain'd, and bade the drivers home return,
6150	Bootless, and grieving for their horses' loss.
6150	Th' old man his words resenting, and his acts,
6150	Large spoils retain'd; the rest among the crowd
6150	He shar'd, that none might lose his portion due.
6150	These we dispos'd of soon, and to the Gods
6150	Due off'rings made; but when the third day rose,
6150	Back in all haste, in numbers, horse and foot,
6150	Our foes return'd; with, them the Molion twins,
6150	Yet boys, untutor'd in the arts of war.
6150	Far off, by Alpheus' banks, th' extremest verge
6150	Of sandy Pylos, is a lofty mound,
6150	The city of Thryum; which around, intent
6150	To raze its walls, their army was encamp'd.
6150	The plain already they had overspread;
6150	When Pallas from Olympus' heights came down
6150	In haste, and bade us all prepare for war.
6150	On no unwilling ears her message fell,
6150	But eager all for fight; but me, to arm
6150	Neleus forbade, and e'en my horses hid,
6150	Deeming me yet unripe for deeds of war.
6150	Yet so, albeit on foot, by Pallas' grace
6150	A name I gain'd above our noblest horse.
6150	There is a river, Minyis by name,
6150	Hard by Arene, flowing to the sea,
6150	Where we, the Pylian horse, expecting morn,
6150	Encamp'd, by troops of footmen quickly join'd.
6150	Thence in all haste advancing, all in arms,
6150	We reach'd, by midday, Alpheus' sacred stream.
6150	There, to o'erruling Jove our off'rings made,
6150	To Alpheus and to Neptune each a bull,
6150	To Pallas, blue-ey'd Maid, a heifer fair,
6150	In order'd ranks we took our ev'ning meal,
6150	And each in arms upon the river's brink
6150	Lay down to rest; for close beside us lay
6150	Th' Epeians, on the town's destruction bent.
6150	Then saw they mighty deeds of war display'd;
6150	For we, as sunlight overspread the earth,
6150	To Jove and Pallas praying, battle gave.
6150	But when the Pylians and th' Epeians met,
6150	I first a warrior slew, and seiz'd his car,
6150	Bold spearman, Mulius; Augeas' son-in-law,
6150	His eldest daughter's husband, Agamede,
6150	The yellow-hair'd, who all the virtues knew
6150	Of each medicinal herb the wide world grows.
6150	Him, with my brass-tipp'd spear, as on he came,
6150	I slew; he fell; I, rushing to his car,
6150	Stood 'mid the foremost ranks; th' Epeians brave
6150	Fled diverse, when they saw their champion fall,
6150	Chief of their horsemen, foremost in the fight.
6150	With the dark whirlwind's force, I onward rush'd,
6150	And fifty cars I took; two men in each
6150	Fell to my spear, and bit the bloody dust.
6150	Then Actor's sons, the Molions, had I slain,
6150	Had not th' Earth-shaking God, their mighty sire,
6150	Veil'd in thick cloud, withdrawn them from the field;
6150	Then Jove great glory to the Pylians gave.
6150	For o'er the wide-spread plain we held pursuit,
6150	Slaying, and gath'ring up the scatter'd arms,
6150	Nor till corn-clad Buprasium, and the rock
6150	Olenian, and Alesium, term'd the Mound,
6150	Stay'd we our steeds; there Pallas bade us turn.
6150	There the last man I slew, and left; the Greeks
6150	Back from Buprasium drove their flying cars
6150	To Pylos, magnifying all the name,
6150	'Mid men, of Nestor, as 'mid Gods, of Jove.
6150	Such once was I 'mid men, while yet I was;
6150	Now to himself alone Achilles keeps
6150	His valour; yet hereafter, when the Greeks
6150	Have perish'd all, remorse shall touch his soul.
6150	Dear friend, remember now th' injunctions giv'n
6150	By old Menoetius, when from Phthian land
6150	He sent thee forth to Agamemnon's aid:
6150	I, and Laertes' godlike son, within,
6150	Heard all his counsel; to the well-built house
6150	Of Peleus we on embassy had come,
6150	Throughout Achaia's fertile lands to raise
6150	The means of war; Menoetius there we found,
6150	Achilles, and thyself within the house;
6150	While in the court-yard aged Peleus slew,
6150	And to the Lord of thunder offer'd up
6150	A fatten'd steer; and from a golden bowl
6150	O'er the burnt-off'ring pour'd the ruddy wine.
6150	We two, while ye were busied with the flesh,
6150	Stood at the gate; surpris'd, Achilles rose,
6150	And took us by the hand, and bade us sit,
6150	Dispensing all the hospitable rites.
6150	With food and wine recruited, I began
6150	My speech, and urg'd ye both to join the war:
6150	Nor were ye loth to go; much sage advice
6150	Your elders gave; old Peleus bade his son
6150	To aim at highest honours, and surpass
6150	His comrades all; Menoetius, Actor's son,
6150	To thee this counsel gave: 'My son,' he said,
6150	'Achilles is by birth above thee far;
6150	Thou art in years the elder; he in strength
6150	Surpasses thee; do thou with prudent words
6150	And timely speech address him, and advise
6150	And guide him; he will, to his good, obey.'
6150	""
6150	"""Such were the old man's words; but thou hast let"
6150	His counsel slip thy mem'ry; yet ev'n now
6150	Speak to Achilles thus, and stir his soul,
6150	If haply he will hear thee; and who knows
6150	But by the grace of Heav'n thou mayst prevail?
6150	For great is oft a friend's persuasive pow'r.
6150	But if the fear of evil prophesied,
6150	Or message by his Goddess-mother brought
6150	From Jove, restrain him, let him send thee forth
6150	With all his force of warlike Myrmidons,
6150	That thou mayst be the saving light of Greece.
6150	Then let him bid thee to the battle bear
6150	His glitt'ring arms; if so the men of Troy,
6150	Scar'd by his likeness, may forsake the field,
6150	And breathing-time afford the sons of Greece,
6150	Toil-worn; for little pause has yet been theirs.
6150	Fresh and unwearied, ye with ease may drive
6150	To their own city, from our ships and tents,
6150	"The Trojans, worn and battle-wearied men."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; Patroclus' spirit within him burn'd,
6150	And tow'rd Achilles' tent in haste he sped.
6150	But, running, as Ulysses' ship he pass'd,
6150	Where was the Council and the Justice-seat,
6150	And where were built the altars of the Gods,
6150	There met him, halting from the battle-field,
6150	Shot through the thigh, Euaemon's Heav'n-born son,
6150	Eurypylus; his head and shoulders dank
6150	With clammy sweat, while from his grievous wound
6150	Stream'd the dark blood; yet firm was still his soul.
6150	Menoetius' noble son with pity saw,
6150	And deeply sorrowing thus address'd the chief:
6150	""
6150	"""Woe for the chiefs and councillors of Greece!"
6150	And must ye, far from friends and native home,
6150	Glut with your flesh the rav'ning dogs of Troy?
6150	Yet tell me this, Heav'n-born Eurypylus;
6150	Still do the Greeks 'gainst Hector's giant force
6150	"Make head? or fall they, vanquish'd by his spear?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom with prudent speech, Eurypylus:
6150	"""No source, Heav'n-born Patroclus, have the Greeks,"
6150	Of aid, but all must perish by their ships:
6150	For in the ships lie all our bravest late,
6150	By spear or arrow struck, by Trojan hands;
6150	And fiercer, hour by hour, their onset grows.
6150	But save me now, and lead me to the ships;
6150	There cut the arrow out, and from the wound
6150	With tepid water cleanse the clotted blood:
6150	Then soothing drugs apply, of healing pow'r,
6150	Which from Achilles, thou, 'tis said, hast learn'd,
6150	From Chiron, justest of the Centaurs, he.
6150	For Podalirius and Machaon both,
6150	Our leeches, one lies wounded in the tents,
6150	Himself requiring sore the leech's aid;
6150	"The other on the plain still dares the fight."""
6150	""
6150	To whom again Menoetius' noble son:
6150	"""How may this be? say, brave Eurypylus,"
6150	What must I do? a messenger am I,
6150	Sent by Gerenian Nestor, prop of Greece,
6150	With tidings to Achilles; yet ev'n so
6150	"I will not leave thee in this weary plight."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and passing his supporting hand
6150	Beneath his breast, the wounded warrior led
6150	Within the tent; th' attendant saw, and spread
6150	The ox-hide couch; then as he lay reclin'd,
6150	Patroclus, with his dagger, from the thigh
6150	Cut out the biting shaft; and from the wound
6150	With tepid water cleans'd the clotted blood;
6150	Then, pounded in his hands, a root applied
6150	Astringent, anodyne, which all his pain
6150	Allay'd; the wound was dried, and stanch'd the blood.

6150	The Greeks having retired into their entrenchments, Hector attempts to
6150	force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas
6150	advises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The
6150	Trojans follow his counsel, and having divided their army into five
6150	bodies of foot, begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with
6150	a serpent in his talons, which appeared on the left hand of the
6150	Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again. This Hector
6150	opposes, and continues the attack; in which, after many actions,
6150	Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall: Hector also, casting a
6150	stone of a vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters at the
6150	head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to their

6150	BOOK XII.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Thus o'er the wounded chief Eurypylus
6150	Watch'd in his tent Menoetius' noble son;
6150	But hand to hand the Greeks and Trojans fought;
6150	Nor longer might the ditch th' assault repel,
6150	Nor the broad wall above, which Greeks had built,
6150	To guard their ships, and round it dug the ditch;
6150	But to the Gods no hecatombs had paid,
6150	That they the ships and all the stores within
6150	Might safely keep; against the will of Heav'n
6150	The work was done, and thence not long endur'd.
6150	While Hector liv'd, and Peleus' son his wrath
6150	Retain'd, and Priam's city untaken stood;
6150	So long the Grecian wall remain'd entire:
6150	But of the Trojans when the best had fall'n,
6150	Of Greeks, when some were slain, some yet surviv'd;
6150	When the tenth year had seen the fall of Troy,
6150	And Greeks, embark'd, had ta'en their homeward way,
6150	Then Neptune and Apollo counsel took
6150	To sap the wall by aid of all the streams
6150	That seaward from the heights of Ida flow;
6150	Rhesus, Caresus, and Heptaporus,
6150	Granicus, and AEsepus, Rhodius,
6150	Scamander's stream divine, and Simois,
6150	Where helms and shields lay buried in the sand,
6150	And a whole race of warrior demigods:
6150	These all Apollo to one channel turn'd;
6150	Nine days against the wall the torrent beat;
6150	And Jove sent rain continuous, that the wall
6150	Might sooner be submerg'd; while Neptune's self,
6150	His trident in his hand, led on the stream,
6150	Washing away the deep foundations, laid,
6150	Laborious, by the Greeks, with logs and stones,
6150	Now by fast-flowing Hellespont dispers'd.
6150	The wall destroy'd, o'er all the shore he spread
6150	A sandy drift; and bade the streams return
6150	To where of old their silver waters flow'd.
6150	Such were, in future days, to be the works
6150	Of Neptune and Apollo; but meanwhile
6150	Fierce rag'd the battle round the firm-built wall,
6150	And frequent clatter'd on the turrets' beams
6150	The hostile missiles: by the scourge of Jove
6150	Subdued, the Greeks beside their ships were hemm'd,
6150	By Hector scar'd, fell minister of Dread,
6150	Who with the whirlwind's force, as ever, fought.
6150	As when, by dogs and hunters circled round,
6150	A boar, or lion, in his pride of strength,
6150	Turns on his foes, while they in close array
6150	Stand opposite, and frequent shoot their darts;
6150	Nor yet his spirit quails, but firm he stands
6150	With suicidal courage; swift he turns,
6150	Where best to break the circling ranks; where'er
6150	He makes his rush, the circling ranks give way:
6150	So Hector, here and there, amid the crowd,
6150	Urg'd his companions on to cross the ditch:
6150	The fiery steeds shrank back, and, snorting, stood
6150	Upon the topmost brink; for the wide ditch
6150	Withheld them, easy nor to leap nor cross:
6150	For steep arose on either side the banks,
6150	And at the top with sharpen'd stakes were crown'd,
6150	Thick-set and strong, which there the sons of Greece
6150	Had planted, to repel th' invading foes.
6150	Scarce might a horse, with well-wheel'd car attach'd,
6150	Essay the passage; but on foot they burn'd
6150	To make th' attempt; and thus Polydamas,
6150	Approaching near, to valiant Hector spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, and all ye other chiefs of Troy,"
6150	And brave Allies, in vain we seek to drive
6150	Our horses o'er the ditch; 'tis hard to cross;
6150	'Tis crown'd with pointed stakes, and them behind
6150	Is built the Grecian wall; there to descend
6150	And from our cars in narrow space to fight
6150	Were certain ruin. If it be indeed
6150	The will of Jove, high-thund'ring, to confound
6150	The Greeks in utter rout, and us to aid,
6150	I should rejoice that ev'ry Greek forthwith
6150	Far from his home should fill a nameless grave;
6150	But should they turn, and we again be driv'n
6150	Back from the ships, and hurried down the ditch,
6150	Such were our loss, that scarce a messenger
6150	Would live to bear the tidings to the town
6150	Of our destruction by the rallied Greeks.
6150	Hear then my counsel; let us all agree
6150	With our attendants here upon the bank
6150	To leave our horses; and ourselves on foot,
6150	All arm'd, press on where Hector leads; the Greeks,
6150	"If that their doom be nigh, will make no stand."""
6150	""
6150	Thus spoke Polydamas; his counsel pleas'd;
6150	And Hector sprang, in arms, from off his car;
6150	Nor long, the noble Hector when they saw,
6150	Delay'd the other chiefs; then gave command
6150	Each to his own attendant, by the ditch
6150	To keep the chariots all in due array;
6150	Then parting, form'd in order of attack,
6150	In five divisions, with their sev'ral chiefs.
6150	Round Hector throng'd, and bold Polydamas,
6150	The best and bravest; they who long'd the most
6150	To storm the wall, and fight beside the ships.
6150	With them Cebriones; for Hector left,
6150	To guard the horses, one of lesser note.
6150	The nest division was by Paris led,
6150	Agenor, and Alcathous; the third
6150	By Helenus, and brave Deiphobus,
6150	Two sons of Priam; Asius was the third,
6150	Asius, the son of Hyrtacus; who brought
6150	His tow'ring fiery steeds from Selles' stream,
6150	Hard by Arisba; stout AEneas led
6150	The fourth, Anchises' son, Archilochus
6150	With him, and Acamas, Antenor's sons;
6150	Both skill'd alike in ev'ry point of war.
6150	Of the far-fam'd Allies, Sarpedon held
6150	The chief command; and for his comrades chose
6150	Asteropaeus, and the warlike might
6150	Of Glaucus; these o'er all the rest he held
6150	Pre-eminent in valour, save himself,
6150	Who o'er them all superior stood confess'd.
6150	These, interlac'd their shields of tough bull's-hide,
6150	With eager step advanc'd, and deem'd the Greeks
6150	Would, unresisting, fall before their ships.
6150	The other Trojans and renown'd Allies
6150	The words of wise Polydamas obey'd:
6150	But Asius, son of Hyrtacus, refus'd
6150	His horses and his charioteer to leave,
6150	With them advancing to assail the ships.
6150	Blind fool, unconscious! from before those ships,
6150	Escap'd from death, with horses and with car
6150	Triumphant, to the breezy heights of Troy
6150	He never shall return; ill-omen'd fate
6150	O'ershadowing, dooms him by the spear to fall
6150	Of brave Idomeneus, Deucalion's son.
6150	He tow'rd the left inclin'd, what way the Greeks
6150	With horse and chariot from the plain return'd.
6150	That way he drove his horses; and the gates
6150	Unguarded found by bolt or massive bar.
6150	Their warders held them open'd wide, to save
6150	Perchance some comrade, flying from the plain.
6150	Thither he bent his course; with clamours loud
6150	Follow'd his troops; nor deem'd they that the Greeks
6150	Would hold their ground, but fall amid their ships.
6150	Little they knew; before the gates they found
6150	Two men, two warriors of the prime, two sons
6150	Illustrious of the spear-skill'd Lapithae:
6150	Stout Polypoetes one, Pirithous' son,
6150	With whom Leonteus, bold as blood-stain'd Mars:
6150	So stood these two before the lofty gates,
6150	As on the mountain side two tow'ring oaks,
6150	Which many a day have borne the wind and storm,
6150	Firm rifted by their strong continuous roots:
6150	So in their arms and vigour confident
6150	Those two great Asius' charge, undaunted, met.
6150	On th' other side, with, shouts and wild uproar,
6150	Their bull's-hide shields uplifted high, advanc'd
6150	Against the well-built wall, Asius the King,
6150	Iamenus, Orestes, Acamas
6150	The son of Asius, and OEnomaus,
6150	And Thoon; those within to save the ships
6150	Calling meanwhile on all the well-greav'd Greeks;
6150	But when they saw the wall by Trojans scal'd,
6150	And heard the cry of Greeks in panic fear,
6150	Sprang forth those two, before the gates to fight.
6150	As when two boars, upon the mountain side,
6150	Await th' approaching din of men and dogs,
6150	Then sideways rushing, snap the wood around,
6150	Ripp'd from the roots; loud clash their clatt'ring tusks,
6150	Till to the huntsman's spear they yield their lives;
6150	So clatter'd on those champions' brass-clad breasts
6150	The hostile weapons; stubbornly they fought,
6150	Relying on their strength, and friends above:
6150	For from the well-built tow'rs huge stones were hurl'd
6150	By those who for themselves, their tents and ships,
6150	Maintain'd defensive warfare; thick they fell,
6150	As wintry snow-flakes, which the boist'rous wind,
6150	Driving the shadowy clouds, spreads fast and close
6150	O'er all the surface of the fertile earth:
6150	So thick, from Grecian and from Trojan hands,
6150	The weapons flew; on helm and bossy shield
6150	With grating sound the pond'rous masses rang.
6150	Then deeply groaning, as he smote his thigh
6150	Thus spoke dismay'd the son of Hyrtacus:
6150	"""O Father Jove, how hast thou lov'd our hopes"
6150	To falsify, who deem'd not that the Greeks
6150	Would stand our onset, and resistless arms!
6150	But they, as yellow-banded wasps, or bees,
6150	That by some rocky pass have built their nests,
6150	Abandon not their cavern'd home, but wait
6150	Th' attack, and boldly for their offspring fight;
6150	So from the gates these two, though two alone,
6150	"Retire not, till they be or ta'en or slain."""
6150	""
6150	He said: but Jove regarded not his words;
6150	So much on Hector's triumph he was bent.
6150	Like battle rag'd round th' other gates; but hard
6150	It were for me, with godlike pow'r, to paint
6150	Each sev'ral combat; for around the wall
6150	A more than human storm of stone was pour'd
6150	On ev'ry side; the Greeks, hard press'd, perforce
6150	Fought for their ships, while all the Gods look'd on
6150	Indignant, who the Grecian cause upheld.
6150	Fiercely the Lapithae sustain'd the war:
6150	Stout Polypoetes first, Pirithous' son,
6150	Smote, through the brass-cheek'd helmet, Damasus;
6150	Nor stay'd the brazen helm the spear, whose point
6150	Went crashing through the bone, that all the brain
6150	Was shatter'd; onward as he rush'd, he fell.
6150	Then Pylon next, and Ormenus he slew:
6150	Meantime Leonteus, scion true of Mars,
6150	Struck with unerring spear Hippomachus,
6150	Son of Antimachus, below the waist;
6150	Then, drawing from the sheath his trenchant sword,
6150	Dash'd through the crowd, and hand to hand he smote
6150	Antiphates; he, backward, fell to earth.
6150	Menon, Iamenus, Orestes next,
6150	In quick succession to the ground he brought.
6150	From these while they their glitt'ring armour stripp'd,
6150	Round Hector throng'd, and bold Polydamas,
6150	The bravest and the best, who long'd the most
6150	To storm the wall, and burn with fire the ships.
6150	Yet on the margin of the ditch they paus'd;
6150	For, as they sought to cross, a sign from Heav'n
6150	Appear'd, to leftward of th' astonish'd crowd;
6150	A soaring eagle in his talons bore
6150	A dragon, huge of size, of blood-red hue,
6150	Alive, and breathing still, nor yet subdued;
6150	For twisting backward through the breast he pierc'd
6150	His bearer, near the neck; he, stung with pain,
6150	Let fall his prey, which dropp'd amid the crowd;
6150	Then screaming, on the blast was borne away.
6150	The Trojans, shudd'ring, in their midst beheld
6150	The spotted serpent, dire portent of Jove:
6150	Then to bold Hector thus Polydamas:
6150	"""Hector, in council thou reprov'st me oft"
6150	For good advice; it is not meet, thou say'st,
6150	That private men should talk beside the mark,
6150	In council or in war, but study still
6150	Thine honour to exalt; yet must I now
6150	Declare what seems to me the wisest course:
6150	Let us not fight the Greeks beside their ships;
6150	For thus I read the future, if indeed
6150	To us, about to cross, this sign from Heav'n
6150	Was sent, to leftward of th' astonish'd crowd:
6150	A soaring eagle, bearing in his claws
6150	A dragon, huge of size, of blood-red hue,
6150	Alive; yet dropp'd him ere he reach'd his home,
6150	Nor to his nestlings bore th' intended prey:
6150	So we, e'en though our mighty strength should break
6150	The gates and wall, and put the Greeks to rout,
6150	By the same road not scatheless should return,
6150	But many a Trojan on the field should leave,
6150	Slain by the Greeks, while they their ships defend.
6150	So would a seer, well vers'd in augury,
6150	"Worthy of public credit, read this sign."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm
6150	"Replied, with stern regard: ""Polydamas,"
6150	This speech of thine is alien to my soul:
6150	Thy better judgment better counsel knows.
6150	But if in earnest such is thine advice,
6150	Thee of thy senses have the Gods bereft,
6150	Who fain wouldst have us disregard the word
6150	And promise by the nod of Jove confirm'd,
6150	And put our faith in birds' expanded wings;
6150	Little of these I reck, nor care to look,
6150	If to the right, and tow'rd the morning sun,
6150	Or to the left, and shades of night, they fly.
6150	Put we our trust in Jove's eternal will,
6150	Of mortals and Immortals King supreme.
6150	The best of omens is our country's cause.
6150	Why shouldst thou tremble at the battle strife?
6150	Though ev'ry Trojan else were doom'd to die
6150	Beside the ships, no fear lest thou shouldst fall:
6150	Unwarlike is thy soul, nor firm of mood:
6150	But if thou shrink, or by thy craven words
6150	Turn back another Trojan from the fight,
6150	"My spear shall take the forfeit of thy life."""
6150	""
6150	This said, he led the way; with joyous shouts
6150	They follow'd all; then Jove, the lightning's Lord,
6150	From Ida's heights a storm of wind sent down,
6150	Driving the dust against the Grecian ships;
6150	Which quell'd their courage, and to Hector gave,
6150	And to the Trojans, fresh incitement; they,
6150	On their own strength, and heav'nly signs relying,
6150	Their force address'd to storm the Grecian wall.
6150	They raz'd the counterscarp, the battlements
6150	Destroy'd; and the projecting buttresses,
6150	Which, to sustain the tow'rs, the Greeks had fix'd
6150	Deep in the soil, with levers undermin'd.
6150	These once withdrawn, they hop'd to storm the wall;
6150	Nor from the passage yet the Greeks withdrew,
6150	But closely fencing with their bull's-hide shields
6150	The broken battlements, they thence hurl'd down
6150	A storm of weapons on the foe beneath.
6150	Commanding from the tow'r in ev'ry place
6150	Were seen th' Ajaces, urging to the fight,
6150	Imploring these, and those in sterner tones
6150	Rebuking, who their warlike toil relax'd.
6150	""
6150	"""Friends, Grecians all, ye who excel in war,"
6150	And ye of mod'rate or inferior strength,
6150	Though all are not with equal pow'rs endued,
6150	Yet here is work for all! bear this in mind,
6150	Nor tow'rd the ships let any turn his face,
6150	By threats dismay'd; but forward press, and each
6150	Encourage each, if so the lightning's Lord,
6150	Olympian Jove, may grant us to repel,
6150	"And backward to his city chase the foe."""
6150	""
6150	Thus they, with cheering words, sustain'd the war:
6150	Thick as the snow-flakes on a wintry day,
6150	When Jove, the Lord of counsel, down on men
6150	His snow-storm sends, and manifests his pow'r:
6150	Hush'd are the winds; the flakes continuous fall,
6150	That the high mountain tops, and jutting crags,
6150	And lotus-cover'd meads are buried deep,
6150	And man's productive labours of the field;
6150	On hoary Ocean's beach and bays they lie,
6150	Th' approaching waves their bound; o'er all beside
6150	Is spread by Jove the heavy veil of snow.
6150	So thickly new the stones from either side,
6150	By Greeks on Trojans hurl'd, by these on Greeks;
6150	And clatter'd loud through all its length the wall.
6150	Nor yet the Trojans, though by Hector led,
6150	The gates had broken, and the massive bar,
6150	But Jove against the Greeks sent forth his son
6150	Sarpedon, as a lion on a herd:
6150	His shield's broad orb before his breast he bore,
6150	Well-wrought, of beaten brass, which th' arm'rer's hand
6150	Had beaten out, and lin'd with stout bull's-hide;
6150	With golden rods, continuous, all around;
6150	He thus equipp'd, two jav'lins brandishing,
6150	Strode onward, as a lion, mountain-bred,
6150	Whom, fasting long, his dauntless courage leads
6150	To assail the flock, though in well-guarded fold;
6150	And though the shepherds there he find, prepar'd
6150	With dogs and lances to protect the sheep,
6150	Not unattempted will he leave the fold;
6150	But, springing to the midst, he bears his prey
6150	In triumph thence; or in the onset falls,
6150	Wounded by jav'lins hurl'd by stalwart hands:
6150	So, prompted by his godlike courage, burn'd
6150	Sarpedon to assail the lofty wall,
6150	And storm the ramparts; and to Glaucus thus,
6150	Son of Hippolochus, his speech address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Whence is it, Glaucus, that in Lycian land"
6150	We two at feasts the foremost seats may claim,
6150	The largest portions, and the fullest cups?
6150	Why held as Gods in honour? why endow'd
6150	With ample heritage, by Xanthus' banks,
6150	Of vineyard, and of wheat producing land?
6150	Then by the Lycians should we not be seen
6150	The foremost to affront the raging fight?
6150	So may our well-arm'd Lycians make their boast;
6150	'To no inglorious Kings we Lycians owe
6150	Allegiance; they on richest viands feed;
6150	Of luscious flavour drink the choicest wine;
6150	But still their valour brightest shows; and they,
6150	Where Lycians war, are foremost in the fight!'
6150	O friend! if we, survivors of this war,
6150	Could live, from age and death for ever free,
6150	Thou shouldst not see me foremost in the fight,
6150	Nor would I urge thee to the glorious field:
6150	But since on man ten thousand forms of death
6150	Attend, which none may 'scape, then on, that we
6150	"May glory on others gain, or they on us!"""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; nor Glaucus from his bidding shrank;
6150	And forward straight they led the Lycian pow'rs.
6150	Menestheus, son of Peteus, with dismay
6150	Observ'd their movement; for on his command,
6150	Inspiring terror, their attack was made.
6150	He look'd around him to the Grecian tow'rs,
6150	If any chief might there be found, to save
6150	His comrades from destruction; there he saw,
6150	Of war insatiable, th' Ajaces twain;
6150	And Teucer, from the tent but newly come,
6150	Hard by; nor yet could reach them with his voice;
6150	Such was the din, such tumult rose to Heav'n,
6150	From clatt'ring shields, and horsehair-crested helms,
6150	And batter'd gates, now all at once assail'd:
6150	Before them fiercely strove th' assaulting bands
6150	To break their way: he then Thootes sent,
6150	His herald, to th' Ajaces, craving aid.
6150	""
6150	"""Haste thee, Thootes, on th' Ajaces call,"
6150	Both, if it may be; so we best may hope
6150	To 'scape the death, which else is near at hand;
6150	So fierce the pressure of the Lycian chiefs,
6150	Undaunted now, as ever, in the fight.
6150	But if they too are hardly press'd, at least
6150	Let Ajax, son of Telamon, be spar'd,
6150	"And with him Teucer, skilled to draw the bow."""
6150	He said; the herald heard, and straight obey'd;
6150	Along the wall, where stood the brass-clad Greeks,
6150	He ran, and standing near th' Ajaces, said:
6150	""
6150	"""Ajaces, leaders of the brass-clad Greeks,"
6150	The son of Heav'n-born Peteus craves your aid.
6150	To share awhile the labours of his guard;
6150	Both, if it may be; so he best may hope
6150	To 'scape the death, which else is near at hand:
6150	So fierce the pressure of the Lycian chiefs,
6150	Undaunted now, as ever, in the fight.
6150	But if ye too are hardly press'd, at least
6150	Let Ajax, son of Telamon, be spar'd,
6150	"And with him Teucer, skill'd to draw the bow."""
6150	""
6150	He said: the mighty son of Telamon
6150	Consenting, thus addresss'd Oileus' son:
6150	"""Ajax, do thou and valiant Lyeomede"
6150	Exhort the Greeks the struggle to maintain;
6150	While I go yonder, to affront the war,
6150	"To aid their need, and back return in haste."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, Ajax Telamon set forth,
6150	And with him Teucer went, his father's son,
6150	While by Pandion Teucer's bow was borne.
6150	At brave Menestheus' tow'r, within the wall,
6150	Arriv'd, sore press'd they found the garrison;
6150	For like a whirlwind on the ramparts pour'd
6150	The Lycians' valiant councillors and chiefs.
6150	They quickly join'd the fray, and loud arose
6150	The battle-cry; first Ajax Telamon
6150	Sarpedon's comrade, brave Epicles, slew,
6150	Struck by a rugged stone, within the wall
6150	Which lay, the topmost of the parapet,
6150	Of size prodigious; which with both his hands
6150	A man in youth's full vigour scarce could raise,
6150	As men are now; he lifted it on high,
6150	And downward hurl'd; the four-peak'd helm it broke,
6150	Crushing the bone, and shatt'ring all the skull;
6150	He, like a diver, from the lofty tow'r
6150	Fell headlong down, and life forsook his bones,
6150	Teucer, meanwhile, from off the lofty wall
6150	The valiant Glaucus, pressing to the fight,
6150	Struck with an arrow, where he saw his arm
6150	Unguarded; he no longer brook'd the fray;
6150	Back from the wall he sprang, in hopes to hide
6150	From Grecian eyes his wound, that none might see,
6150	And triumph o'er him with insulting words.
6150	With grief Sarpedon saw his friend withdraw,
6150	Yet not relax'd his efforts; Thestor's son,
6150	Alcmaon, with his spear he stabb'd, and back
6150	The weapon drew; he, following, prostrate fell,
6150	And loudly rang his arms of polish'd brass.
6150	Then at the parapet, with stalwart hand,
6150	Sarpedon tugg'd; and yielding to his force
6150	Down fell the block entire; the wall laid bare,
6150	To many at once the breach gave open way.
6150	Ajax and Teucer him at once assail'd;
6150	This with an arrow struck the glitt'ring belt
6150	Around his breast, whence hung his pond'rous shield;
6150	But Jove, who will'd not that his son should fall
6150	Before the ships, the weapon turn'd aside.
6150	Then forward Ajax sprang, and with his spear
6150	Thrust at the shield; the weapon pass'd not through,
6150	Yet check'd his bold advance; a little space
6150	Back he recoil'd, but not the more withdrew,
6150	His soul on glory intent; and rallying quick,
6150	Thus to the warlike Lycians shouted loud:
6150	""
6150	"""Why, Lycians, thus your wonted might relax?"
6150	'Tis hard for one alone, how brave soe'er,
6150	E'en though he break the rampart down, to force
6150	A passage to the ships; but on with me!
6150	"For work is here for many hands to do."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and by the King's rebuke abash'd,
6150	With fiercer zeal the Lycians press'd around
6150	Their King and councillor; on th' other side
6150	Within the wall the Greeks their squadrons mass'd;
6150	Then were great deeds achiev'd; nor thro' the breach
6150	Could the brave troops of Lycia to the ships
6150	Their passage force; nor could the warrior Greeks
6150	Repel the Lycians from the ground, where they,
6150	Before the wall, had made their footing good.
6150	As when two neighbours, in a common field,
6150	Each line in hand, within a narrow space,
6150	About the limits of their land contend;
6150	Between them thus the rampart drew the line;
6150	O'er which the full-orb'd shields of tough bull's-hide,
6150	And lighter bucklers on the warriors' breasts
6150	On either side they clove; and many a wound
6150	The pitiless weapons dealt, on some who, turn'd,
6150	Their neck and back laid bare; on many more,
6150	Who full in front, and through their shields were struck.
6150	On ev'ry side the parapet and tow'rs
6150	With Greek and Trojan blood were spatter'd o'er.
6150	Nor yet, e'en so, the Greeks to flight were driv'n;
6150	But as a woman that for wages spins,
6150	Honest and true, with wool and weights in hand,
6150	In even balance holds the scales, to mete
6150	Her humble hire, her children's maintenance;
6150	So even hung the balance of the war,
6150	Till Jove with highest honour Hector crown'd,
6150	The son of Priam; he, the foremost, scal'd
6150	The wall, and loudly on the Trojans call'd:
6150	""
6150	"""On, valiant Trojans, on! the Grecian wall"
6150	"Break down, and wrap their ships in blazing fires."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he, exhorting, spoke; they heard him all,
6150	And to the wall rush'd numberless, and swarm'd
6150	Upon the ramparts, bristling thick with spears.
6150	Then Hector, stooping, seiz'd a pond'rous stone
6150	That lay before the gates; 'twas broad below,
6150	But sharp above; and scarce two lab'ring men,
6150	The strongest, from the ground could raise it up,
6150	And load upon a wain; as men are now;
6150	But he unaided lifted it with ease,
6150	So light it seem'd, by grace of Saturn's son.
6150	As in one hand a shepherd bears with ease
6150	A full-siz'd fleece, and scarcely feels the weight;
6150	So Hector tow'rd the portals bore the stone,
6150	Which clos'd the lofty double-folding gates,
6150	Within defended by two massive bars
6150	Laid crosswise, and with one cross bolt secur'd.
6150	Close to the gate he stood; and planting firm
6150	His foot, to give his arm its utmost pow'r,
6150	Full on the middle dash'd the mighty mass.
6150	The hinges both gave way; the pond'rous stone
6150	Fell inwards; widely gap'd the op'ning gates;
6150	Nor might the bars within the blow sustain:
6150	This way and that the sever'd portals flew
6150	Before the crashing missile; dark as night
6150	His low'ring brow, great Hector sprang within;
6150	Bright flash'd the brazen armour on his breast,
6150	As through the gates, two jav'lins in his hand,
6150	He sprang; the Gods except, no pow'r might meet
6150	That onset; blaz'd his eyes with lurid fire.
6150	Then to the Trojans, turning to the throng,
6150	He call'd aloud to scale the lofty wall;
6150	They heard, and straight obey'd; some scal'd the wall:
6150	Some through the strong-built gates continuous pour'd;
6150	While in confusion irretrievable
6150	Fled to their ships the panic-stricken Greeks.

6150	THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS. THE

6150	""
6150	Neptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the
6150	fortification forced by Hector (who had entered the gate near the
6150	station of the Ajaces), assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires
6150	those heroes to oppose him; then, in the form of one of the generals,
6150	encourages the other Greeks who had retired to their vessels. The
6150	Ajaces form their troops into a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector
6150	and the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones,
6150	losing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent
6150	of Idomeneus; this occasions a conversation between these two warriors,
6150	who return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his courage
6150	above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous; Deiphobus
6150	and AEneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus
6150	wounds Helenus and kills Peisander. The Trojans are repulsed in the
6150	left wing. Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till,
6150	being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to
6150	call a council of war: Hector approves his advice, but goes first to
6150	rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again,
6150	and renews the attack.

6150	The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the

6150	BOOK XIII.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	When Jove had Hector and the Trojans brought
6150	Close to the ships, he left them there to toil
6150	And strife continuous; turning his keen glance
6150	To view far off th' equestrian tribes of Thrace,
6150	The warlike Mysians, and the men who feed
6150	On milk of mares, thence Hippemolgi term'd;
6150	A peaceful race, the justest of mankind.
6150	On Troy he turn'd not once his piercing glance;
6150	Nor deem'd he any God would dare to give
6150	To Trojans or to Greeks his active aid.
6150	""
6150	No careless watch the monarch Neptune kept:
6150	Wond'ring, he view'd the battle, where he sat
6150	Aloft on wooded Samos' topmost peak,
6150	Samos of Thrace; whence Ida's heights he saw,
6150	And Priam's city, and the ships of Greece.
6150	""
6150	Thither ascended from the sea, he sat;
6150	And thence the Greeks, by Trojans overborne,
6150	Pitying he saw, and deeply wroth with Jove.
6150	Then down the mountain's craggy side he pass'd
6150	With rapid step; and as he mov'd along,
6150	Beneath th' immortal feet of Ocean's Lord
6150	Quak'd the huge mountain and the shadowy wood.
6150	Three strides he took; the fourth, he reach'd his goal,
6150	AEgae; where on the margin of the bay
6150	His temple stood, all glitt'ring, all of gold,
6150	Imperishable; there arriv'd, he yok'd
6150	Beneath his car the brazen-footed steeds,
6150	Of swiftest flight, with manes of flowing gold.
6150	All clad in gold, the golden lash he grasp'd
6150	Of curious work, and mounting on his car,
6150	Skimm'd o'er the waves; from all the depths below
6150	Gamboll'd around the monsters of the deep,
6150	Acknowledging their King; the joyous sea
6150	Parted her waves; swift flew the bounding steeds,
6150	Nor was the brazen axle wet with spray,
6150	When to the ships of Greece their Lord they bore.
6150	""
6150	Down in the deep recesses of the sea
6150	A spacious cave there is, which lies midway
6150	'Twixt Tenedos and Imbros' rocky isle:
6150	Th' Earth-shaking Neptune there his coursers stay'd,
6150	Loos'd from the chariot, and before them plac'd
6150	Ambrosial provender; and round their feet
6150	Shackles of gold, which none might break nor loose,
6150	That there they might await their Lord's return;
6150	Then to the Grecian army took his way.
6150	""
6150	Meantime, by Hector, son of Priam, led,
6150	Like fire, or whirlwind, press'd the Trojans on,
6150	With furious zeal, and shouts and clamour hoarse;
6150	In hopes to take the ships, and all the chiefs
6150	To slay beside them; but from Ocean's depths
6150	Uprose th' Earth-shaker, Circler of the Earth,
6150	To Calchas' likeness and deep voice conform'd,
6150	And rous'd the fainting Greeks; th' Ajaces first,
6150	Themselves with ardour fill'd, he thus address'd:
6150	"""'Tis yours, Ajaces, fill'd with courage high,"
6150	Discarding chilly fear, to save the Greeks:
6150	Elsewhere I dread not much the Trojan force,
6150	Though they in crowds have scal'd the lofty wall;
6150	The well-greav'd Greeks their onset may defy.
6150	Yet greatly fear I lest we suffer loss,
6150	Where that fierce, fiery madman, Hector, leads.
6150	Who boasts himself the son of Jove most high.
6150	But may some God your hearts inspire, yourselves
6150	Firmly to stand, and cheer your comrades on;
6150	So from your swiftly-sailing ships ye yet
6150	May drive the foe, how bold soe'er he be,
6150	"Though by Olympian Jove himself upheld."""
6150	""
6150	So spake th' Earth-shaker, Circler of the Earth,
6150	And with his sceptre touching both the chiefs,
6150	Fill'd them with strength and courage, and their limbs,
6150	Their feet and hands, with active vigour strung;
6150	Then like a swift-wing'd falcon sprang to flight,
6150	Which down the sheer face of some lofty rock
6150	Swoops on the plain to seize his feather'd prey:
6150	So swiftly Neptune left the chiefs; him first
6150	Departing, knew Oileus' active son,
6150	And thus the son of Telamon address'd:
6150	"""Ajax, since some one of th' Olympian Gods,"
6150	In likeness of a seer, hath hither come
6150	To urge us to the war (no Calchas he,
6150	Our augur Heav'n-inspir'd; for well I mark'd
6150	His movements, as he went; and of a God
6150	'Tis easy to discern the outward signs),
6150	I feel fresh spirit kindled in my breast,
6150	"And new-born vigour in my feet and hands."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the son of Telamon:
6150	"""My hands too grasp with firmer hold the spear,"
6150	My spirit like thine is stirr'd; I feel my feet
6150	Instinct with fiery life; nor should I fear
6150	With Hector, son of Priam, in his might
6150	"Alone to meet, and grapple to the death."""
6150	""
6150	Such was their mutual converse, as they joy'd
6150	In the fierce transport by the God inspir'd.
6150	Neptune, meanwhile, the other Greeks arous'd,
6150	Who, to the ships withdrawn, their wasted strength
6150	Recruited; for their limbs were faint with toil,
6150	And grief was in their hearts, as they beheld
6150	The Trojan hosts that scal'd the lofty wall;
6150	They saw, and from their eyes the teardrops fell,
6150	Of safety desp'rate; but th' Earth-shaking God
6150	Amid their ranks appearing, soon restor'd
6150	Their firm array; to Teucer first he came,
6150	To Leitus, and valiant Peneleus,
6150	Thoas, Deipyrus, Meriones,
6150	And young Antilochus, brave warriors all,
6150	And to the chiefs his winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Shame on ye, Grecian youths! to you I look'd"
6150	As to our ships' defenders; but if ye
6150	Shrink from the perilous battle, then indeed
6150	Our day is come, to be by Troy subdu'd.
6150	O Heav'n! a sad and wondrous sight is this,
6150	A sight I never deem'd my eyes should see,
6150	Our ships assail'd by Trojan troops; by those
6150	Who heretofore have been as tim'rous hinds
6150	Amid the forest depths, the helpless prey
6150	Of jackals, pards, and wolves; they here and there,
6150	Uncertain, heartless, unresisting, fly:
6150	Such were the Trojans once; nor dar'd abide,
6150	No, not an hour, the strength and arms of Greece;
6150	And these are they, who now beside our ships,
6150	Far from their city walls, maintain the fight,
6150	Embolden'd by our great commander's fault,
6150	And slackness of the people, who, with him
6150	Offended, scarce are brought to guard our ships.
6150	And, feebly fighting, are beside them slain.
6150	E'en though the mighty monarch, Atreus' son,
6150	Wide-ruling Agamemnon, be in truth
6150	Wholly to blame in this, that he hath wrong'd
6150	The son of Peleus, yet 'tis not for us
6150	Our courage to relax. Arouse ye then!
6150	A brave man's spirit its vigour soon regains.
6150	That ye, the best and bravest of the host,
6150	Should stand aloof thus idly, 'tis not well;
6150	If meaner men should from the battle shrink,
6150	I might not blame them; but that such as ye
6150	Should falter, indignation fills my soul.
6150	Dear friends, from this remissness must accrue
6150	Yet greater evils; but with gen'rous shame
6150	And keen remorse let each man's breast be fill'd;
6150	Fierce is the struggle; in his pride of strength
6150	Hector has forc'd the gates and massive bars,
6150	"And raging, 'mid the ships maintains the war."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Neptune on the Greeks, reproving, call'd:
6150	Then round th' Ajaces twain were cluster'd thick
6150	The serried files, whose firm array nor Mars,
6150	Nor spirit-stirring Pallas might reprove:
6150	For there, the bravest all, in order due,
6150	Waited the Trojan charge by Hector led:
6150	Spear close by spear, and shield by shield o'erlaid,
6150	Buckler to buckler press'd, and helm to helm,
6150	And man to man; the horsehair plumes above,
6150	That nodded on the warriors' glitt'ring crests,
6150	Each other touch'd; so closely massed they stood.
6150	Backward, by many a stalwart hand, were drawn
6150	The spears, in act to hurl; their eyes and minds
6150	Turn'd to the front, and eager for the fray.
6150	On pour'd the Trojan masses; in the van
6150	Hector straight forward urg'd his furious course.
6150	As some huge boulder, from its rocky bed
6150	Detach'd, and by the wintry torrent's force
6150	Hurl'd down the cliff's steep face, when constant rains
6150	The massive rock's firm hold have undermin'd;
6150	With giant bounds it flies; the crashing wood
6150	Resounds beneath it; still it hurries on,
6150	Until, arriving at the level plain,
6150	Its headlong impulse check'd, it rolls no more;
6150	So Hector, threat'ning now through ships and tents,
6150	E'en to the sea, to force his murd'rous way,
6150	Anon, confronted by that phalanx firm,
6150	Halts close before it; while the sons of Greece,
6150	With thrust of sword and double-pointed spears,
6150	Stave off his onset; he a little space
6150	Withdrew, and loudly on the Trojans call'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Trojans, and Lycians, and ye Dardans fam'd"
6150	In close encounter, stand ye firm! not long
6150	The Greeks, though densely mass'd, shall bar my way,
6150	But soon, methinks, before my spear shall quail,
6150	If from the chief of Gods my mission be,
6150	"From Jove the Thund'rer, royal Juno's Lord."""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh courage rais'd in ev'ry breast;
6150	On loftiest deeds intent, Deiphobus,
6150	The son of Priam, from the foremost ranks,
6150	His shield's broad orb before him borne, advanc'd
6150	With airy step, protected by the shield:
6150	At him Meriones with glitt'ring spear
6150	Took aim, nor miss'd his mark; the shield's broad orb
6150	Of tough bull's-hide it struck; but pass'd not through,
6150	For near the head the sturdy shaft was snapp'd.
6150	Yet from before his breast Deiphobus
6150	Held at arm's length his shield; for much he fear'd
6150	The weapon of Meriones; but he
6150	Back to his comrades' shelt'ring ranks withdrew,
6150	Griev'd at his baffled hopes and broken spear.
6150	Then tow'rd the ships he bent his steps, to seek
6150	Another spear, which in his tent remain'd.
6150	The rest, 'mid wild uproar, maintain'd the fight.
6150	""
6150	There Teucer first, the son of Telamon,
6150	A warrior slew, the son of Mentor, Lord
6150	Of num'rous horses, Imbrius, spearman skill'd.
6150	In former days, ere came the sons of Greece,
6150	He in Pedaeus dwelt, and had to wife
6150	Medesicaste, Priam's bastard child;
6150	But when the well-trimm'd ships of Greece appear'd,
6150	Return'd to Troy; and there, rever'd by all,
6150	With Priam dwelt, who lov'd him as a son.
6150	Him Teucer with his lance below the ear
6150	Stabb'd, and drew back the weapon; down he fell,
6150	As by the woodman's axe, on some high peak,
6150	Falls a proud ash, conspicuous from afar,
6150	Scatt'ring its tender foliage on the ground;
6150	He fell; and loud his burnish'd armour rang.
6150	Forth Teucer sprang to seize the spoil; at whom,
6150	Advancing, Hector aim'd his glitt'ring spear;
6150	He saw, and, stooping, shunn'd the brazen death
6150	A little space; but through the breast it struck
6150	Amphimachus, the son of Cteatus,
6150	The son of Actor, hastening to the fight:
6150	Thund'ring he fell, and loud his armour rang.
6150	Then forward Hector sprang, in hopes to seize
6150	The brazen helm, that fitted well the brow
6150	Of brave Amphimachus; but Ajax met
6150	Th' advance of Hector with his glitt'ring spear;
6150	Himself he reach'd not, all in dazzling brass
6150	Encas'd; but pressing on his bossy shield
6150	Drove by main force beyond where lay the dead:
6150	Them both the Greeks withdrew; th' Athenian chiefs
6150	Stychius and brave Menestheus, bore away
6150	Amid the ranks of Greece Amphimachus;
6150	While, as two lions high above the ground
6150	Bear through the brushwood in their jaws a goat,
6150	Snatch'd from the sharp-fang'd dogs' protecting care:
6150	So, fill'd with warlike rage, th' Ajaces twain
6150	Lifted on high, and of its armour stripp'd
6150	The corpse of Imbrius; and Oileus' son,
6150	Griev'd at Amphimachus, his comrade's death,
6150	Cut from the tender neck, and like a ball
6150	Sent whirling through the crowd the sever'd head;
6150	And in the dust at Hector's feet it fell.
6150	Then, for his grandson slain, fierce anger fill'd
6150	The breast of Neptune; through the tents of Greece
6150	And ships he pass'd, the Greeks encouraging,
6150	And ills preparing for the sons of Troy.
6150	Him met Idomeneus, the warrior King,
6150	Leaving a comrade, from the battle field,
6150	Wounded behind the knee, but newly brought;
6150	Borne by his comrades, to the leech's care
6150	He left him, eager to rejoin the fray;
6150	Whom by his tent th' Earth-shaking God address'd,
6150	The voice assuming of Andraemon's son,
6150	Who o'er th' AEtolians, as a God rever'd,
6150	In Pleuron reign'd, and lofty Calydon:
6150	""
6150	"""Where now, Idomeneus, sage Cretan chief,"
6150	Are all the vaunting threats, so freely pour'd
6150	"Against the Trojans by the sons of Greece?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cretan King, Idomeneus:
6150	"""Thoas, on none, so far as I may judge,"
6150	May blame be cast; we all our duties know;
6150	Nor see I one by heartless fear restrain'd,
6150	Nor hanging back, and flinching from the war:
6150	Yet by th' o'erruling will of Saturn's son
6150	It seems decreed that here the Greeks should fall,
6150	And far from Argos lie in nameless graves.
6150	But, Thoas, as thyself art ever staunch,
6150	Nor slow the laggards to reprove, thy work
6150	"Remit not now; but rouse each sev'ral man."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Earth-shaking Neptune thus replied:
6150	"""Idomeneus, may he from Troy return"
6150	No more, but here remain to glut the dogs,
6150	If such there be, from this day's fight who shrinks.
6150	But haste thee, don thine arms; great need is now
6150	To hasten, if in aught we two may serve:
6150	E'en meaner men, united, courage gain;
6150	"But we the bravest need not fear to meet."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and to the strife of men return'd.
6150	Within his well-constructed tent arriv'd,
6150	Straight donn'd Idomeneus his armour bright:
6150	Two spears he took; and, like the lightning's flash,
6150	Which, as a sign to men, the hand of Jove
6150	Hurls downwards from Olympus' glitt'ring heights;
6150	Whose dazzling radiance far around is thrown;
6150	Flash'd, as the warrior ran, his armour bright.
6150	Him met Meriones, his follower brave,
6150	Close to the tent; to seek a spear he came;
6150	"To whom Idomeneus: ""Meriones,"
6150	Swift-footed son of Molus, comrade dear,
6150	Why com'st thou here, and leav'st the battle field?
6150	Hast thou some wound receiv'd, whereof the pain
6150	Subdues thy spirit? or com'st thou, to the field
6150	To summon me? unsummon'd, well thou know'st
6150	"I better love the battle than the tent."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the sage Meriones:
6150	"""Idomeneus, the brass-clad Cretans' King,"
6150	I come to seek a spear, if haply such
6150	Within thy tent be found; for, in the fight,
6150	That which I lately bore, e'en now I broke
6150	"Against the shield of brave Deiphobus."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Idomeneus, the Cretan King:
6150	"""Of spears, or one, or twenty, if thou list,"
6150	Thou there mayst find against the polish'd wall.
6150	The spoil of Trojans slain; for with my foes
6150	'Tis not my wont to wage a distant war.
6150	Thence have I store of spears, and bossy shields,
6150	"And crested helms, and breastplates polish'd bright."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the sage Meriones:
6150	"""Nor are my tent and dark-ribb'd ship devoid"
6150	Of Trojan spoils; but they are far to seek;
6150	Nor deem I that my hand is slack in fight;
6150	For 'mid the foremost in the glorious strife
6150	I stand, whene'er is heard the battle cry.
6150	My deeds by others of the brass-clad Greeks
6150	"May not be noted; but thou know'st them well."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Idomeneus, the Cretan King:
6150	"""What need of this? thy prowess well I know;"
6150	For should we choose our bravest through the fleet
6150	To man the secret ambush, surest test
6150	Of warriors' courage, where is manifest
6150	The diff'rence 'twixt the coward and the brave;
6150	(The coward's colour changes, nor his soul
6150	Within his breast its even balance keeps,
6150	But changing still, from foot to foot he shifts,
6150	And in his bosom loudly beats his heart,
6150	Expecting death; and chatter all his teeth:
6150	The brave man's colour changes not; no fear
6150	He knows, the ambush ent'ring; all his pray'r
6150	Is that the hour of battle soon may come)
6150	E'en there, thy courage none might call in doubt.
6150	Shouldst thou from spear or sword receive a wound,
6150	Not on thy neck behind, nor on thy back
6150	Would fall the blow, but on thy breast, in front,
6150	Still pressing onward 'mid the foremost ranks.
6150	But come, prolong we not this idle talk,
6150	Like babblers vain, who scorn might justly move:
6150	"Haste to my tent, and there select thy spear."""
6150	""
6150	He said: and from the tent Meriones,
6150	Valiant as Mars, his spear selected straight,
6150	And, eager for the fray, rejoin'd his chief.
6150	As Mars, the bane of men, goes forth to war,
6150	Attended by his strong, unfearing son,
6150	Terror, who shakes the bravest warrior's soul;
6150	They two, from Thrace, against the Ephyri,
6150	Or haughty Phlegyans arm; nor hear alike
6150	The pray'rs of both the combatants, one side
6150	With vict'ry crowning; so to battle went
6150	Those leaders twain, in dazzling arms array'd:
6150	Then thus Meriones his chief address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Son of Deucalion, say if on the right,"
6150	Or on the centre of the gen'ral host,
6150	Our onset should be made, or on the left;
6150	"For there, methinks, most succour need the Greeks."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Idomeneus, the Cretan chief:
6150	"""Others there are the centre to defend,"
6150	Th' Ajaces both, and Teucer, of the Greeks
6150	Best archer, good too in the standing fight;
6150	These may for Hector full employment find,
6150	Brave as he is, and eager for the fray;
6150	E'en for his courage 'twere a task too hard,
6150	Their might to conquer, and resistless hands,
6150	And burn the ships, if Saturn's son himself
6150	Fire not, and 'mid the shipping throw the torch.
6150	Great Ajax Telamon to none would yield,
6150	Of mortal birth, by earthly food sustain'd,
6150	By spear or pond'rous stone assailable;
6150	In hand to hand encounter, scarce surpass'd
6150	By Peleus' son Achilles; though with him
6150	In speed of foot he might not hope to vie.
6150	Then on the left let us our onset make;
6150	And quickly learn if we on others' heads
6150	"Are doom'd to win renown, or they on ours."""
6150	""
6150	He said: and, brave as Mars, Meriones,
6150	Thither where he directed, led the way.
6150	Now when, attended thus, Idomeneus,
6150	Like blazing fire, in dazzling arms appear'd,
6150	Around him throng'd, with rallying cries, the Greeks,
6150	And rag'd beside the ships the balanc'd fight.
6150	As, when the dust lies deepest on the roads,
6150	Before the boist'rous winds the storm drives fast,
6150	And high at once the whirling clouds are toss'd;
6150	So was the fight confus'd; and in the throng
6150	Each man with keen desire of slaughter burn'd.
6150	Bristled the deadly strife with pond'rous spears,
6150	Wielded with dire intent; the brazen gleam
6150	Dazzled the sight, by flashing helmets cast,
6150	And breastplates polish'd bright, and glitt'ring shields
6150	Commingling; stern of heart indeed were he,
6150	Who on that sight with joy, not pain, could gaze.
6150	""
6150	Dire evil then on mortal warriors brought
6150	The diverse minds of Saturn's mighty sons:
6150	To Hector and the Trojans Jove design'd,
6150	In honour of Achilles, swift of foot,
6150	To give the vict'ry; yet not utterly
6150	He will'd to slay before the walls of Troy
6150	The Grecian host; but glory to confer
6150	On Thetis and her noble-minded son.
6150	Neptune, on th' other side, the Greeks inspir'd,
6150	Clandestine rising from the hoary sea;
6150	For them before the Trojan host o'erborne
6150	He saw with grief, and deeply wroth with Jove.
6150	Equal the rank of both, their birth the same,
6150	But Jove in wisdom, as in years, the first.
6150	Nor ventur'd Neptune openly to aid
6150	The cause of Greece; but cloth'd in mortal form,
6150	In secret still the army's courage rous'd.
6150	This way and that they tugg'd of furious war
6150	And balanc'd strife, where many a warrior fell,
6150	The straining rope, which none might break or loose.
6150	Then, though his hair was grizzl'd o'er with age,
6150	Calling the Greeks to aid, Idomeneus,
6150	Inspiring terror, on the Trojans sprang,
6150	And slew Othryoneus, who but of late
6150	Came from Cabesus on the alarm of war;
6150	And, welcomed as a guest in Priam's house,
6150	The fairest of his daughters sought to wed,
6150	No portion asked, Cassandra; mighty deeds
6150	He promis'd, from before the walls of Troy
6150	In their despite to drive the sons of Greece.
6150	The aged Priam listen'd to his snit;
6150	And he, his promise trusting, fought for Troy.
6150	Him, marching with proud step, Idomeneus
6150	Struck with his glitt'ring spear, nor aught avail'd
6150	His brazen breastplate; through the middle thrust,
6150	Thund'ring he fell: the victor vaunting cried:
6150	""
6150	"""Othryoneus, above all mortal men"
6150	I hold thee in respect, if thou indeed
6150	Wilt make thy words to aged Priam good,
6150	Who promis'd thee his daughter in return:
6150	We too would offer thee a like reward;
6150	And give thee here to wed, from Argos brought,
6150	Atrides' fairest daughter, if with us
6150	Thou wilt o'erthrow the well-built walls of Troy.
6150	Come then, on board our ocean-going ships
6150	Discuss the marriage contract; nor shall we
6150	"Be found illib'ral of our bridal gifts."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and seizing by the foot the slain,
6150	Dragg'd from the press; but to the rescue came
6150	Asius, himself on foot before his car:
6150	So close his charioteer the horses held,
6150	They breath'd upon his shoulders; eagerly
6150	He sought to reach Idomeneus; but he,
6150	Preventing, through his gullet drove the spear,
6150	Beneath his chin; right through the weapon pass'd;
6150	He fell; as falls an oak, or poplar tall,
6150	Or lofty pine, which on the mountain top,
6150	For some proud ship, the woodman's axe hath hewn:
6150	So he, before the car and horses stretch'd,
6150	His death-cry utt'ring, clutch'd the blood-stain'd soil;
6150	Bewilder'd, helpless, stood his charioteer;
6150	Nor dar'd, escaping from the foemen's hands,
6150	To turn his horses: him, Antilochus
6150	Beneath the waistband struck; nor aught avail'd
6150	His brazen breastplate; through the middle thrust,
6150	He, from the well-wrought chariot, gasping, fell.
6150	Antilochus, the noble Nestor's son,
6150	The horses seiz'd, and from the Trojan ranks
6150	Drove to the Grecian camp. For Asius' death
6150	Deep griev'd, Deiphobus, approaching, hurl'd
6150	Against Idomeneus his glitt'ring spear:
6150	The coming weapon he beheld, and shunn'd:
6150	Beneath the ample circle of his shield,
6150	With hides and brazen plates encircled round,
6150	And by two rods sustain'd, conceal'd he stood:
6150	Beneath he crouch'd, and o'er him flew the spear:
6150	Yet harsh it grated, glancing from the shield;
6150	Nor bootless from that stalwart hand it flew,
6150	But through the midriff, close below the heart,
6150	Hypsenor, son of Hippasus, it struck,
6150	And straight relax'd his limbs; then shouting loud,
6150	In boastful tone, Deiphobus exclaim'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Not unaveng'd lies Asius; he, methinks,"
6150	As I have found him fellowship, with joy
6150	"Thro' Hades' strongly-guarded gates may pass."""
6150	He said; the Greeks, indignant, heard his boast;
6150	Chief, of Antilochus the manly soul
6150	Was stirr'd within him; yet amid his grief
6150	His comrade not forgetting, up he ran,
6150	And o'er him spread the cover of his shield.
6150	Meanwhile, two trusty friends, Mecistheus, son
6150	Of Echius, and Alastor, rais'd the slain,
6150	And deeply groaning bore him to the ships.
6150	Nor did Idomeneus his noble rage
6150	Abate; still burning o'er some Trojan soul
6150	To draw the gloomy veil of night and death;
6150	Or, having sav'd the Greeks, himself to fall.
6150	Then high-born AEsuetes' son he slew,
6150	Alcathous; he, Anchises' son-in-law,
6150	The eldest of his daughters had to wife,
6150	Hippodamia; by her parents both,
6150	O'er all, belov'd; in beauty, skill, and mind,
6150	All her compeers surpassing; wife of one,
6150	The noblest man through all the breadth of Troy.
6150	Him Neptune by Idomeneus subdued;
6150	Seal'd his quick eyes, his active limbs restrain'd,
6150	Without the pow'r to fly, or shun the spear;
6150	Fix'd as a pillar, or a lofty tree,
6150	He stood, while through his breast Idomeneus
6150	His weapon drove; the brazen mail it broke,
6150	Which oft had turn'd aside the stroke of death;
6150	Harshly it grated, sever'd by the spear:
6150	He fell; the spear-point quiv'ring in his heart,
6150	Which with convulsive throbbings shook the shaft.
6150	There Mars its course arrested. Then with shouts
6150	Of triumph, vaunting, thus Idomeneus:
6150	""
6150	"""How now, Deiphobus? are three for one"
6150	An equal balance? where are now thy boasts?
6150	Come forth, my friend, thyself to me oppos'd;
6150	And learn, if here, unworthy my descent
6150	From Jove, my great progenitor, I stand.
6150	He Minos, guardian chief of Crete, begot;
6150	Noble Deucalion was to Minos born,
6150	I to Deucalion; far extends my rule
6150	In wide-spread Crete; whom now our ships have brought,
6150	"A bane to thee, thy sire, and Trojans all."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and doubtful stood Deiphobus,
6150	Or to retreat, and summon to his aid
6150	The Trojans, or alone the venture try.
6150	Thus as he mus'd, the wiser course appear'd
6150	To seek AEneas; him he found apart,
6150	Behind the crowd; for he was still at feud
6150	With godlike Priam, who, he thought, withheld
6150	The public honour to his valour due.
6150	To whom Deiphobus, approaching, thus:
6150	""
6150	"""AEneas, sagest councillor of Troy,"
6150	Behoves thee now, if rev'rence for the dead
6150	Can move thy soul, thy sister's husband aid:
6150	Haste we to save Alcathous; who of old,
6150	When thou wast little, in thy father's house,
6150	Nurs'd thee with tender care; for him, but now,
6150	"The spear-renown'd Idomeneus hath slain."""
6150	""
6150	He said; AEneas' spirit was rous'd, and fill'd
6150	With martial rage he sought Idomeneus.
6150	Nor, cowardlike, did he th' encounter shun;
6150	But firmly stood, as stands a mountain-boar
6150	Self-confident, that in some lonely spot
6150	Awaits the clam'rous chase; bristles his back;
6150	His eyes with fire are flashing; and his tusks
6150	He whets, on men and dogs prepar'd to rush:
6150	So stood the spear-renown'd Idomeneus,
6150	The onset of AEneas, swift in fight,
6150	Awaiting; and the friends he saw around
6150	He summon'd to his aid; Ascalaphus,
6150	Deipyrus, and brave Meriones,
6150	Antilochus and Aphareus; to these,
6150	Tried warriors all, he thus addressed his speech:
6150	""
6150	"""Aid me, my friends! alone I stand, and dread"
6150	The onset of AEneas, swift of foot.
6150	Mighty to slay in battle; and the bloom
6150	Of youth is his, the crown of human strength;
6150	If, as our spirit, our years were but the same,
6150	"Great glory now should he, or I, obtain."""
6150	He said; and, one in heart, their bucklers slop'd
6150	Upon their shoulders, all beside him stood.
6150	""
6150	On th' other side, AEneas to his aid
6150	Summon'd his brother chiefs, Deiphobus,
6150	And Paris, and Agenor; following whom
6150	Came on the gen'ral crowd; as flocks of sheep
6150	From pasture follow to their drinking-place
6150	The lordly ram; well pleas'd the shepherd sees;
6150	So pleas'd, AEneas saw the gath'ring crowd.
6150	Then o'er Alcathous hand to hand was wag'd
6150	The war of spears; dire was the clash of brass
6150	Upon the heroes' breasts, as 'mid the press
6150	Each aim'd at other; proudly eminent
6150	Stood forth two mighty warriors, terrible
6150	As Mars, AEneas and Idomeneus,
6150	Their sharp spears wielding each at other's life.
6150	First at Idomeneus AEneas threw
6150	His spear; he saw, and shunn'd the brazen point;
6150	And vainly from his stalwart hand dismiss'd,
6150	AEneas' spear stood quiv'ring in the ground.
6150	Idomeneus in front, below the waist,
6150	OEnomaus struck; the weighty spear broke through
6150	The hollow breastplate, and th' intestines tore;
6150	Prone in the dust he fell, and clutch'd the ground.
6150	Forthwith Idomeneus from out the corpse
6150	The pond'rous spear withdrew; yet could not strip
6150	His armour off; so thickly flew the spears.
6150	Nor did his feet retain their youthful force,
6150	His weapon to regain, or back to spring.
6150	Skill'd in the standing fight his life to guard,
6150	He lack'd the active pow'r of swift retreat.
6150	At him, retiring slow, Deiphobus,
6150	Still fill'd with anger, threw his glitt'ring spear:
6150	His aim he miss'd; but through the shoulder pierc'd
6150	Ascalaphus, a valiant son of Mars;
6150	Prone in the dust he fell, and clutch'd the ground.
6150	Nor knew the loud-voic'd, mighty God of War
6150	That in the stubborn fight his son had fall'n;
6150	On high Olympus, girt with golden clouds,
6150	He sat, amid th' Immortals all, restrain'd,
6150	By Jove's commands, from mingling in the war.
6150	How hand to hand around Ascalaphus
6150	Rag'd the fierce conflict: first Deiphobus
6150	From off his head the glitt'ring helmet tore;
6150	But, terrible as Mars, Meriones
6150	Sprang forth, and pierc'd his arm; and from his hand
6150	With hollow sound the crested helmet fell.
6150	On, like a vulture, sprang Meriones,
6150	And from his arm the sturdy spear withdrew;
6150	Then backward leap'd amid his comrades' ranks;
6150	While round his brother's waist Polites threw
6150	His arms, and led him from the battle-field
6150	To where, with charioteer and rich-wrought car,
6150	Beyond the fight, his flying coursers stood.
6150	Him, rack'd with pain, and groaning, while the blood
6150	Stream'd down his wounded arm, to Troy they bore.
6150	The rest fought on, and loud the tumult rose.
6150	""
6150	AEneas through the throat of Aphareus,
6150	Caletor's son, turn'd sideways tow'rds him, drove
6150	His glitt'ring spear; and down on th' other side,
6150	His shield and helmet following, sank his head;
6150	And o'er his eyes were cast the shades of death.
6150	As Thoon turn'd, Antilochus, who watch'd
6150	Th' occasion, forward sprang, and with his spear
6150	Ripp'd all the flesh that lay along the spine
6150	Up to the neck; he backward fell, with hands
6150	Uplifted calling for his comrades' aid:
6150	But forward sprang Antilochus, and tore
6150	His armour from his breast, while round he cast
6150	His watchful glances; for on ev'ry side
6150	On his broad shield the Trojans show'r'd their blows,
6150	But touch'd him not; for Neptune, 'mid the throng
6150	Of weapons, threw his guard o'er Nestor's son.
6150	Yet not aloof he stood, but in their midst,
6150	Commingled; nor held motionless his spear;
6150	But ever threat'ning, turn'd from side to side,
6150	Prepar'd to hurl, or hand to hand engage.
6150	Him Adamas, the son of Asius, marked,
6150	As o'er the crowd he glanc'd; and springing forth,
6150	Struck with his spear the centre of the shield;
6150	But dark-hair'd Neptune grudg'd the hero's life,
6150	And stay'd the brazen point; half in the shield,
6150	Like a fire-harden'd stake, remained infix'd,
6150	The other half lay broken, on the ground.
6150	Back to his comrades' shelt'ring ranks he sprang,
6150	In hope of safety; but Meriones,
6150	Quick-following, plung'd his weapon through his groin,
6150	Where sharpest agony to wretched men
6150	Attends on death; there planted he his spear:
6150	Around the shaft he writh'd, and gasping groan'd,
6150	Like to a mountain bull, which, bound with cords,
6150	The herdsmen drag along, with struggles vain,
6150	Resisting; so the wounded warrior groan'd:
6150	But not for long: for fierce Meriones,
6150	Approaching, from his body tore the spear,
6150	And the dark shades of death his eyes o'erspread.
6150	Then Helenus, a weighty Thracian sword
6150	Wielding aloft, across the temples smote
6150	Deipyrus, and all his helmet crash'd;
6150	Which, as it roll'd beneath their feet, some Greek
6150	Seiz'd 'mid the press; his eyes were clos'd in death.
6150	The valiant Menelaus, Atreus' son,
6150	With grief beheld; and royal Helenus
6150	With threat'ning mien approaching, pois'd on high
6150	His glitt'ring spear, while he the bowstring drew.
6150	Then simultaneous flew from either side
6150	The gleaming spear, and arrow from the string.
6150	The shaft of Priam's son below the breast
6150	The hollow cuirass struck, and bounded off;
6150	As bound the dark-skinn'd beans, or clatt'ring peas,
6150	From the broad fan upon the threshing-floor,
6150	By the brisk breeze impell'd, and winnower's force;
6150	From noble Menelaus' cuirass so
6150	The stinging arrow bounding, glanc'd afar.
6150	But valiant Menelaus, Atreus' son,
6150	Transfix'd the hand that held the polish'd bow:
6150	The brazen point pass'd through, and to the bow
6150	The hand was pinn'd; back to his comrades' ranks
6150	He sprang, in hope of safety, hanging down
6150	The wounded limb, that trail'd the ashen spear.
6150	Agenor from the wound the spear withdrew,
6150	And with a twisted sling of woollen cloth,
6150	By an attendant brought, bound up the hand.
6150	To noble Menelaus stood oppos'd
6150	Peisander, to the confines dark of death
6150	Led by his evil fate, by thee to fall,
6150	Great son of Atreus, in the deadly strife.
6150	When near they drew, Atrides miss'd his aim,
6150	With erring spear divergent; next his shield
6150	Peisander struck, but drove not through the spear;
6150	For the broad shield resisted, and the shaft
6150	Was snapp'd in sunder: Menelaus saw
6150	Rejoicing, and with hope of triumph flush'd;
6150	Unsheathing then his silver-studded sword
6150	Rush'd on Peisander; he beneath his shield
6150	Drew forth a pond'rous brazen battle-axe,
6150	With handle long, of polish'd olive-wood:
6150	And both at once in deadly combat join'd.
6150	Then, just below the plume, Peisander struck
6150	The crested helmet's peak; but Atreus' son
6150	Met him advancing, and across the brow
6150	Smote him, above the nose; loud crash'd the bone,
6150	And in the dust the gory eyeballs dropp'd
6150	Before him; doubled with the pain, he fell:
6150	The victor, planting on his chest his foot,
6150	Stripp'd off his arms, and thus exulting cried:
6150	"""Thus shall ye all, insatiate of the fight,"
6150	Proud Trojans, from before our ships depart;
6150	Nor lack your share of insult and of wrong,
6150	Such as on me, vile hounds, ye cast erewhile,
6150	Nor fear'd th' avenger of the slighted laws
6150	Of hospitality, high thund'ring Jove,
6150	Who soon your lofty city shall o'erthrow.
6150	Kindly receiv'd, my virgin-wedded wife,
6150	With store of goods, ye basely bore away;
6150	And now ye rage, infuriate, to destroy
6150	With fire our ocean-going ships, and slay
6150	Our Grecian heroes; but the time shall come
6150	When ye too fain would from the war escape.
6150	O Father Jove, 'tis said that thou excell'st,
6150	In wisdom, Gods and men; all human things
6150	From thee proceed; and can it be, that thou
6150	With favour seest these men of violence,
6150	These Trojans, with presumptuous courage fill'd,
6150	Whose rage for the battle knows nor stint nor bound?
6150	Men are with all things sated; sleep and love;
6150	Sweet sounds of music, and the joyous dance.
6150	Of these may some more gladly take their fill;
6150	"But Trojans still for war, instiate, thirst."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Menelaus; and the blood-stained arms
6150	Stripp'd from the corpse, and to his comrades gave;
6150	Then join'd again the foremost in the fray.
6150	There to th' encounter forth Harpalion sprang,
6150	Son of the King Pylaemenes, who came,
6150	His father following, to the war of Troy,
6150	But back return'd not to his native land.
6150	He standing near, full in the centre struck
6150	Atrides' shield, but drove not through the spear;
6150	Back to his comrades' shelt'ring ranks he sprang
6150	In hopes of safety, glancing all around,
6150	His body to defend; but as he turn'd,
6150	In his right flank a brazen-pointed shaft,
6150	Shot by Meriones, was buried deep:
6150	Beneath the bone it pass'd, and pierc'd him through.
6150	At once he fell; and gasping out his life,
6150	Amid his comrades, writhing on the ground
6150	Like a crush'd worm he lay; and from the wound
6150	The dark blood pouring, drench'd the thirsty soil.
6150	""
6150	The valiant troops of Paphlagonia clos'd
6150	Around him; on his car they plac'd the slain.
6150	And deeply sorrowing, to the city bore;
6150	His father, weeping, walk'd beside the car,                     [4]
6150	Nor vengeance for his slaughter'd son obtain'd.
6150	Paris with grief and anger saw him fall:
6150	For he in former days his guest had been
6150	In Paphlagonia; then, with anger fill'd,
6150	A brass-tipp'd arrow from his bow he sent.
6150	""
6150	A certain man there was, Euchenor nam'd,
6150	Who dwelt in Corinth; rich, of blameless life,
6150	The son of Polyeidus, skilful seer:
6150	His fate well knowing, he embark'd; for oft
6150	The good old man had told him that his doom
6150	Was, or at home by sharp disease to die,
6150	Or with the Greeks by Trojan hands to fall.
6150	Embarking, he escap'd alike the fine
6150	By Greeks impos'd, and pangs of sharp disease.
6150	Him Paris smote between the ear and jaw;
6150	Swift fled his spirit, and darkness clos'd his eyes.
6150	Thus rag'd, like blazing fire, the furious fight.
6150	""
6150	But nought as yet had Hector heard, nor knew
6150	How sorely, leftward of the ships, were press'd
6150	The Trojans by the Greeks; and now appear'd
6150	Their triumph, sure; such succour Neptune gave,
6150	Their courage rousing, and imparting strength.
6150	But there he kept, where first the serried ranks
6150	Of Greeks he broke, and storm'd the wall and gates;
6150	There beach'd beside the hoary sea, the ships
6150	Of Ajax and Protesilaus lay;
6150	There had the wall been lowest built; and there
6150	Were gather'd in defence the chiefest all,
6150	Horses and men: the stout Boeotians there,
6150	Join'd to th' Ionians with their flowing robes,
6150	Loerians, and Phthians, and Epeians proud,
6150	Could scarce protect their ships; nor could repel
6150	Th' impetuous fire of godlike Hector's charge.
6150	There too the choicest troops of Athens fought;
6150	Their chief, Menestheus, Peteus' son; with whom
6150	Were Pheidas, Stichius, Bias in command;
6150	Th' Epeians Meges, Phyleus' son, obey'd,
6150	And Dracius and Amphion; Medon next,
6150	With brave Podarces led the Phthian host:
6150	Medon, the great Oileus' bastard son,
6150	Brother of Ajax; he in Phylace,
6150	Far from his native land, was driv'n to dwell,
6150	Since one to Eriopis near akin,
6150	His sire Oileus' wife, his hand had slain.
6150	Podarces from Iphiclus claim'd his birth,
6150	The son of Phylacus; these two in arms
6150	The valiant Phthians leading to the fight,
6150	Join'd the Boeotian troops to guard the ships.
6150	But from the side of Ajax Telamon
6150	Stirr'd not a whit Oileus' active son;
6150	But as on fallow-land with one accord,
6150	Two dark-red oxen drag the well-wrought plough,
6150	Streaming with sweat that gathers round their horns;
6150	They by the polish'd yoke together held,
6150	The stiff soil cleaving, down the furrow strain;
6150	So closely, side by side, those two advanc'd.
6150	But comrades, many and brave, on Telamon
6150	Attended, who, whene'er with toil and sweat
6150	His limbs grew faint, upheld his weighty shield;
6150	While in the fray, Oileus' noble son
6150	No Locrians follow'd; theirs were not the hearts
6150	To brook th' endurance of the standing fight;
6150	Nor had they brass-bound helms, with horsehair plume,
6150	Nor ample shields they bore, nor ashen spear;
6150	But came to Troy, in bows and twisted slings
6150	Of woollen cloth confiding; and from these
6150	Their bolts quick-show'ring, broke the Trojan ranks.
6150	While those, in front, in glitt'ring arms oppos'd
6150	The men of Troy, by noble Hector led:
6150	These, in the rear, unseen, their arrows shot.
6150	Nor stood the Trojans; for amid their ranks
6150	The galling arrows dire confusion spread.
6150	Then had the Trojans from the ships and tents
6150	Back to the breezy heights of Troy been driv'n
6150	In flight disastrous; but Polydamas
6150	Drew near to Hector, and address'd him thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, I know thee, how unapt thou art"
6150	To hearken to advice; because the Gods
6150	Have giv'n thee to excel in warlike might,
6150	Thou deemest thyself, in counsel too, supreme;
6150	Yet every gift thou canst not so combine:
6150	To one the Gods have granted warlike might,
6150	To one the dance, to one the lyre and song;
6150	While in another's breast all-seeing Jove
6150	Hath plac'd the spirit of wisdom, and a mind
6150	Discerning, for the common good of all:
6150	By him are states preserv'd; and he himself
6150	Best knows the value of the precious gift.
6150	Then hear what seems to me the wisest course.
6150	On ev'ry side the circling ring of war
6150	Is blazing all around thee; and, thou seest,
6150	Our valiant Trojans, since the wall they scal'd,
6150	Or stand aloof, or scatter'd 'mid the ships
6150	Outnumber'd, with superior forces strive.
6150	Then thou, retiring, hither call the chiefs;
6150	Here take we counsel fully, if to fall
6150	Upon their well-mann'd ships, should Heaven vouchsafe
6150	The needful strength, or, scatheless yet, withdraw;
6150	For much I fear they soon will pay us back
6150	Their debt of yesterday; since in their ranks
6150	One yet remains insatiate of the fight,
6150	"And he, methinks, not long will stand aloof."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he: the prudent counsel Hector pleas'd;
6150	Down from his chariot with his arms he leap'd,
6150	And to Polydamas his speech address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Polydamas, detain thou here the chiefs;"
6150	Thither will I, and meet the front of war,
6150	"And, giv'n my orders, quickly here return."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and, like a snow-clad mountain high,
6150	Uprose; and loudly shouting, in hot haste
6150	Flew through the Trojan and Confed'rate host.
6150	At sound of Hector's voice, round Panthous' son,
6150	Polydamas, were gather'd all the chiefs.
6150	But 'mid the foremost combatants he sought
6150	If haply he might find Deiphobus,
6150	And royal Helenus, and Adamas,
6150	And gallant Asius, son of Hyrtacus.
6150	These found he not unscath'd by wounds or death;
6150	For some beside the ships of Greece had paid,
6150	By Grecian hands, the forfeit of their lives,
6150	While others wounded lay within the wall.
6150	But, to the leftward of the bloody fray,
6150	The godlike Paris, fair-hair'd Helen's Lord,
6150	Cheering his comrades to the fight, he found,
6150	And with reproachful words address'd him thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Thou wretched Paris, fair in outward form,"
6150	Thou slave of woman, manhood's counterfeit,
6150	Where is Deiphobus, and where the might
6150	Of royal Helenus? where Adamas,
6150	The son of Asius? where too Asius, son
6150	Of Hyrtacus? and where Othryoneus?
6150	Now from its summit totters to the fall
6150	"Our lofty Ilium; now thy doom is sure."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the godlike Paris thus replied:
6150	"""Hector, since blameless I incur thy blame,"
6150	Ne'er have I less withdrawn me from the fight,
6150	And me not wholly vile my mother bore;
6150	For since thou gav'st command to attack the ships,
6150	We here against the Greeks unflinching war
6150	Have wag'd; our comrades, whom thou seek'st, are slain:
6150	Only Deiphobus hath left the field,
6150	And Helenus; both wounded by the spear,
6150	Both through the hand; but Jove their life hath spar'd.
6150	But thou, where'er thy courage bids, lead on:
6150	We shall be prompt to follow; to our pow'r
6150	Thou shalt in us no lack of valour find;
6150	"Beyond his pow'r the bravest cannot fight."""
6150	""
6150	Wrought on his brother's mind the hero's words:
6150	Together both they bent their steps, where rag'd
6150	The fiercest conflict; there Cebriones,
6150	Phalces, Orthaeus, brave Polydamas,
6150	Palmys, and godlike Polyphetes' might,
6150	And Morys, and Ascanius fought; these two
6150	Hippotion's sons; from rich Ascania's plains
6150	They, as reliefs, but yestermorn had come;
6150	Impell'd by Jove, they sought the battle field.
6150	Onward they dash'd, impetuous as the rush
6150	Of the fierce whirlwind, which with lightning charg'd,
6150	From Father Jove sweeps downward o'er the plain:
6150	As with loud roar it mingles with the sea,
6150	The many-dashing ocean's billows boil,
6150	Upheaving, foam-white-crested, wave on wave;
6150	So, rank on rank, the Trojans, closely mass'd,
6150	In arms all glitt'ring, with their chiefs advanc'd;
6150	Hector, the son of Priam, led them on,
6150	In combat terrible as blood-stain'd Mars:
6150	Before his breast his shield's broad orb he bore,
6150	Of hides close join'd, with brazen plates o'erlaid;
6150	The gleaming helmet nodded o'er his brow.
6150	He, with proud step, protected by his shield,
6150	On ev'ry side the hostile ranks survey'd,
6150	If signs of yielding he might trace; but they
6150	Unshaken stood; and with like haughty mien,
6150	Ajax at Hector thus defiance hurl'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Draw nearer, mighty chief; why seek to scare"
6150	Our valiant Greeks? we boast ourselves of war
6150	Not wholly unskill'd, though now the hand of Jove
6150	Lies heavy on us with the scourge of Heav'n.
6150	Thou hop'st, forsooth, our vessels to destroy;
6150	But stalwart arms for their defence we boast.
6150	Long ere that day shall your proud city fall,
6150	Tak'n and destroy'd by our victorious hands.
6150	Not far the hour, when thou thyself in flight
6150	To Jove and all the Gods shalt make thy pray'r,
6150	That swifter than the falcon's wing thy steeds
6150	"May bear thee o'er the dusty plain to Troy."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, upon his right appear'd
6150	An eagle, soaring high; the crowd of Greeks
6150	The fav'ring omen saw, and shouted loud:
6150	"Then noble Hector thus: ""What words are these,"
6150	Ajax, thou babbling braggart, vain of speech!
6150	For would to Heav'n I were as well assur'd
6150	I were the son of aegis-bearing Jove,
6150	Born of imperial Juno, and myself
6150	In equal honour with Apollo held
6150	Or blue-ey'd Pallas, as I am assur'd
6150	This day is fraught with ill to all the Greeks:
6150	Thou 'mid the rest shalt perish, if thou dare
6150	My spear encounter, which thy dainty skin
6150	Shall rend; and slain beside the ships, thy flesh
6150	"Shall glut the dogs and carrion birds of Troy."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and led them on; with eager cheers
6150	They followed; shouted loud the hindmost throng.
6150	On th' other side the Greeks return'd the shout:
6150	Of all the Trojans' bravest they, unmov'd,
6150	The onset bore; their mingled clamours rose
6150	To Heav'n, and reach'd the glorious light of Jove.

6150	JUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the
6150	increasing clamour of the war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his way he
6150	meets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the
6150	extremity of the danger. Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by
6150	night, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that,
6150	wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with
6150	their presence; which advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of
6150	Jupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to overreach him; she sets off
6150	her charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchant him)
6150	obtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to the god
6150	of Sleep, and with some difficulty persuades him to seal the eyes of
6150	Jupiter; this done, she goes to Mount Ida, where the god at first
6150	sight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid
6150	asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the
6150	Greeks; Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax,
6150	and carried off from the battle; several actions succeed; till the
6150	Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way; the lesser Ajax
6150	signalizes himself in a particular manner.

6150	Nor did the battle-din not reach the ears
6150	Of Nestor, o'er the wine-cup; and his speech
6150	He thus address'd to AEsculapius' son:
6150	""
6150	"""Say, good Machaon, what these sounds may mean;"
6150	For louder swells the tumult round the ships.
6150	But sit thou here, and drink the ruddy wine,

6150	""
6150	He said, and from the wall a buckler took,
6150	Well-wrought, with brass resplendent, which his son,
6150	Brave Thrasymedes, in the tent had left,
6150	While with his father's shield himself was girt;
6150	A sturdy spear too, tipp'd with brass, he took:
6150	Without the tent he stood; and there his eyes
6150	A woful sight beheld; the Greeks in flight,
6150	The haughty Trojans pressing on their rout
6150	Confus'd; the Greeks' protecting wall o'erthrown.
6150	As heaves the darkling sea with silent swell,
6150	Expectant of the boist'rous gale's approach;
6150	Nor onward either way is pour'd its flood,
6150	Until it feel th' impelling blast from Heav'n;
6150	So stood th' old man, his mind perplex'd with doubt,
6150	To mingle in the throng, or counsel seek
6150	Of mighty Agamemnon, Atreus' son.
6150	Thus as he mused, the better course appear'd,
6150	To seek Atrides; fiercely fought the rest
6150	With mutual slaughter; loud their armour rang
6150	With thrusts of swords and double-pointed spears.
6150	There Nestor met, advancing from the ships,
6150	The Heav'n-born Kings, Ulysses, Diomed,
6150	And Agamemnon, son of Atreus, all
6150	By wounds disabled; for the ships were beach'd
6150	Upon the shore, beside the hoary sea,
6150	Far from the battle; higher, tow'rd the plain
6150	The foremost had been drawn, and with a wall
6150	Their sterns surrounded; for the spacious beach
6150	Could not contain them, and in narrow bounds
6150	Were pent their multitudes; so high on land
6150	They drew, and rang'd them side by side, and fill'd,
6150	Within the headlands, all the wide-mouth'd bay.
6150	Thus they, their steps supporting on their spears,
6150	Together came, spectators of the fight;
6150	Deep sorrow fill'd their breasts; them Nestor met,
6150	The fear increasing, which their souls possess'd.
6150	To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
6150	""
6150	"""O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece,"
6150	Why com'st thou here, and leav'st the battle-field?
6150	Greatly I fear that noble Hector now
6150	His menace will fulfil, who made his boast
6150	Before th' assembled Trojans, that to Troy
6150	He never would return, until our ships
6150	The flames had master'd, and ourselves the sword.
6150	Such was his threat, and now he makes it good.
6150	Heav'n! can it be that I of other Greeks,
6150	As of Achilles, have incurr'd the wrath,
6150	"Who thence refuse to battle for the ships?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
6150	"""Such are indeed our prospects; Jove on high"
6150	Could to our fortunes give no diff'rent turn.
6150	The wall is raz'd, wherein our trust we plac'd
6150	To guard, impregnable, ourselves and ships;
6150	And now around the ships their war they wage,
6150	Unceasing, unabated; none might tell
6150	By closest scrutiny, which way are driv'n
6150	The routed Greeks, so intermix'd they fall
6150	Promiscuous; and the cry ascends to Heav'n.
6150	But come, discuss we what may best be done,
6150	If judgment aught may profit us; ourselves
6150	To mingle in the fray I counsel not;
6150	"It were not well for wounded men to fight."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd Agamemnon, King of men:
6150	"""Nestor, since to the ships the war is brought,"
6150	Nor hath the wall avail'd to stay their course,
6150	Nor yet the deep-dug trench, on which we Greeks
6150	Much toil bestow'd, and which we vainly hop'd
6150	Might guard, impregnable, ourselves and ships;
6150	Seems it the will of Saturn's mighty son
6150	That, far from Argos, from our native land,
6150	We all should here in nameless graves be laid.
6150	I knew when once he lov'd to aid the Greeks;
6150	But now I see that to the blessed Gods
6150	Our foes he equals, and our strength confounds.
6150	Hear then my counsel; let us all agree
6150	The ships that nearest to the sea are beach'd
6150	To launch upon the main, till nightfall there
6150	To ride at anchor: if that e'en by night
6150	The Trojans may suspend their fierce assault;
6150	Then may we launch in safety all the fleet.
6150	No shame it is to fly, although by night,
6150	Impending evil; better so to fly
6150	"Than by the threaten'd danger be o'erta'en."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, with scornful glance, Ulysses sage:
6150	"""What words have pass'd the barrier of thy lips,"
6150	Thou son of Atreus? counsellor of ill!
6150	Would thou hadst been of some ignoble band
6150	The leader, not the chief of such a host
6150	As ours, on whom, from youth to latest age,
6150	Jove hath the gift bestow'd, to bear the brunt
6150	Of hardy war, till ev'ry man be slain.
6150	And think'st thou so to leave the lofty walls
6150	Of Troy, the object of our painful toil?
6150	Be silent, that no other Greek may hear
6150	Words, which no man might trust his tongue to speak,
6150	Who nobler counsels understands, and wields
6150	A royal sceptre, and th' allegiance claims
6150	Of numbers, such as those that own thy sway.
6150	Thy counsels all I utterly condemn;
6150	Who, 'mid the close and clamour of the fight,
6150	Wouldst have us launch our ships, and give the foe,
6150	Already too triumphant, cause renew'd
6150	For boasting; then were death our certain lot;
6150	For, if the ships he launch'd, not long will Greeks
6150	Sustain the war, but with reverted eyes
6150	Shrink from the fight; to such pernicious end
6150	"Would lead thy baneful counsels, mighty chief."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd Agamemnon, King of men:
6150	"""Ulysses, thy rebuke hath wrung my soul;"
6150	Yet never meant I, that against their will
6150	The sons of Greece should launch their well found ships:
6150	But if there be who better counsel knows,
6150	"Or young or old, his words would please me well."""
6150	""
6150	Then rose the valiant Diomed, and said:
6150	"""The man is near at hand, nor far to seek,"
6150	If ye will hear, nor take offence, that I,
6150	The youngest of you all, presume to speak.
6150	Yet of a noble sire I boast me sprung,
6150	Tydeus, who sleeps beneath the Theban soil:
6150	To Portheus three brave sons were born, who dwelt
6150	In Pleuron and in lofty Calydon,
6150	Agrius, and Melas; bravest of them all,
6150	My father's father, OEneus, was the third.
6150	He there remain'd; my father, wand'ring long,
6150	To Argos came; such was the will of Jove
6150	And of th' Immortals all; he there espous'd
6150	Adrastus' daughter; own'd a wealthy house,
6150	With fertile corn-lands round, and orchards stor'd
6150	With goodly fruit-trees; num'rous flocks he had,
6150	And all the Greeks in feats of arms excell'd.
6150	Hear ye the words I speak, for they are true:
6150	And if my speech be wise, despise it not,
6150	As of one worthless, or ignobly born.
6150	Though wounded, to the battle I advise
6150	That we perforce repair; yet not ourselves
6150	To join the combat, or confront the spears,
6150	Lest wounds to wounds be added; but to rouse
6150	The spirits of some, who, zealous heretofore,
6150	"How stand aloof, nor mingle in the fray."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and they, his words approving, went,
6150	By Agamemnon led, the King of men.
6150	Nor careless was the watch by Neptune kept:
6150	With them, in likeness of an aged man,
6150	He went, and Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
6150	By the right hand he took, and thus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""O son of Atreus, great is now the joy"
6150	With which Achilles' savage breast is fill'd,
6150	Who sees the slaughter and the rout of Greeks:
6150	For nought he has of heart, no, not a whit:
6150	But perish he, accursed of the Gods!
6150	Nor deem thou that to thee the blessed Gods
6150	Are wholly hostile; yet again the chiefs
6150	And councillors of Troy shall scour in flight
6150	The dusty plain; and from the ships and tents
6150	"Thine eyes shall see them to the city fly."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and loudly shouting, onward rush'd.
6150	As of nine thousand or ten thousand men,
6150	In deadly combat meeting, is the shout;
6150	Such was the sound which from his ample chest
6150	Th' Earth-shaker sent; and ev'ry Greek inspir'd
6150	With stern resolve to wage unflinching war.
6150	""
6150	Standing on high Olympus' topmost peak,
6150	The golden-throned Juno downward look'd,
6150	And, busied in the glory-giving strife,
6150	Her husband's brother and her own she saw,
6150	Saw, and rejoic'd; next, seated on the crest
6150	Of spring-abounding Ida, Jove she saw,
6150	Sight hateful in her eyes! then ponder'd deep
6150	The stag-ey'd Queen, how best she might beguile
6150	The wakeful mind of aegis-bearing Jove;
6150	And, musing, this appear'd the readiest mode:
6150	Herself with art adorning, to repair
6150	To Ida; there, with fondest blandishment
6150	And female charm, her husband to enfold
6150	In love's embrace; and gentle, careless sleep
6150	Around his eyelids and his senses pour.
6150	Her chamber straight she sought, by Vulcan built,
6150	Her son; by whom were to the door-posts hung
6150	Close-fitting doors, with secret keys secur'd,
6150	That, save herself, no God might enter in.
6150	There enter'd she, and clos'd the shining doors;
6150	And with ambrosia first her lovely skin
6150	She purified, with fragrant oil anointing,
6150	Ambrosial, breathing forth such odours sweet,
6150	That, wav'd above the brazen floor of Jove,
6150	All earth and Heav'n were with the fragrance fill'd;
6150	O'er her fair skin this precious oil she spread;
6150	Comb'd out her flowing locks, and with her hand
6150	Wreath'd the thick masses of the glossy hair,
6150	Immortal, bright, that crown'd th' imperial head.
6150	A robe ambrosial then, by Pallas wrought,
6150	She donn'd, in many a curious pattern trac'd,
6150	With golden brooch beneath her breast confin'd.
6150	Her zone, from which a hundred tassels hung,
6150	She girt about her; and, in three bright drops,
6150	Her glitt'ring gems suspended from her ears;
6150	And all around her grace and beauty shone.
6150	Then o'er her head th' imperial Goddess threw
6150	A beauteous veil, new-wrought, as sunlight white;
6150	And on her well-turn'd feet her sandals bound.
6150	Her dress completed, from her chamber forth
6150	She issued, and from th' other Gods apart
6150	She call'd to Venus, and address'd her thus:
6150	"""Say, wilt thou grant, dear child, the boon I ask?"
6150	Or wilt thou say me nay, in wrath that I
6150	"Espouse the Greek, as thou the Trojan cause?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom the laughter-loving Venus thus:
6150	"""Daughter of Saturn, Juno, mighty Queen,"
6150	Tell me thy wish; to grant it if my pow'r
6150	"May aught avail, thy pleasure shall be done."""
6150	""
6150	To whom great Juno thus, with artful speech:
6150	"""Give me the loveliness, and pow'r to charm,"
6150	Whereby thou reign'st o'er Gods and men supreme.
6150	For to the bounteous Earth's extremest bounds
6150	I go, to visit old Oceanus,
6150	The sire of Gods, and Tethys, who of yore
6150	From Rhaea took me, when all-seeing Jove
6150	Hurl'd Saturn down below the earth and seas,
6150	And nurs'd me in their home with tend'rest care;
6150	I go to visit them, and reconcile
6150	A lengthen'd feud; for since some cause of wrath
6150	Has come between them, they from rites of love
6150	And from the marriage-bed have long abstain'd:
6150	Could I unite them by persuasive words,
6150	And to their former intercourse restore,
6150	"Their love and rev'rence were for ever mine."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the laughter-loving Queen:
6150	"""I ought not, and I cannot, say thee nay,"
6150	"Who liest encircled by the arms of Jove."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Venus spoke; and from her bosom loos'd
6150	Her broider'd cestus, wrought with ev'ry charm
6150	To win the heart; there Love, there young Desire,
6150	There fond Discourse, and there Persuasion dwelt,
6150	Which oft enthralls the mind of wisest men.
6150	This in her hand she plac'd, as thus she spoke:
6150	"""Take thou from me, and in thy bosom hide,"
6150	This broider'd cestus; and, whate'er thy wish,
6150	"Thou shalt not here ungratified return."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Venus; smil'd the stag-ey'd Queen of Heav'n,
6150	And, smiling, in her bosom hid the gift.
6150	Then Venus to her father's house return'd;
6150	But Juno down from high Olympus sped;
6150	O'er sweet Emathia, and Pieria's range,
6150	O'er snowy mountains of horse-breeding Thrace,
6150	Their topmost heights, she soar'd, nor touch'd the earth.
6150	From Athos then she cross'd the swelling sea,
6150	Until to Lemnos, godlike Thoas' seat,
6150	She came; there met she Sleep, twin-born with Death,
6150	Whom, as his hand she clasp'd, she thus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Sleep, universal King of Gods and men,"
6150	If ever thou hast listen'd to my voice,
6150	Grant me the boon which now I ask, and win
6150	My ceaseless favour in all time to come.
6150	When Jove thou seest in my embraces lock'd,
6150	Do thou his piercing eyes in slumber seal.
6150	Rich guerdon shall be thine; a gorgeous throne,
6150	Immortal, golden; which my skilful son,
6150	Vulcan, shall deftly frame; beneath, a stool
6150	"Whereon at feasts thy feet may softly rest."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the gentle God of Sleep:
6150	"""Daughter of Saturn, Juno, mighty Queen,"
6150	On any other of th' immortal Gods
6150	I can with ease exert my slumb'rous pow'r;
6150	Even to the stream of old Oceanus,
6150	Prime origin of all; but Saturn's son,
6150	Imperial Jove, I dare not so approach,
6150	Nor sink in sleep, save by his own desire.
6150	Already once, obeying thy command,
6150	A fearful warning I receiv'd, that day
6150	When from the capture and the sack of Troy
6150	That mighty warrior, son of Jove, set sail;
6150	For, circumfus'd around, with sweet constraint
6150	I bound the sense of aegis-bearing Jove,
6150	While thou, with ill-design, rousing the force
6150	Of winds tempestuous o'er the stormy sea,
6150	Didst cast him forth on Coos' thriving isle,
6150	Far from his friends; then Jove, awaking, pour'd
6150	His wrath, promiscuous, on th' assembled Gods;
6150	Me chief his anger sought; and from on high
6150	Had hurl'd me, plung'd beneath th' unfathom'd sea,
6150	But Night, the vanquisher of Gods and men,
6150	Her fugitive received me; he his wrath
6150	Repress'd, unwilling to invade the claims
6150	Of holy Night; and now thou fain wouldst urge
6150	"That I another reckless deed essay."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the stag-ey'd Queen of Heav'n:
6150	"""Why, Sleep, with thoughts like these perplex thy mind"
6150	Think'st thou that Jove as ardently desires
6150	To aid the men of Troy, as fiercely burn'd
6150	His anger on his valiant son's behalf?
6150	Grant my request; and of the Graces one,
6150	The youngest and the fairest, have to wife,
6150	"Pasithea, whom thy love hath long pursued."""
6150	""
6150	Thus promis'd Juno; Sleep, rejoicing, heard,
6150	"And answer'd thus: ""Swear then the awful oath."
6150	Inviolable, by the stream of Styx,
6150	Thy one hand laid upon the fruitful earth,
6150	The other resting on the sparkling sea;
6150	That all the Gods who in the nether realms
6150	With Saturn dwell, may of our solemn bond
6150	Be witnesses, that of the Graces one,
6150	The youngest, fairest, I shall have to wife,
6150	"Pasithea, whom my love hath long pursued."""
6150	""
6150	He said: nor did the white-arm'd Queen refuse;
6150	She took the oath requir'd; and call'd by name
6150	On all the Titans, sub-Tartarean Gods:
6150	Then, sworn and ratified the oath, they pass'd
6150	From Lemnos, and from Imbros, veil'd in cloud,
6150	Skimming their airy way; on Lectum first,
6150	In spring-abounding Ida, nurse of beasts,
6150	The sea they left, and journey'd o'er the land,
6150	While wav'd beneath their feet the lofty woods.
6150	There Sleep, ere yet he met the eye of Jove,
6150	Remain'd; and, mounted on a lofty pine,
6150	The tallest growth of Ida, that on high
6150	Flung through the desert air its boughs to Heav'n,
6150	Amid the pine's close branches lay ensconc'd;
6150	Like to a mountain bird of shrillest note,
6150	Whom Gods the Chalcis, men the night-hawk call.
6150	Juno meanwhile to Ida's summit sped,
6150	To Gargarus; the Cloud-compeller saw;
6150	He saw, and sudden passion fir'd his soul,
6150	As when, their parents' eyes eluding, first
6150	They tasted of the secret joys of love.
6150	He rose to meet her, and address'd her thus:
6150	""
6150	"""From high Olympus, Juno, whither bound,"
6150	And how, to Ida hast thou come in haste?
6150	"For horses here or chariot hast thou none."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Juno with deceitful speech
6150	"Replied: ""To fertile earth's extremest bounds"
6150	I go, to visit old Oceanus,
6150	The sire of Gods, and Tethys, who of yore
6150	Receiv'd, and nurtur'd me with tend'rest care.
6150	I go to visit them, and reconcile
6150	A lengthen'd feud; for since some cause of wrath
6150	Has come between them, they from rites of love
6150	And from the marriage-bed have long abstain'd.
6150	Meanwhile at spring-abounding Ida's foot
6150	My horses wait me, that o'er land and sea
6150	Alike my chariot bear; on thine account
6150	From high Olympus hither have I come,
6150	Lest it displease thee, if, to thee unknown,
6150	"I sought the Ocean's deeply-flowing stream."""
6150	To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
6150	"""Juno, thy visit yet awhile defer;"
6150	And let us now in love's delights indulge:
6150	For never yet did such a flood of love
6150	For Goddess or for mortal fill my soul;
6150	Not for Ixion's beauteous wife, who bore
6150	Pirithous, sage in council as the Gods;
6150	Nor the neat-footed maiden Danae,
6150	Acrisius' daughter, her who Perseus bore,
6150	Th' observ'd of all; nor noble Phoenix' child,
6150	Who bore me Minos, and the godlike might
6150	Of Rhadamanthus; nor for Semele,
6150	Nor for Alcmena fair, of whom was born
6150	In Thebes the mighty warrior Hercules,
6150	As Bacchus, joy of men, of Semele:
6150	No, nor for Ceres, golden-tressed Queen,
6150	Nor for Latona bright, nor for thyself,
6150	"As now with fond desire for thee I burn."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Juno with deceitful speech:
6150	"""What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
6150	If here on Ida, in the face of day,
6150	We celebrate the mystic rites of love.
6150	How if some other of th' immortal Gods
6150	Should find us sleeping, and 'mid all the Gods
6150	Should spread the tale abroad? I could not then
6150	Straight to thy house, for very shame, return.
6150	But if indeed such passion fill thy soul,
6150	Thou hast thy secret chamber, built for thee
6150	By Vulcan, with close-fitting doors secur'd;
6150	"Thither, if such thy pleasure, go we now."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
6150	"""Juno, nor fear the eye of God or man;"
6150	For all around us I will throw such veil
6150	Of golden cloud, that not the sun himself
6150	"With sharpest beam of light may pierce it through."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, in his arms he clasp'd his wife;
6150	The teeming earth beneath them caus'd to spring
6150	The tender grass, and lotus dew-besprent,
6150	Crocus and hyacinth, a fragrant couch,
6150	Profuse and soft, upspringing from the earth.
6150	There lay they, all around them spread a veil
6150	Of golden cloud, whence heav'nly dews distill'd.
6150	There on the topmost height of Gargarus,
6150	By sleep and love subdued, th' immortal Sire,
6150	Clasp'd in his arms his wife, repos'd in peace.
6150	""
6150	Then Sleep arose, and to the Grecian ships
6150	In haste repairing, to th' Earth-shaking King
6150	His tidings bore; and standing at his side
6150	Thus to the God his winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Now, Neptune, to the Greeks thy ready aid"
6150	Afford, that short-liv'd triumph they may gain,
6150	While slumber holds the eyes of Jove; for I
6150	In sweet unconsciousness have drown'd his sense,
6150	"Beguil'd by Juno, in whose arms he lies."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and vanish'd 'mid the tribes of men:
6150	But fir'd with keener zeal to aid the Greeks,
6150	Neptune sprang forth in front, and call'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Again, ye Greeks, shall our remissness yield"
6150	The victory to Hector, Priam's son,
6150	To seize our ships, and endless glory gain?
6150	Such is his boast and menace, since in wrath
6150	Achilles still beside his ships remains.
6150	Yet him we scarce should miss, if we, the rest,
6150	But firmly stood for mutual defence.
6150	Hear then my counsel: let us all agree,
6150	Girt with our best and broadest shields, our heads
6150	With flashing helmets guarded, in our hands
6150	Grasping our longest spears, to dare the fight.
6150	Myself will lead you on; and Priam's son,
6150	Though bold he be, will fear with me to cope.
6150	And if, among our bravest, any bear
6150	Too small a buckler, with some meaner man
6150	"Let him exchange, and don the larger shield."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and they assenting heard his speech.
6150	The Kings themselves, Ulysses, Diomed,
6150	And mighty Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
6150	Though sorely wounded, yet the troops array'd;
6150	Thro'out the ranks they pass'd, and chang'd the arms;
6150	The bravest donn'd the best, the worse the worst.
6150	When with their dazzling armour all were girt,
6150	Forward they mov'd; th' Earth-shaker led them on:
6150	In his broad hand an awful sword he bore,
6150	Long-bladed, vivid as the lightning's flash:
6150	Yet in the deadly strife he might not join,
6150	But kindled terror in the minds of men.
6150	""
6150	Hector meantime the Trojan troops array'd.
6150	Then fiercer grew, and more intense the strain
6150	Of furious fight, when Ocean's dark-hair'd King
6150	And Priam's noble son were met in arms,
6150	And aided, this the Trojans, that the Greeks.
6150	High tow'rd the tents uprose the surging sea,
6150	As with loud clamour met th' opposing hosts.
6150	Less loud the roar of Ocean's wave, that driv'n
6150	By stormy Boreas, breaks upon the beach;
6150	Less loud the crackling of the flames that rage
6150	In the deep forest of some mountain glen;
6150	Less loud the wind, to wildest fury rous'd,
6150	Howls in the branches of the lofty oaks;
6150	Than rose the cry of Trojans and of Greeks,
6150	As each, with furious shout, encounter'd each.
6150	At Ajax first, who straight before him stood,
6150	Great Hector threw his spear, nor miss'd his aim,
6150	Where the two belts, the one which bore his shield,
6150	His silver-studded sword the other, met
6150	Across his breast; these two his life preserv'd.
6150	Hector was wroth, that from his stalwart hand
6150	The spear had flown in vain; and back he sprang
6150	For safety to his comrades' shelt'ring ranks:
6150	But mighty Ajax Telamon upheav'd
6150	A pond'rous stone, of many, all around
6150	That scatter'd lay beneath the warriors' feet,
6150	And serv'd to prop the ships; with one of these,
6150	As Hector backward stepp'd, above the shield
6150	He smote him on the breast, below the throat.
6150	With whirling motion, circling as it flew,
6150	The mass he hurl'd. As by the bolt of Heav'n
6150	Uprooted, prostrate lies some forest oak;
6150	The sulph'rous vapour taints the air; appall'd,
6150	Bereft of strength, the near beholder stands,
6150	And awestruck hears the thunder-peal of Jove;
6150	So in the dust the might of Hector lay:
6150	Dropp'd from his hand the spear; the shield and helm
6150	Fell with him; loud his polished armour rang.
6150	On rush'd, with joyous shout, the sons of Greece,
6150	In hope to seize the spoil; thick flew the spears:
6150	Yet none might reach or wound the fallen chief;
6150	For gather'd close around, the bravest all,
6150	Valiant AEneas, and Polydamas,
6150	Godlike Agenor, and the Lycian chief
6150	Sarpedon, and the noble Glaucus stood.
6150	Nor did the rest not aid; their shields' broad orbs
6150	Before him still they held, while in their arms
6150	His comrades bore him from the battle-field,
6150	To where, with charioteer and well-wrought car,
6150	Beyond the fight, his flying coursers stood,
6150	Which bore him, deeply groaning, tow'rd the town.
6150	But when the ford was reach'd of Xanthus' stream,
6150	Broad-flowing, eddying, by immortal Jove
6150	Begotten, on the ground they laid him down,
6150	And dash'd the cooling water on his brow:
6150	Reviv'd, he lifted up awhile his eyes;
6150	Then on his knees half rising, he disgorg'd
6150	The clotted blood; but backward to the earth,
6150	Still by the blow subdu'd, again he fell,
6150	And darkling shades of night his eyes o'erspread.
6150	""
6150	Onward, with zeal redoubled, press'd the Greeks,
6150	When Hector from the field they saw withdrawn.
6150	Foremost of all, Oileus' active son,
6150	With sudden spring assailing, Satnius slew:
6150	Him a fair Naiad nymph to OEnops bore,
6150	Who by the banks of Satnois kept his herds.
6150	Him then, approaching near, Oileus' son
6150	Thrust through the flank: he fell, and o'er his corpse
6150	Trojans and Greeks in stubborn fight engag'd.
6150	But Panthous' son a swift avenger came,
6150	Polydamas, with brandish'd spear, and struck
6150	Through the right shoulder Prothoenor, son
6150	Of Areilycus; right through was driv'n
6150	The sturdy spear; he, rolling in the dust,
6150	Clutch'd with his palms the ground; then, shouting loud,
6150	Thus with triumphant boast Polydamas:
6150	""
6150	"""From the strong hand of Panthous' noble son"
6150	Methinks that not in vain the spear has flown:
6150	A Greek now bears it off; and he, perchance,
6150	"May use it as a staff to Pluto's realm."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; the Greeks with pain his vaunting heard;
6150	But chief it rous'd the spirit within the breast
6150	Of Ajax Telamon, whom close beside
6150	The dead had fall'n; he at Polydamas,
6150	Retreating, hurl'd in haste his glitt'ring spear;
6150	He, springing sideways, 'scap'd the stroke of fate;
6150	But young Archilochus, Antenor's son,
6150	Receiv'd the spear, for Heav'n had will'd his death:
6150	The spine it struck, the topmost joint, where met
6150	The head and neck, and both the tendons broke;
6150	Forward he fell; and ere or knee or leg,
6150	His head, and mouth, and nostrils struck the ground.
6150	""
6150	Then Ajax, in his turn, exulting, thus:
6150	"""Say now, Polydamas, and tell me true,"
6150	May this be deem'd for Prothoenor's death
6150	A full equivalent? no common man
6150	He seems, and born of no ignoble race;
6150	Valiant Antenor's brother, or perchance
6150	"His son; the likeness speaks him near akin."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he, though well he knew; then bitter grief
6150	Possess'd the Trojans' souls; but Acamas,
6150	Guarding his brother's body, with his spear
6150	Slew the Boeotian Promachus, who fain
6150	Would by the feet have drawn away the dead:
6150	Then Acamas, exulting, cried aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Ye wretched Greeks, in boasting measureless!"
6150	Not ours alone the labour and the loss
6150	Of battle; ye too have your share of death.
6150	Behold where lies your Promachus, subdued
6150	Beneath my spear; not long unpaid the debt
6150	Due for my brother's blood! 'Tis well for him
6150	"Who leaves a brother to avenge his fate."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; the Greeks with pain his vaunting heard;
6150	But chief it rous'd the spirit within the breast
6150	Of Peneleus; on Acamas he sprang,
6150	Who waited not th' encounter; next he slew
6150	Ilioneus, the son of Phorbas, Lord
6150	Of num'rous flocks, of all the Trojans most
6150	Belov'd of Hermes, who his wealth increas'd.
6150	To him Ilioneus, an only son,
6150	His mother bore; who now, beneath the brow
6150	And through the socket of the eye was struck,
6150	Thrusting the eyeball out; for through the eye,
6150	And backward through the head, the spear was driv'n:
6150	With hands extended, down to earth he sank;
6150	But Peneleus his weighty sword let fall
6150	Full on his neck; the sever'd head and helm
6150	Together fell, remaining still infix'd
6150	The sturdy spear; then he, the gory head
6150	Uplifting, to the Trojans vaunting cried:
6150	""
6150	"""Go now, ye Trojans! bid that in the house"
6150	Of brave Ilioneus his parents raise
6150	The voice of wailing for their gallant son;
6150	As neither shall the wife of Promachus,
6150	The son of Alegenor, with glad smile
6150	Her husband's coming hail, when home from Troy
6150	"We sons of Greece, with vict'ry crown'd, return."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, pale fear possess'd them all,
6150	Each looking round to seek escape from death.
6150	""
6150	Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell,
6150	Who, when th' Earth-shaker turn'd the tide of war,
6150	First bore away his foeman's bloody spoils?

6150	Great Ajax Telamon first Hyrtius smote,
6150	The son of Gyrtius, who to battle led
6150	The warlike Mysians; next Antilochus

6150	Meriones Hippotion gave to death,
6150	And Morys; Teucer Periphetes slew,

6150	THE FIFTH BATTLE, AT THE SHIPS; AND THE ACTS OF AJAX.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector
6150	in a swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks; he is highly
6150	incensed at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions;
6150	she is then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing to the assembly of
6150	the gods, attempts with extraordinary address to incense them against
6150	Jupiter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he
6150	is ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo
6150	obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle,
6150	to which, after much reluctance and passion, he consents. Apollo
6150	reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him back to the battle, marches
6150	before him with his aegis, and turns the fortune of the fight. He
6150	breaks down the first part of the Grecian wall; the Trojans rush in,
6150	and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are yet repelled
6150	by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.

6150	""
6150	Now when the Trojans had recross'd the trench
6150	And palisades, and in their headlong flight
6150	Many had fall'n by Grecian swords, the rest,
6150	Routed, and pale with fear, made head awhile
6150	Beside their cars; then Jove on Ida's height
6150	At golden-throned Juno's side awoke;
6150	Rising, he saw the Trojans and the Greeks,
6150	Those in confusion, while behind them press'd
6150	The Greeks, triumphant, Neptune in their midst:
6150	He saw too Hector stretch'd upon the plain,
6150	His comrades standing round; senseless he lay,
6150	Drawing short breath, blood gushing from his mouth;
6150	For by no feeble hand the blow was dealt.
6150	""
6150	Pitying, the Sire of Gods and men beheld,
6150	And thus, with sternest glance, to Juno spoke:
6150	"""This, Juno, is thy work! thy wicked wiles"
6150	Have Hector quell'd, and Trojans driv'n to flight:
6150	Nor know I but thyself mayst reap the fruit,
6150	By shameful scourging, of thy vile deceit.
6150	Hast thou forgotten how in former times
6150	I hung thee from on high, and to thy feet
6150	Attach'd two pond'rous anvils, and thy hands
6150	With golden fetters bound, which none might break?
6150	There didst thou hang amid the clouds of Heav'n;
6150	Through all Olympus' breadth the Gods were wroth;
6150	Yet dar'd not one approach to set thee free.
6150	If any so had ventur'd, him had I
6150	Hurl'd from Heav'n's threshold till to earth he fell,
6150	With little left of life. Yet was not quench'd
6150	My wrath on godlike Hercules' account,
6150	Whom thou, with Boreas, o'er the wat'ry waste
6150	With fell intent didst send; and tempest-toss'd,
6150	Cast him ashore on Coos' fruitful isle.
6150	I rescued him from thence, and brought him back,
6150	After long toil, to Argos' grassy plains.
6150	This to thy mind I bring, that thou mayst learn
6150	To cease thy treach'rous wiles, nor hope to gain
6150	By all thy lavish'd blandishments of love,
6150	"Wherewith thou hast deceived me, and betray'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and terror seiz'd the stag-ey'd Queen;
6150	Who thus with winged words address'd her Lord:
6150	""
6150	"""By Earth I swear, and yon broad Heav'n above,"
6150	And Stygian stream beneath, the weightiest oath
6150	Of solemn pow'r to bind the blessed Gods;
6150	By thine own sacred head, our nuptial bed,
6150	Whose holy tie I never could forswear;
6150	That not by my suggestion and advice
6150	Earth-shaking Neptune on the Trojan host,
6150	And Hector, pours his wrath, and aids the Greeks;
6150	In this he but obeys his own desire,
6150	Who looks with pity on the Grecian host
6150	Beside their ships o'erborne; and could my words
6150	Prevail, my counsel were to shape his course,
6150	"O cloud-girt King, obedient to thy will."""
6150	""
6150	She said; the Sire of Gods and men, well pleas'd,
6150	Her answer heard, and thus with gracious smile:
6150	""
6150	"""If, stag-ey'd Queen, in synod of the Gods"
6150	Thy counsels shall indeed with mine agree,
6150	Neptune, how strong soe'er his wish, must change
6150	His course, obedient to thy will and mine;
6150	And if in all sincerity thou speak,
6150	Go to th' assembled Gods, and hither send
6150	Iris, and Phoebus of the silver bow;
6150	That she may to the Grecian camp repair,
6150	And bid that Neptune from the battle-field
6150	Withdraw, and to his own domain retire;
6150	While Phoebus Hector to the fight restores,
6150	Inspiring new-born vigour, and allaying
6150	The mortal pains which bow his spirit down:
6150	Then, heartless fear infusing in the Greeks,
6150	Put them to flight, that flying they may fall
6150	Beside Achilles' ships; his comrade then,
6150	Patroclus, he shall send to battle forth
6150	To be by Hector slain, in front of Troy;
6150	Yet not to fall till many valiant youths
6150	Have felt his prowess; and, amid the rest,
6150	My son, Sarpedon; by his comrade's death
6150	Enrag'd, Achilles Hector shall subdue;
6150	Thenceforth my counsel is, that from the ships
6150	The Trojan force shall still be backward driv'n,
6150	Until at length, by Pallas' deep designs,
6150	The Greeks possess the lofty walls of Troy.
6150	Yet will not I my anger intermit,
6150	Nor suffer other of th' immortal Gods
6150	To aid the Greeks, till Peleus' son behold
6150	His wish accomplish'd, and the boon obtain'd
6150	I promis'd once, and with a nod confirm'd,
6150	That day when sea-born Thetis clasp'd my knees,
6150	"And pray'd me to avenge her warrior son."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; the white-arm'd Queen of Heav'n submiss
6150	His mandate heard; and from th' Idaean mount
6150	With rapid flight to high Olympus sped.
6150	Swift as the mind of man, who many a land
6150	Hath travell'd o'er, and with reflective thought
6150	"Recalls, ""here was I such a day, or here,"""
6150	And in a moment many a scene surveys;
6150	So Juno sped o'er intervening space;
6150	Olympus' heights she reach'd, and in the house
6150	Of Jove appear'd amid th' assembled Gods.
6150	They at her coming rose, with golden cups
6150	Greeting their Queen's approach; the rest she pass'd,
6150	And from the hand of fair-fac'd Themis took
6150	The proffer'd cup, who first had run to meet,
6150	And thus with winged words address'd the Queen:
6150	"""Juno, why com'st thou hither? and with looks"
6150	Of one distraught with, fear? hath Saturn's son,
6150	"Thy mighty Lord, thus sore affrighted thee?"""
6150	To whom the white-arm'd Goddess, Juno, thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Forbear thy questions, Themis; well thou know'st"
6150	How haughty and imperious is his mind;
6150	Thou for the Gods in haste prepare the feast;
6150	Then shalt thou learn, amid th' Immortals all,
6150	What evil he designs; nor all, I ween,
6150	His counsels will approve, or men, or Gods,
6150	"Though now in blissful ignorance they feast."""
6150	""
6150	She said, and sat; the Gods, oppress'd with care,
6150	Her farther speech awaited; on her lips
6150	There dwelt indeed a smile, but not a ray
6150	Pass'd o'er her dark'ning brow, as thus her wrath
6150	Amid th' assembled Gods found vent in words:
6150	""
6150	"""Fools are we all, who madly strive with Jove,"
6150	Or hope, by access to his throne, to sway,
6150	By word or deed, his course; from all apart,
6150	He all our counsels heeds not, but derides;
6150	And boasts o'er all th' immortal Gods to reign
6150	In unapproach'd pre-eminence of pow'r.
6150	Prepare then each his sev'ral woe to bear;
6150	On Mars e'en now, methinks, the blow hath fall'n;
6150	Since in the fight, the man he loves the best,
6150	"And boasts his son, Ascalaphus, is slain."""
6150	She said; and Mars, enrag'd, his brawny thigh
6150	Smote with his hands, and thus, lamenting, spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Blame not, ye Gods, who on Olympus dwell,"
6150	That to the Grecian ships I haste, to avenge
6150	My slaughter'd son, though blasted by Heav'n's fire
6150	"'Twere mine 'mid corpses, blood, and dust to lie."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and gave command to Fear and Flight
6150	To yoke his ear; and donn'd his glitt'ring arms.
6150	Then from the throne of Jove had heavier wrath
6150	And deeper vengeance on th' Immortals fall'n,
6150	But Pallas, in alarm for all the Gods,
6150	Quitting in haste the throne whereon she sat,
6150	Sprang past the vestibule, and from his head
6150	The helmet lifted, from his arm the shield;
6150	Took from his sturdy hand, and rear'd upright,
6150	The brazen spear; then with reproachful words
6150	She thus assail'd th' impetuous God of War;
6150	""
6150	"""Frantic, and passion-maddened, thou art lost!"
6150	Hast thou no ears to hear! or are thy mind
6150	And sense of rev'rence utterly destroyed?
6150	Or heard'st thou not what white-arm'd Juno spoke,
6150	Fresh from the presence of Olympian Jove?
6150	Wouldst thou, thine evil destiny fulfill'd,
6150	By hard constraint, despite thy grief, be driv'n
6150	Back to Olympus; and to all the rest
6150	Confusion and disaster with thee bring?
6150	At once from valiant Trojans and from Greeks
6150	His thoughts would be diverted, and his wrath
6150	Embroil Olympus, and on all alike,
6150	Guilty or not, his anger would be pour'd.
6150	Waive then thy vengeance for thy gallant son;
6150	Others as brave of heart, as strong of arm,
6150	Have fall'n, and yet must fall; and vain th' attempt
6150	"To watch at once o'er all the race of men."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, to his seat again she forc'd
6150	Th' impetuous Mars: meanwhile, without the house,
6150	Juno, by Jove's command, Apollo call'd,
6150	And Iris, messenger from God to God;
6150	And thus to both her winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Jove bids you with all speed to Ida haste;"
6150	And when, arriv'd, before his face ye stand,
6150	"Whate'er he orders, that observe and do."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Juno spoke, and to her throne return'd;
6150	While they to spring-abounding Ida's heights,
6150	Wild nurse of forest beasts, pursued their way;
6150	Th' all-seeing son of Saturn there they found
6150	Upon the topmost crag of Gargarus,
6150	An incense-breathing cloud around him spread.
6150	Before the face of cloud-compelling Jove
6150	They stood; well-pleas'd he witness'd their approach
6150	In swift obedience to his consort's words,
6150	And thus to Iris first his speech address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Haste thee, swift Iris, and to Ocean's King"
6150	My message bear, nor misreporting aught,
6150	Nor aught omitting; from the battle-field
6150	Bid him retire, and join th' assembled Gods,
6150	Or to his own domain of sea withdraw.
6150	If my commands he heed not, nor obey,
6150	Let him consider in his inmost soul
6150	If, mighty though he be, he dare await
6150	My hostile coming; mightier far than him,
6150	His elder born; nor may his spirit aspire
6150	"To rival me, whom all regard with awe."""
6150	""
6150	He said; swift-footed Iris, at the word,
6150	From Ida's heights to sacred Ilium sped.
6150	Swift as the snow-flakes from the clouds descend,
6150	Or wintry hail before the driving blast
6150	Of Boreas, ether-born; so swift to Earth
6150	Descended Iris; by his side she stood,
6150	And with these words th' Earth-shaking God address'd:
6150	"""A message, dark-hair'd Circler of the Earth,"
6150	To thee I bring from AEgis-bearing Jove.
6150	He bids thee straightway from the battle-field
6150	Retire, and either join th' assembled Gods,
6150	Or to thine own domain of sea withdraw.
6150	If his commands thou heed not, nor obey,
6150	Hither he menaces himself to come,
6150	And fight against thee; but he warns thee first,
6150	Beware his arm, as mightier far than thee,
6150	Thine elder born; nor may thy spirit aspire
6150	"To rival him, whom all regard with awe."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in tow'ring wrath th' Earth-shaking God:
6150	"""By Heav'n, though great he be, he yet presumes"
6150	Somewhat too far, if me, his equal born,
6150	He seeks by force to baffle of my will.
6150	We were three brethren, all of Rhaea born
6150	To Saturn; Jove and I, and Pluto third,
6150	Who o'er the nether regions holds his sway.
6150	Threefold was our partition; each obtain'd
6150	His meed of honour due; the hoary Sea
6150	By lot my habitation was assign'd;
6150	The realms of Darkness fell to Pluto's share;
6150	Broad Heav'n, amid the sky and clouds, to Jove;
6150	But Earth, and high Olympus, are to all
6150	A common heritage; nor will I walk
6150	To please the will of Jove; though great he be,
6150	With his own third contented let him rest:
6150	Nor let him think that I, as wholly vile,
6150	Shall quail before his arm; his lofty words
6150	Were better to his daughters and his sons
6150	Address'd, his own begotten; who perforce
6150	"Must listen to his mandates, and obey."""
6150	""
6150	To whom swift-footed Iris thus replied:
6150	"""Is this, then, dark-hair'd Circler of the Earth,"
6150	The message, stern and haughty, which to Jove
6150	Thou bidd'st me bear? perchance thine angry mood
6150	May bend to better counsels; noblest minds
6150	Are easiest bent; and o'er superior age
6150	"Thou know'st th' avenging Furies ever watch."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Earth-shaking Neptune thus replied:
6150	"""Immortal Iris, weighty are thy words,"
6150	And in good season spoken; and 'tis well
6150	When envoys are by sound discretion led.
6150	Yet are my heart and mind with grief oppress'd,
6150	When me, his equal both by birth and fate,
6150	He seeks with haughty words to overbear.
6150	I yield, but with indignant sense of wrong.
6150	This too I say, nor shall my threat be vain:
6150	Let him remember, if in my despite,
6150	'Gainst Pallas', Juno's, Hermes', Vulcan's will,
6150	He spare to overthrow proud Ilium's tow'rs,
6150	And crown with victory the Grecian arms,
6150	"The feud between us never can be heal'd."""
6150	""
6150	Th' Earth-shaker said, and from the field withdrew
6150	Beneath the ocean wave, the warrior Greeks
6150	His loss deploring; to Apollo then
6150	The Cloud-compeller thus his speech address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Go straight to Hector of the brazen helm,"

6150	My high displeasure; had he dar'd resist,
6150	The tumult of our strife had reach'd the Gods
6150	Who in the nether realms with Saturn dwell.
6150	Yet thus 'tis better, both for me and him,
6150	That, though indignant, to my will he yields;
6150	For to compel him were no easy task.
6150	Take thou, and wave on high thy tassell'd shield,
6150	The Grecian warriors daunting: thou thyself,
6150	Far-darting King, thy special care bestow
6150	On noble Hector; so restore his strength
6150	And vigour, that in panic to their ships,
6150	And the broad Hellespont, the Greeks be driv'n.
6150	Then will I so by word and deed contrive
6150	"That they may gain fresh respite from their toil."""

6150	Dash'd to the earth, and all my vigour quell'd?

6150	To bathe his sides; then tossing high his head,
6150	While o'er his shoulders streams his ample mane,
6150	Light-borne on active limbs, in conscious pride,
6150	To the wide pastures of the mares he flies;
6150	So vig'rous, Hector plied his active limbs,

6150	And Meges, bold as Mars, with all their best,
6150	Their stedfast battle rang'd, to wait th' assault
6150	Of Hector and his Trojans; while behind,
6150	Th' unwarlike many to the ships retir'd.
6150	The Trojan mass came on, by Hector led
6150	With haughty stride; before him Phoebus went,
6150	His shoulders veil'd in cloud; his arm sustain'd
6150	The awful AEgis, dread to look on, hung
6150	With shaggy tassels round and dazzling bright;
6150	Which Vulcan, skilful workman, gave to Jove,
6150	To scatter terror 'mid the souls of men.
6150	This on his arm, the Trojan troops he led.
6150	Firm stood the mass of Greeks; from either side
6150	Shrill clamours rose; and fast from many a string
6150	The arrows flew, and many a jav'lin, hurl'd
6150	By vig'rous arms; some buried in the flesh
6150	Of stalwart youths, and many, ere they reach'd
6150	Their living mark, fell midway on the plain,
6150	Fix'd in the ground, in vain athirst for blood.
6150	While Phoebus motionless his AEgis held,
6150	Thick flew the shafts, and fast the people fell
6150	On either side; but when he turn'd its flash
6150	Full in the faces of the astonish'd Greeks,
6150	And shouted loud, their spirits within them quail'd,
6150	Their fiery courage borne in mind no more.
6150	As when two beasts of prey, at dead of night.
6150	With sudden onset scatter wide a herd
6150	Of oxen, or a num'rous flock of sheep,
6150	Their keepers absent; so unnerv'd by fear
6150	The Greeks dispers'd; such panic 'mid their ranks,
6150	That vict'ry so might crown the Trojan arms,
6150	Apollo sent; and as the masses broke,
6150	Each Trojan slew his man; by Hector's hand
6150	Fell Stichius and Arcesilas; the one,
6150	The leader of Boeotia's brass-clad host,
6150	The other, brave Menestheus' trusted friend.
6150	AEneas Medon slew, and Iasus;
6150	Medon, the great Oileus' bastard son,
6150	Brother of Ajax; he in Phylace,
6150	Far from his native home, was driv'n to dwell;
6150	Since one to Eriopis near akin,
6150	His sire Oileus' wife, his hand had slain:
6150	And Iasus, th' Athenian chief, was deem'd
6150	The son of Sphelus, son of Bucolus.
6150	Polydamas amid the foremost ranks
6150	Mecistes slew, Polites Echius,
6150	Agenor Olonius; while from Paris' hand
6150	An arrow, 'mid the crowd of fugitives
6150	Shot from behind, beneath the shoulder struck
6150	Deiocus, and through his chest was driv'n:
6150	These while the Trojans of their arms despoil'd,
6150	Through ditch and palisades promiscuous dash'd
6150	The flying Greeks, and gain'd, hard-press'd, the wall;
6150	While loudly Hector to the Trojans call'd
6150	To assail the ships, and leave the bloody spoils:
6150	"""Whom I elsewhere, and from the ships aloof"
6150	Shall find, my hand shall doom him on the spot;
6150	For him no fun'ral pyre his kin shall light,
6150	Or male or female; but before the wall
6150	"Our city's dogs his mangled flesh shall tear."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and on his horses' shoulder point
6150	Let fall the lash, and loudly through the ranks
6150	Call'd on the Trojans; they, with answ'ring shout
6150	And noise unspeakable, urg'd on with him
6150	Their harness'd steeds; Apollo, in the van,
6150	Trod down with ease th' embankment of the ditch,
6150	And fill'd it in; and o'er it bridg'd a way
6150	Level and wide, far as a jav'lin's flight
6150	Hurl'd by an arm that proves its utmost strength.
6150	O'er this their columns pass'd; Apollo bore
6150	His AEgis o'er them, and cast down the wall;
6150	Easy, as when a child upon the beach,
6150	In wanton play, with hands and feet o'erthrows
6150	The mound of sand, which late in play he rais'd;
6150	So, Phoebus, thou, the Grecian toil and pains
6150	Confounding, sentest panic through their souls.
6150	Thus hemm'd beside the ships they made their stand,
6150	While each exhorted each, and all, with hands
6150	Outstretch'd, to ev'ry God address'd their pray'r:
6150	And chief, Gerenian Nestor, prop of Greece,
6150	With hands uplifted tow'rd the starry Heav'n:
6150	""
6150	"""O Father Jove! if any e'er to Thee"
6150	On corn-clad plains of Argos burnt the fat
6150	Of bulls and sheep, and offer'd up his pray'r
6150	For safe return; and thine assenting nod
6150	Confirm'd thy promise; O remember now
6150	His pray'r; stave off the pitiless day of doom,
6150	"Nor let the Greeks to Trojan arms succumb."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Nestor pray'd; loud thunder'd from on high
6150	The Lord of counsel, as he heard the pray'r
6150	Of Neleus' aged son; with double zeal,
6150	The Trojans, as the mind of Jove they knew,
6150	Press'd on the Greeks, with warlike ardour fir'd.
6150	As o'er the bulwarks of a ship pour down
6150	The mighty billows of the wide-path'd sea,
6150	Driv'n by the blast, that tosses high the waves,
6150	So down the wall, with shouts, the Trojans pour'd;
6150	The cars admitted, by the ships they fought
6150	With double-pointed spears, and hand to hand;
6150	These on their chariots, on the lofty decks
6150	Of their dark vessels those, with pond'rous spars
6150	Which on the ships were stor'd for naval war,
6150	Compact and strong, their heads encas'd in brass.
6150	""
6150	While yet beyond the ships, about the wall
6150	The Greeks and Trojans fought, Patroclus still
6150	Within the tent of brave Eurypylus
6150	Remaining, with his converse sooth'd the chief,
6150	And healing unguents to his wound applied,
6150	Of pow'r to charm away the bitter pains;
6150	But when the Trojans pouring o'er the wall,
6150	And routed Greeks in panic flight he saw,
6150	Deeply he groan'd, and smiting on his thigh
6150	With either palm, in anguish thus he spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Eurypylus, how great soe'er thy need,"
6150	I can no longer stay; so fierce the storm
6150	Of battle rages; but th' attendants' care
6150	Will all thy wants supply; while I in haste
6150	Achilles seek, and urge him to the war;
6150	Who knows but Heav'n may grant me to succeed?
6150	"For great is oft a friend's persuasive pow'r."""
6150	He said, and quickly on his errand sped.
6150	""
6150	Meanwhile the Greeks, in firm array, endur'd
6150	The onset of the Trojans; nor could these
6150	The assailants, though in numbers less, repel;
6150	Nor those again the Grecian masses break,
6150	And force their passage through the ships and tents,
6150	As by a rule, in cunning workman's hand,
6150	Who all his art by Pallas' aid has learnt,
6150	A vessel's plank is smooth and even laid,
6150	So level lay the balance of the fight.
6150	Others round other ships maintain'd the war,
6150	But Hector that of Ajax sought alone.
6150	For that one ship they two unwearied toil'd;
6150	Nor Hector Ajax from his post could move,
6150	And burn the ship with fire; nor he repel
6150	The foe who came protected by a God.
6150	Then noble Ajax with his jav'lin smote
6150	Caletor, son of Clytius, through the breast,
6150	As tow'rd the ship a blazing torch he bore;
6150	Thund'ring he fell, and dropp'd his hand the torch.
6150	But Hector, when his eyes his kinsman saw
6150	By the dark vessel, prostrate in the dust,
6150	On Trojans and on Lycians call'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Trojans and Lycians, and ye Dardans, fam'd"
6150	In close encounter, in this press of war
6150	Slack not your efforts; haste to save the son
6150	Of Clytius, nor let Greeks his arms possess,
6150	"Who 'mid their throng of ships has nobly fall'n."""
6150	At Ajax, as he spoke, his gleaming spear
6150	He threw, but miss'd his aim; yet Lycophron,
6150	His comrade, of Cythera, Mastor's son
6150	(Who flying from Cythera's lovely isle
6150	With guilt of bloodshed, near to Ajax dwelt),
6150	Standing beside the chief, above the ear
6150	He struck, and pierc'd the brain: from the tall prow
6150	Backwards he fell, his limbs relax'd in death.
6150	Then Ajax, shudd'ring, on his brother call'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Good Teucer, we have lost a faithful friend,"
6150	The son of Mastor, our Cytheran guest,
6150	Whom as a father all rever'd; who now
6150	Lies slain by noble Hector. Where are then
6150	Thine arrows, swift-wing'd messengers of fate,
6150	"And where thy trusty bow, Apollo's gift?"""
6150	""
6150	Thus Ajax; Teucer heard, and ran in haste,
6150	And stood beside him, with his bended bow,
6150	And well-stor'd quiver: on the Trojans fast
6150	He pour'd his shafts; and struck Pisenor's son,
6150	Clitus, the comrade of Polydamas,
6150	The noble son of Panthous; he the reins
6150	Held in his hand, and all his care bestow'd
6150	To guide his horses; for, where'er the throng
6150	Was thickest, there in Hector's cause, and Troy's,
6150	He still was found; but o'er him hung the doom
6150	Which none might turn aside; for from behind
6150	The fateful arrow struck him through the neck;
6150	Down from the car he fell; swerving aside,
6150	The startled horses whirl'd the empty car.
6150	Them first the King Polydamas beheld,
6150	And stay'd their course; to Protiaon's son,
6150	Astynous, then he gave them, with command
6150	To keep good watch, and still be near at hand;
6150	Then 'mid the foremost join'd again the fray.
6150	Again at Hector of the brazen helm
6150	An arrow Teucer aim'd; and had the shaft
6150	The life of Hector quench'd in mid career,
6150	Not long the fight had rag'd around the ships:
6150	But Jove's all-seeing eye beheld, who watch'd
6150	O'er Hector's life, and Teucer's hopes deceiv'd.
6150	The bow's well-twisted string he snapp'd in twain,
6150	As Teucer drew; the brass-tipp'd arrow flew
6150	Wide of the mark, and dropp'd his hand the bow.
6150	Then to his brother, all aghast, he cried:
6150	"""O Heav'n, some God our best-laid schemes of war"
6150	Confounds, who from my hand hath, wrench'd the bow,
6150	And snapp'd the newly-twisted string, which I
6150	"But late attach'd, my swift-wing'd shafts to bear."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus great Ajax Telamon:
6150	"""O friend, leave there thine arrows and thy bow,"
6150	Marr'd by some God who grudges our renown;
6150	But take in hand thy pond'rous spear, and cast
6150	Thy shield about thy shoulders, and thyself
6150	Stand forth, and urge the rest, to face the foe.
6150	Let us not tamely yield, if yield we must,
6150	"Our well-built ships, but nobly dare the fight."""
6150	""
6150	"""Thus Ajax spoke; and Teucer in the tent"
6150	Bestowed his bow, and o'er his shoulders threw
6150	His fourfold shield; and on his firm-set head
6150	A helm he plac'd, well-wrought, with horsehair plume,
6150	That nodded, fearful, o'er his brow; his hand
6150	Grasp'd the firm spear, with sharpen'd point of brass:
6150	Then ran, and swiftly stood by Ajax' side.
6150	Hector meanwhile, who saw the weapon marr'd,
6150	To Trojans and to Lycians call'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Trojans and Lycians, and ye Dardans fam'd"
6150	In close encounter, quit ye now like men;
6150	Against the ships your wonted valour show.
6150	E'en now, before our eyes, hath Jove destroy'd
6150	A chieftain's weapon. Easy 'tis to trace
6150	O'er human wars th' o'erruling hand of Jove,
6150	To whom he gives the prize of victory,
6150	And whom, withholding aid, he minishes,
6150	As now the Greeks, while we his favour gain.
6150	Pour then your force united on the ships;
6150	And if there be among you, who this day
6150	Shall meet his doom, by sword or arrow slain,
6150	E'en let him die! a glorious death is his
6150	Who for his country falls; and dying, leaves
6150	Preserv'd from danger, children, wife, and home,
6150	His heritage uninjur'd, when the Greeks
6150	"Embarking hence shall take their homeward way."""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh courage rous'd in ev'ry breast.
6150	Ajax, on th' other side, address'd the Greeks:
6150	""
6150	"""Shame on ye, Greeks! this very hour decides"
6150	If we must perish, or be sav'd, and ward
6150	Destruction from our ships; and can ye hope
6150	That each, if Hector of the glancing helm
6150	Shall burn our ships, on foot can reach his home?
6150	Or hear ye not, how, burning to destroy
6150	Our vessels, Hector cheers his forces on?
6150	Not to the dance, but to the fight he calls;
6150	Nor better counsel can for us be found,
6150	Than in close fight with heart and hand to join.
6150	'Twere better far at once to die, than live
6150	Hemm'd in and straiten'd thus, in dire distress,
6150	"Close to our ships, by meaner men beset."""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh courage rous'd in ev'ry breast.
6150	Then Hector Schedius, Perimedes' son,
6150	The Thracian leader, slew; on th' other side
6150	Ajax the captain of the foot o'ercame,
6150	Laodamas, Antenor's noble son;
6150	While of his arms Polydamas despoil'd
6150	Cyllenian Otus, friend of Phyleus' son,
6150	The proud Epeians' leader; Meges saw,
6150	And rush'd upon him; but Polydamas,
6150	Stooping, the blow evaded; him he miss'd;
6150	For Phoebus will'd not Panthous' son should fall
6150	In the front rank contending; but the spear
6150	Smote Croesmus through the breast; thund'ring he fell,
6150	And from his corpse the victor stripp'd his arms.
6150	Him Dolops, son of Lampus, spearman skill'd,
6150	Well train'd in ev'ry point of war, assail'd
6150	(The son of Lampus he, the prince of men,
6150	Son of Laomedon); from close at hand
6150	Forward he sprang, and thrust at Meges' shield;
6150	But him the solid corslet which he wore,
6150	With breast and back-piece fitted, sav'd from harm:*
6150	The corslet Phyleus brought from Ephyra,
6150	By Selles' stream; Euphetes, King of men,
6150	Bestow'd it as a friendly gift, to wear
6150	In battle for a guard from hostile spears;
6150	Which from destruction now preserv'd his son.
6150	Next Meges struck, with keen-edg'd spear, the crown
6150	Of Dolops' brass-bound, horsehair-crested helm,
6150	Sev'ring the horsehair plume, which, brilliant late
6150	With crimson dye, now lay defil'd in dust.
6150	Yet fought he on, and still for vict'ry hop'd;
6150	But warlike Menelaus to the aid
6150	Of Meges came; of Dolops unobserv'd
6150	He stood, and from behind his shoulder pierc'd;
6150	The point, its course pursuing, through his breast
6150	Was driv'n, and headlong on his face he fell.
6150	Forthwith, advanc'd the two to seize the spoils;
6150	But loudly Hector on his kinsmen call'd;
6150	On all, but chief on Icetaon's son,
6150	The valiant Melanippus; he erewhile,
6150	In far Percote, ere the foes appear'd,
6150	Pastur'd his herds; but when the ships of Greece
6150	Approach'd the shore, to Ilium back he came;
6150	There, 'mid the Trojans eminent, he dwelt
6150	In Priam's house, belov'd as Priam's son.
6150	Him Hector call'd by name, and thus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Why, Melanippus, stand we idly thus?"
6150	Doth not thy slaughter'd kinsmen touch thy heart?
6150	See how they rush on Dolops' arms to seize;
6150	Then on! no distant war must now be wag'd,
6150	But hand to hand, till or the Greeks be slain,
6150	"Or lofty Troy, with all her children, fall."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and led the way; him follow'd straight
6150	The godlike chief; great Ajax Telamon
6150	Meanwhile the Greeks encourag'd to the fight,
6150	"And cried, ""Brave comrades, quit ye now like men;"
6150	Bear a stout heart; and in the stubborn fight
6150	Let each to other mutual succour give;
6150	By mutual succour more are sav'd than fall;
6150	"In timid flight nor fame nor safety lies."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and pond'ring well his words, they stood,
6150	Firm in defence; as with a wall of brass
6150	The ships they guarded; though against them Jove
6150	Led on the Trojans; Menelaus then
6150	With stirring words Antilochus address'd:
6150	"""Antilochus, than thou, of all the Greeks"
6150	Is none more active, or more light of foot;
6150	None stronger hurls the spear; then from the crowd
6150	"Spring forth, and aim to reach some Trojan's life."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, he withdrew; fir'd by his words,
6150	Forth sprang the youth, and pois'd his glitt'ring spear,
6150	Glancing around him; back the Trojans drew
6150	Before his aim; nor flew the spear in vain;
6150	But through the breast it pierc'd, as on he came,
6150	Brave Melanippus, Icetaon's son.
6150	Thund'ring he fell, and loud his armour rang.
6150	Forth sprang Antilochus, as springs a hound
6150	Upon a fawn, which from its lair disturb'd
6150	A hunter's shaft has struck, and quell'd its pow'rs;
6150	So, Melanippus, sprang to seize thy spoils
6150	The stout Antilochus; but not unmark'd
6150	Of Hector's eye, who, hast'ning through the press,
6150	Advanc'd to meet him; waited not th' attack,
6150	Bold warrior as he was, Antilochus,
6150	But trembling fled: as when a beast of prey,
6150	Conscious of evil deed, amid the herd
6150	The guardian dog or herdsman's self has slain,
6150	And flies, ere yet th' avenging crowd collect;
6150	So fled the son of Nestor; onward press'd,
6150	By Hector led, the Trojans; loud their shouts,
6150	As on the Greeks their murd'rous shafts they pour'd:
6150	Yet turn'd he, when his comrades' ranks he reach'd.
6150	Then on the ships, as rav'ning lions, fell
6150	The Trojans: they but work'd the will of Jove,
6150	Who still their courage rais'd, and quell'd the Greeks;
6150	Of vict'ry these debarr'd, and those inspir'd;
6150	For so he will'd, that Hector, Priam's son,
6150	Should wrap in fire the beaked ships of Greece,
6150	And Thetis to the uttermost obtain
6150	Her over-bold petition; yet did Jove,
6150	The Lord of counsel, wait but to behold
6150	The flames ascending from the blazing ships:
6150	For from that hour the Trojans, backward driv'n,
6150	Should to the Greeks the final triumph leave.
6150	With such design, to seize the ships, he fir'd
6150	Th' already burning zeal of Priam's son;
6150	Fiercely he rag'd, as terrible as Mars
6150	With brandish'd spear; or as a raging fire
6150	'Mid the dense thickets on the mountain side.
6150	The foam was on his lips; bright flash'd his eyes
6150	Beneath his awful brows, and terribly
6150	Above his temples wav'd amid the fray
6150	The helm of Hector; Jove himself from Heav'n.
6150	His guardian hand extending, him alone
6150	With glory crowning 'mid the host of men;
6150	But short his term of glory: for the day
6150	Was fast approaching, when, with Pallas' aid,
6150	The might of Peleus' son should work his doom.
6150	Oft he essay'd to break the ranks, where'er
6150	The densest and throng noblest arms he saw;
6150	But strenuous though his efforts, all were vain:
6150	They, mass'd in close array, his charge withstood;
6150	Firm as a craggy rock, upstanding high,
6150	Close by the hoary sea, which meets unmov'd
6150	The boist'rous currents of the whistling winds,
6150	And the big waves that bellow round its base;
6150	So stood unmov'd the Greeks, and undismay'd.
6150	At length, all blazing in his arms, he sprang
6150	Upon the mass; so plunging down, as when
6150	On some tall vessel, from beneath the clouds
6150	A giant billow, tempest-nurs'd, descends;
6150	The deck is drench'd in foam; the stormy wind
6150	Howls in the shrouds; th' affrighted seamen quail
6150	In fear, but little way from death remov'd;
6150	So quail'd the spirit in ev'ry Grecian breast.
6150	""
6150	As when a rav'ning lion on a herd
6150	Of heifers falls, which on some marshy mead
6150	Feed numberless, beneath the care of one,
6150	Unskill'd from beasts of prey to guard his charge;
6150	And while beside the front or rear he walks,
6150	The lion on th' unguarded centre springs,
6150	Seizes on one, and scatters all the rest;
6150	So Hector, led by Jove, in wild alarm
6150	Scatter'd the Grecians all; but one alone,
6150	Brave Periphetes, of Mycenae, slew;
6150	The son of Copreus, whom Eurystheus sent
6150	His envoy to the might of Hercules;
6150	Far nobler than the father was the son;
6150	In speed of foot, in warlike might, in mind,
6150	In all, among Mycenians foremost he;
6150	Who now on Hector fresh renown conferr'd;
6150	For, backward as he stepp'd, against the rim
6150	Of the broad shield which for defence he bore,
6150	Down reaching to his feet, he tripp'd, and thus
6150	Entangled, backward fell; and as he fell,
6150	Around his temples clatter'd loud his helm.
6150	Hector beheld, and o'er him stood in haste,
6150	And with his spear transfix'd his breast, and slew
6150	Before his comrades' eyes; yet dar'd not one,
6150	Though grieving for their comrade's loss, advance
6150	To rescue; such of Hector was their awe.
6150	They fronted now the ships; the leading prows
6150	Which first were drawn on shore, still barr'd their way;
6150	Yet on they stream'd; and from the foremost ships,
6150	Now hardly press'd, the Greeks perforce retir'd;
6150	But closely mass'd before the tents they stood,
6150	Not scatter'd o'er the camp; by shame restrain'd,
6150	And fear; and loudly each exhorted each.
6150	Gerenian Nestor chief, the prop of Greece,
6150	Thus by their fathers singly each adjur'd:
6150	"""Quit ye like men, dear friends; and think it shame"
6150	To forfeit now the praise of other men;
6150	Let each man now his children and his wife,
6150	His fortunes and his parents, bear in mind;
6150	And not the living only, but the dead;
6150	For them, the absent, I, your suppliant, pray,
6150	"That firm ye stand, and scorn disgraceful flight."""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh courage rous'd in ev'ry breast;
6150	And from their eyeballs Pallas purg'd away
6150	The film of darkness; and on ev'ry side,
6150	Both tow'rd the ships and tow'rd the level fight,
6150	Clear light diffus'd; there Hector they discern'd,
6150	And all his comrades, those who stood aloof,
6150	And those who near the ships maintain'd the war.
6150	Then was not Ajax' mighty soul content
6150	To stand where stood the other sons of Greece;
6150	Along the vessels' lofty decks he mov'd
6150	With haughty stride; a pond'rous boarding-pike,
6150	Well polish'd, and with rivets well secur'd,
6150	Of two and twenty cubits' length, he bore,
6150	As one well-skill'd in feats of horsemanship,
6150	Who from a troop of horses on the plain
6150	Has parted four, and down the crowded road,
6150	While men and women all in wonder gaze,
6150	Drives tow'rd the city; and with force untir'd
6150	From one to other springs, as on they fly;
6150	O'er many a vessel's deck so Ajax pass'd
6150	With lofty stride, and voice that reach'd to Heav'n,
6150	As loudly shouting on the Greeks he call'd
6150	To save their ships and tents: nor Hector stay'd
6150	Amid the closely buckler'd Trojan ranks;
6150	But, as upon a flock of birds, that feed
6150	Beside a river's bank, or geese, or cranes,
6150	Or long-neck'd swans, a fiery eagle swoops;
6150	So on the dark-prow'd ship with furious rush
6150	Swept Hector down; him Jove with mighty hand
6150	Sustain'd, and with him forward urg'd the crowd.
6150	Fierce round the ships again the battle rag'd;
6150	Well might ye deem no previous toil had worn
6150	Their strength, who in that dread encounter met;
6150	With edge so keen, and stubborn will they fought.
6150	But varying far their hopes and fears: the Greeks
6150	Of safety and escape from death despair'd;
6150	While high the hopes in ev'ry Trojan's breast,
6150	To burn the ships, and slay the warlike Greeks;
6150	So minded each, oppos'd in arms they stood.
6150	""
6150	On a swift-sailing vessel's stern, that bore
6150	Protesilaus to the coast of Troy,
6150	But to his native country bore not thence,
6150	Hector had laid his hand; around that ship
6150	Trojans and Greeks in mutual slaughter join'd.
6150	The arrow's or the jav'lin's distant flight
6150	They waited not, but, fir'd with equal rage,
6150	Fought hand to hand, with axe and hatchet keen,
6150	And mighty swords, and double-pointed spears.
6150	Many a fair-hilted blade, with iron bound,
6150	Dropp'd from the hands, or from the sever'd arms,
6150	Of warrior chiefs; the dark earth ran with blood:
6150	Yet loos'd not Hector of the stern his hold,
6150	But grasp'd the poop, and on the Trojans call'd;
6150	""
6150	"""Bring fire, and all together loud and clear"
6150	Your war-cry raise; this day will Jove repay
6150	Our labours all, with capture of those ships,
6150	Which hither came, against the will of Heav'n,
6150	And which on us unnumber'd ills have brought,
6150	By our own Elders' fault, who me, desiring
6150	Ev'n at their vessels' sterns to urge the war,
6150	Withheld, and to the town the troops confin'd.
6150	But Jove all-seeing, if he then o'errul'd
6150	"Our better mind, himself is now our aid."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he: they onward press'd with added zeal;
6150	Nor Ajax yet endur'd, by hostile spears
6150	Now sorely gall'd; yet but a little space,
6150	Back to the helmsman's sev'n-foot board he mov'd,
6150	Expecting death; and left the lofty deck,
6150	Where long he stood on guard; but still his spear
6150	The Trojans kept aloof, whoe'er essay'd
6150	Amid the ships to launch th' unwearied flames;
6150	And, loudly shouting, to the Greeks he call'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Friends, Grecian heroes, ministers of Mars,"
6150	Quit ye like men! dear friends, remember now
6150	Your wonted valour! think ye in your rear
6150	To find supporting forces, or some fort
6150	Whose walls may give you refuge from your foe?
6150	No city is nigh, whose well-appointed tow'rs,
6150	Mann'd by a friendly race, may give us aid;
6150	But here, upon the well-arm'd Trojans' soil,
6150	And only resting on the sea, we lie
6150	Far from our country; not in faint retreat,
6150	"But in our own good arms, our safety lies."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and with his sharp-edg'd spear his words
6150	He follow'd up; if any Trojan dar'd,
6150	By Hector's call inspir'd, with fiery brand
6150	To assail the ships, him with his ponderous spear
6150	Would Ajax meet; and thus before the ships
6150	Twelve warriors, hand to hand, his prowess felt.

6150	THE SIXTH BATTLE; THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book)
6150	entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks
6150	with Achilles' troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time
6150	charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without farther
6150	pursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers of
6150	Achilles are described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of
6150	his friend, after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The
6150	Trojans, at the sight of Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for
6150	that hero, are cast into the utmost consternation: he beats them off
6150	from the vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though
6150	Jupiter was averse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle
6150	are described; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders
6150	of Achilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy; where Apollo
6150	repulses and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him:
6150	which concludes the book.

6150	BOOK XVI.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Thus round the well-mann'd ship they wag'd the war:
6150	Meanwhile by Peleus' son Patroclus stood,
6150	Weeping hot tears; as some dark-water'd fount
6150	Pours o'er a craggy rock its gloomy stream;
6150	Achilles, swift of foot, with pity saw,
6150	And to his friend these winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Why weeps Patroclus, like an infant girl,"
6150	That prays her mother, by whose side she runs,
6150	To take her up; and, clinging to her gown,
6150	Impedes her way, and still with tearful eyes
6150	Looks in her face, until she take her up?
6150	Ev'n as that girl, Patroclus, such art thou,
6150	Shedding soft tears: hast thou some tidings brought
6150	Touching the gen'ral weal, or me alone?
6150	Or have some evil news from Phthia come,
6150	Known but to thee? Menoetius, Actor's son,
6150	Yet surely lives; and 'mid his Myrmidons
6150	Lives aged Peleus, son of AEacus:
6150	Their deaths indeed might well demand our tears:
6150	Or weep'st thou for the Greeks, who round their ships
6150	By death their former insolence repay?
6150	"Speak out, that I may know thy cause of grief."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, with bitter groans, Patroclus thus:
6150	"""O son of Peleus, noblest of the Greeks,"
6150	Achilles, be not wroth! such weight of woe
6150	The Grecian camp oppresses; in their ships
6150	They who were late their bravest and their best,
6150	Sore wounded all by spear or arrow lie;
6150	The valiant son of Tydeus, Diomed,
6150	Pierc'd by a shaft, Ulysses by a spear,
6150	And Agamemnon's self; Eurypylus
6150	By a sharp arrow through the thigh transfix'd;
6150	For these, the large resources of their art
6150	The leeches ply, and on their wounds attend;
6150	While thou, Achilles, still remain'st unmov'd.
6150	Oh, be it never mine to nurse such hate
6150	As thou retain'st, inflexibly severe!
6150	Who e'er may hope in future days by thee
6150	To profit, if thou now forbear to save
6150	The Greeks from shame and loss? Unfeeling man!
6150	Sure Peleus, horseman brave, was ne'er thy sire,
6150	Nor Thetis bore thee; from the cold grey sea
6150	And craggy rocks thou hadst thy birth; so hard
6150	And stubborn is thy soul. But if the fear
6150	Of evil prophesied thyself restrain,
6150	Or message by thy Goddess-mother brought
6150	From Jove, yet send me forth with all thy force
6150	Of Myrmidons, to be the saving light
6150	Of Greece; and let me to the battle bear
6150	Thy glitt'ring arms, if so the men of Troy,
6150	Scar'd by thy likeness, may forsake the field,
6150	And breathing-time afford the sons of Greece,
6150	Toil-worn; for little pause has yet been theirs.
6150	Fresh and unwearied, we may drive with ease
6150	To their own city, from our ships and tents,
6150	"The Trojans, worn and battle-wearied men."""
6150	""
6150	Thus pray'd he, all unwisely; for the pray'r
6150	He utter'd, to himself was fraught with death;
6150	To whom, much griev'd, Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""Heav'n-born Patroclus, oh, what words are these!"
6150	Of prophecy I reck not, though I know;
6150	Nor message hath my mother brought from Jove;
6150	But it afflicts my soul; when one I see
6150	That basely robs his equal of his prize,
6150	His lawful prize, by highest valour won;
6150	Such grief is mine, such wrong have I sustain'd.
6150	Her, whom the sons of Greece on me bestow'd,
6150	Prize of my spear, the well-wall'd city storm'd,
6150	The mighty Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
6150	Hath borne by force away, as from the hands
6150	Of some dishonour'd, houseless vagabond.
6150	But let the past be past; I never meant
6150	My wrath should have no end; yet had not thought
6150	My anger to abate, till my own ships
6150	Should hear the war-cry, and the battle bear,
6150	But go, and in my well-known armour clad,
6150	Lead forth the valiant Myrmidons to war,
6150	Since the dark cloud of Trojans circles round
6150	The ships in force; and on the shingly beach,
6150	Pent up in narrow limits, lie the Greeks;
6150	And all the city hath pour'd its numbers forth
6150	In hope undoubting; for they see no more
6150	My helm among them flashing; else in flight
6150	Their dead would choke the streams, if but to me
6150	Great Agamemnon bore a kindly mind:
6150	But round the camp the battle now is wag'd.
6150	No more the hands of valiant Diomed,
6150	The Greeks protecting, hurl his fiery spear;
6150	Nor hear I now, from his detested lips,
6150	The shout of Agamemnon; all around
6150	Is heard the warrior-slayer Hector's voice,
6150	Cheering his Trojans; with triumphant cries
6150	They, from the vanquish'd Greeks, hold all the plain.
6150	Nathless do thou, Patroclus, in defence
6150	Fall boldly on, lest they with blazing fire
6150	Our ships destroy, and hinder our retreat.
6150	But hear, and ponder well the end of all
6150	I have to say, and so for me obtain
6150	Honour and glory in the eyes of Greece;
6150	And that the beauteous maiden to my arms
6150	They may restore, with costly gifts to boot.
6150	The ships reliev'd, return forthwith; and though
6150	The Thund'rer, Juno's Lord, should crown thine arms
6150	With triumph, be not rash, apart from me,
6150	In combat with the warlike sons of Troy;
6150	 (So should my name in less repute be held;)
6150	Nor, in the keen excitement of the fight
6150	And slaughter of the Trojans, lead thy troops
6150	On tow'rd the city, lest thou find thyself
6150	By some one of th' immortal Gods oppos'd;
6150	For the far-darting Phoebus loves them well;
6150	But when in safety thou hast plac'd the ships,
6150	Delay not to return, and leave the rest
6150	To battle on the plain: for would to Jove,
6150	To Pallas and Apollo, that not one,
6150	Or Greek or Trojan, might escape from death,
6150	Save only thou and I; that so we two
6150	"Alone might raze the sacred tow'rs of Troy."""
6150	""
6150	Such converse held they; while by hostile spears
6150	Hard press'd, no longer Ajax might endure;
6150	At once by Jove's high will and Trojan foes
6150	O'ermaster'd; loud beneath repeated blows
6150	Clatter'd around his brow the glitt'ring helm,
6150	As on the well-wrought crest the weapons fell;
6150	And his left arm grew faint, that long had borne
6150	The burthen of his shield; yet nought avail'd
6150	The press of spears to drive him from his post;
6150	Lab'ring he drew his breath, his ev'ry limb
6150	With sweat was reeking; breathing space was none;
6150	Blow follow'd blow; and ills were heap'd on ill.
6150	""
6150	Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell,
6150	How first the fire assail'd the Grecian ships.
6150	""
6150	Hector approach'd, and on the ashen spear
6150	Of Ajax, close behind the head, let fall
6150	His mighty sword; right through he clove the wood;
6150	And in his hand the son of Telamon
6150	The headless shaft held bootless; far away,
6150	Loud ringing, fell to earth the brazen point.
6150	Ajax, dismayed, perceived the hand of Heaven,
6150	And knew that Jove the Thunderer had decreed
6150	To thwart his hopes, and victory give to Troy.
6150	Slow he retir'd; and to the vessel they
6150	The blazing torch applied; high rose the flame
6150	Unquenchable, and wrapp'd the poop in fire.
6150	The son of Peleus saw, and with his palm
6150	Smote on his thigh, and to Patroclus call'd:
6150	"""Up, nobly born Patroclus, car-borne chief!"
6150	Up, for I see above the ships ascend
6150	The hostile fires; and lest they seize the ships,
6150	And hinder our retreat, do thou in haste
6150	"Thine armour don, while I arouse the troops."""
6150	""
6150	He said: his dazzling arms Patroclus donn'd:
6150	First on his legs the well-wrought greaves he fix'd,
6150	Fasten'd with silver clasps; his ample chest
6150	The breastplate of Achilles, swift of foot,
6150	Star-spangled, richly wrought, defended well;
6150	Around his shoulders slung, his sword he bore,
6150	Brass-bladed, silver-studded; next his shield
6150	Weighty and strong; and on his firm-set head
6150	A helm he wore, well-wrought, with horsehair plume
6150	That nodded, fearful, o'er his brow; his hand
6150	Grasp'd two stout spears, familiar to his hold.
6150	One spear Achilles had, long, pond'rous, tough;
6150	But this he touch'd not; none of all the Greeks,
6150	None, save Achilles' self, that spear could poise;
6150	The far-fam'd Pelian ash, which to his sire,
6150	On Pelion's summit fell'd, to be the bane
6150	Of mightiest chiefs, the Centaur Chiron gave.
6150	Then to Automedon he gave command
6150	To yoke the horses: him he honour'd most,
6150	Next to Achilles' self; the trustiest he
6150	In battle to await his chief's behest.
6150	The flying steeds he harness'd to the car,
6150	Xanthus and Balius, fleeter than the winds;
6150	Whom, grazing in the marsh by ocean's stream,
6150	Podarge, swift of foot, to Zephyr bore:
6150	And by their side the matchless Pedasus,
6150	Whom from the capture of Eetion's town
6150	Achilles bore away; a mortal horse,
6150	But with immortal coursers meet to vie.
6150	""
6150	Meantime Achilles, through their several tents,
6150	Summon'd to arms the warlike Myrmidons.
6150	They all, like rav'ning wolves, of courage high,
6150	That on the mountain side have hunted down
6150	An antler'd stag, and batten'd on his flesh:
6150	Their chaps all dyed with blood, in troops they go,
6150	With their lean tongues from some black-water'd fount
6150	To lap the surface of the dark cool wave,
6150	Their jaws with blood yet reeking, unsubdued
6150	Their courage, and their bellies gorg'd with flesh;
6150	So round Pelides' valiant follower throng'd
6150	The chiefs and rulers of the Myrmidons.
6150	Achilles in the midst to charioteers
6150	And buckler'd warriors issued his commands.
6150	Fifty swift ships Achilles, dear to Jove,
6150	Led to the coast of Troy; and rang'd in each
6150	Fifty brave comrades mann'd the rowers' seats.
6150	O'er these five chiefs, on whom he most relied,
6150	He plac'd, himself the Sov'reign Lord of all.
6150	One band Menestheus led, with glancing mail,
6150	Son of Sperchius, Heav'n-descended stream;
6150	Him Peleus' daughter, Polydora fair,
6150	A mortal in a God's embrace compress'd,
6150	To stout Sperchius bore; but, by repute,
6150	To Boras, Perieres' son, who her
6150	In public, and with ample dow'r, espous'd.
6150	The brave Eudorus led the second band,
6150	Whom Phylas' daughter, Polymele fair,
6150	To Hermes bore; the maid he saw, and lov'd,
6150	Amid the virgins, mingling in the dance
6150	Of golden-shafted Dian, Huntress-Queen;
6150	He to her chamber access found, and gain'd
6150	By stealth her bed; a valiant son she bore,
6150	Eudorus, swift of foot, in battle strong.
6150	But when her infant, by Lucina's aid,
6150	Was brought to light, and saw the face of day,
6150	Her to his home, with ample dow'r enrich'd,
6150	Echecles, son of Actor, bore away;
6150	While him the aged Phylas kept, and nurs'd
6150	With tender care, and cherish'd--as his own.
6150	The brave Peisander, son of Maemalus,
6150	The third commanded; of the Myrmidons,
6150	Next to Pelides' friend, the noblest spear.
6150	The fourth, the aged warrior Phoenix led;
6150	The fifth, Alcimedon, Laerces' son:
6150	These in their order due Achilles first
6150	Array'd, and next with stirring words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Ye Myrmidons, forget not now the vaunts"
6150	Which, while my wrath endur'd, ye largely pour'd
6150	Upon the Trojans; me ye freely blam'd;
6150	'Ill-omen'd son of Peleus, sure in wrath
6150	Thou wast conceiv'd, implacable, who here
6150	In idleness enforc'd thy comrades keep'st!
6150	'Twere better far our homeward way to take,
6150	If such pernicious rancour fill thy soul!'
6150	Thus ye reproach'd me oft! Lo! now ye have
6150	The great occasion which your souls desir'd!
6150	"Then on, and with brave hearts the Trojans meet!"""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh courage rous'd in ev'ry breast,
6150	And more compact, beneath their monarch's eye,
6150	Their ranks were form'd; as when the builder lays
6150	The closely-fitting stones, to form the wall
6150	Of some great house, and brave the winds of Heav'n;
6150	So close were fitted helm and bossy shield;
6150	Buckler on buckler press'd, and helm on helm,
6150	And man on man; the horsehair plumes above,
6150	That nodded, fearful, from the warriors' brows,
6150	Each other touch'd; so closely mass'd they stood.
6150	Before them all stood prominent in arms
6150	Two chiefs, Patroclus and Automedon,
6150	Both with one thought possess'd, to lead the fight
6150	In the fore-front of all the Myrmidons.
6150	Achilles then within his tent withdrew,
6150	And of a gorgeous coffer rais'd the lid,
6150	Well-wrought, by silver-footed Thetis plac'd
6150	On board his ship, and fill'd with rich attire,
6150	With store of wind-proof cloaks, and carpets soft.
6150	There lay a goblet, richly chas'd, whence none,
6150	But he alone, might drink the ruddy wine,
6150	Nor might libations thence to other Gods
6150	Be made, save only Jove: this brought he forth,
6150	And first with sulphur purified, and next
6150	Wash'd with pure water; then his hands he wash'd,
6150	And drew the ruddy wine; then standing forth
6150	Made in the centre of the court his pray'r,
6150	And as he pour'd the wine, look'd up to Heav'n,
6150	Not unbeheld of Jove, the lightning's Lord:
6150	""
6150	"""Great King, Dodona's Lord, Pelasgian Jove,"
6150	Who dwell'st on high, and rul'st with sov'reign sway
6150	Dodona's wintry heights; where dwell around
6150	Thy Sellian priests, men of unwashen feet,
6150	That on the bare ground sleep; thou once before
6150	Hast heard my pray'r, and me with honour crown'd,
6150	And on the Greeks inflicted all thy plagues;
6150	Hear yet again, and this my boon accord.
6150	I 'mid the throng of ships myself remain;
6150	But with a num'rous force of Myrmidons
6150	I send my comrade in my stead to fight:
6150	On him, all-seeing Jove, thy favour pour;
6150	Strengthen his heart, that Hector's self may learn
6150	If, e'en alone, my follower knows to fight,
6150	Or only then resistless pow'r displays,
6150	When I myself the toil of battle share.
6150	And from our vessels when the foe is driv'n,
6150	Grant that with all his arms and comrades true
6150	"He may in safety to the ships return."""
6150	""
6150	Thus pray'd he; Jove, the Lord of counsel, heard,
6150	And half his pray'r he granted, half denied:
6150	For from the ships the battle to repel
6150	He granted; but denied his safe return.
6150	His pray'rs and off'rings ended, to the tent
6150	Achilles turn'd again, and in the chest
6150	Replac'd the cup; then issuing forth, he stood
6150	Before the tent; for much he long'd to see
6150	The Greeks and Trojans join in battle strife.
6150	They who in arms round brave Patroclus stood
6150	Their line of battle form'd, with courage high
6150	To dash upon the Trojans; and as wasps
6150	That have their nest beside the public road,
6150	Which boys delight to vex and irritate
6150	In wanton play, but to the gen'ral harm;
6150	Them if some passing trav'ller unawares
6150	Disturb, with angry courage forth they rush
6150	In one continuous swarm, to guard their nest:
6150	E'en with such courage pour'd the Myrmidons
6150	Forth from the ships; then uproar wild arose,
6150	And loud Patroclus on his comrades call'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Ye valiant Myrmidons, who boast yourselves"
6150	Achilles' comrades, quit ye now like men;
6150	Your ancient valour prove; to Peleus' son,
6150	Of all the Greeks the noblest, so shall we,
6150	His faithful followers, highest honour give;
6150	And Agamemnon's haughty self shall mourn
6150	"The slight on Grecia's bravest warrior cast."""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh courage rous'd in ev'ry breast.
6150	Thick on the Trojan host their masses fell;
6150	While loud the fleet re-echoed to the sound
6150	Of Grecian cheers; but when the Trojans saw,
6150	Blazing in arms, Menoetius' godlike son,
6150	Himself, and follower; quail'd the spirits of all;
6150	Their firm-set ranks were shaken; for they deem'd
6150	Achilles had beside the ships exchang'd
6150	His wrath for friendship; and each sev'ral man
6150	Look'd round, to find his own escape from death.
6150	""
6150	Then first Patroclus aim'd his glitt'ring spear
6150	Amid the crowd, where thickest round the ships
6150	Of brave Protesilaus, raged the war;
6150	And struck Pyraechmes, who from Amydon,
6150	From the wide-flowing stream of Axius, led
6150	The horsehair-crested Paeons; him he struck
6150	Through the right shoulder; backwards in the dust
6150	Groaning, he fell; around him quail'd with fear
6150	His Paeons all, such terror in their ranks
6150	Patroclus threw, their bravest leader slain,
6150	The foremost in the fight; the crowd he drove
6150	Far from the ships, and quench'd the blazing fire.
6150	There lay the half-burnt ship; with shouts confus'd
6150	The Trojans fled; and from amid the ships
6150	Forth pour'd the Greeks; and loud the clamour rose.
6150	""
6150	As when around a lofty mountain's top
6150	The lightning's Lord dispels a mass of cloud,
6150	And ev'ry crag, and ev'ry jutting peak
6150	Is plainly seen, and ev'ry forest glade;
6150	And the deep vault of Heav'n is open'd wide;
6150	So when the Greeks had clear'd the ships of fire,
6150	They breath'd awhile; yet ceas'd not so the strife;
6150	For not in headlong panic from the ships
6150	The Trojans by the valiant Greeks were driv'n,
6150	But, though perforce retiring, still made head.
6150	""
6150	Then of the chiefs, as wider spread the fight,
6150	Each singled each; Menoetius' noble son
6150	First threw his pointed spear, and on the thigh
6150	Struck Areilochus, in act to turn;
6150	Right through the point was driv'n; the weighty spear
6150	Shatter'd the bone, and prone to earth he fell.
6150	The warlike Menelaus aim'd his spear
6150	Where Thoas' breast, unguarded by his shield,
6150	Was left expos'd; and slack'd his limbs in death.
6150	Phyleus' brave son, as rush'd Amphiclus on,
6150	Stood firm, with eye observant; then th' attack
6150	Preventing, through his thigh, high up, where lie
6150	The strongest muscles, smote; the weapon's point
6150	Sever'd the tendons; darkness clos'd his eyes.
6150	Of Nestor's sons, Antilochus, the first,
6150	Atymnius wounded, driving through his flank
6150	He brazen spear; prone on his face he fell.
6150	Then, burning to avenge his brother's death,
6150	Stood Maris o'er the corpse, and hand to hand
6150	Engaged Antilochus; but ere a blow
6150	Was struck, the godlike Thrasymedes drove
6150	Through his right shoulder, with unerring aim,
6150	His glitt'ring spear; the point his upper arm
6150	Tore from the muscles, shatt'ring all the bone:
6150	Thund'ring he fell, and darkness clos'd his eyes.
6150	So to the shades, by those two brethren's hands
6150	Subdued, Sarpedon's comrades brave were sent,
6150	The sons of Amisodarus, who rear'd
6150	The dread Chimaera, bane of mortal men.
6150	On Cleobulus, wounded in the press,
6150	Ajax Oileus sprang, and captive took,
6150	Alive; but sudden on his neck let fall
6150	His hilted sword, and quench'd the fire of life.
6150	The hot blood dyed the sword; the darkling shades
6150	Of death, and rig'rous fate, his eyes o'erspread.
6150	Then Peneleus and Lycon, hand to hand,
6150	Engag'd in combat; both had miss'd their aim,
6150	And bootless hurl'd their weapons; then with swords
6150	They met; first Lycon on the crested helm
6150	Dealt a fierce blow; but in his hand the blade
6150	Up to the hilt was shiver'd; then the sword
6150	Of Peneleus his neck, below the ear,
6150	Dissever'd; deeply in his throat the blade
6150	Was plung'd, and by the skin alone was stay'd;
6150	Down droop'd his head, his limbs relax'd in death.
6150	Meriones by speed of foot o'ertook,
6150	And, as his car he mounted, Acarnas
6150	Though the right shoulder pierc'd; down from the car
6150	He fell; the shades of death his eyes o'erspread.
6150	Full on the mouth of Erymas was thrust
6150	The weapon of Idomeneus; right through,
6150	The white bones crashing, pass'd the brazen spear
6150	Below the brain; his teeth were shatter'd all;
6150	With blood, which with convulsive sobs he blew
6150	From mouth and nostril, both his eyes were fill'd;
6150	And death's dark cloud encompass'd him around.
6150	Thus slew the Grecian leaders each his man.
6150	""
6150	As rav'ning wolves, that lambs or kids assail,
6150	Stray'd from their dams, by careless shepherds left
6150	Upon the mountain scatter'd; these they see,
6150	And tear at once their unresisting prey;
6150	So on the Trojans fell the Greeks; in rout
6150	Disastrous they, unmann'd by terror, fled.
6150	Great Ajax still, unwearied, long'd to hurl
6150	His spear at Hector of the brazen helm;
6150	But he, well skill'd in war, his shoulders broad
6150	Protected by his shield of tough bull's hide,
6150	Watch'd for the whizzing shafts, and jav'lins' whirr.
6150	Full well he knew the tide of battle turn'd,
6150	Yet held his ground, his trusty friends to save.
6150	""
6150	As from Olympus, o'er the clear blue sky
6150	Pour the dark clouds, when Jove the vault of Heav'n
6150	O'erspreads with storm and tempest, from the ships
6150	So pour'd with panic cries the flying host,
6150	And in disorder'd rout recross'd the trench.
6150	Then Hector's flying coursers bore him safe
6150	Far from the struggling masses, whom the ditch
6150	Detain'd perforce; there many a royal car
6150	With broken pole th' unharness'd horses left.
6150	On, shouting to the Greeks, Patroclus press'd
6150	The flying Trojans; they, with panic cries,
6150	Dispers'd, the roads encumber'd; high uprose
6150	The storms of dust, as from the tents and ships
6150	Back to the city stretch'd the flying steeds;
6150	And ever where the densest throng appear'd
6150	With furious threats Patroclus urg'd his course;
6150	His glowing axle trac'd by prostrate men
6150	Hurl'd from their cars, and chariots overthrown.
6150	Flew o'er the deep-sunk trench th' immortal steeds,
6150	The noble prize the Gods to Peleus gave,
6150	Still onward straining; for he long'd to reach,
6150	And hurl his spear at Hector; him meanwhile
6150	His flying steeds in safety bore away.
6150	""
6150	As in th' autumnal season, when the earth
6150	With weight of rain is saturate; when Jove
6150	Pours down his fiercest storms in wrath to men,
6150	Who in their courts unrighteous judgments pass,
6150	And justice yield to lawless violence,
6150	The wrath of Heav'n despising; ev'ry stream
6150	Is brimming o'er: the hills in gullies deep
6150	Are by the torrents seam'd, which, rushing down
6150	From the high mountains to the dark-blue sea,
6150	With groans and tumult urge their headlong course,
6150	Wasting the works of man; so urg'd their flight,
6150	So, as they fled, the Trojan horses groan'd.
6150	The foremost ranks cut off, back tow'rd the ships
6150	Patroclus drove them, baffling their attempts
6150	To gain the city; and in middle space
6150	Between the ships, the stream, and lofty wall,
6150	Dealt slaughter round him, and of many a chief
6150	The bitter penalty of death requir'd.
6150	Then Pronous with his glitt'ring spear he struck,
6150	Where by the shield his breast was left expos'd,
6150	And slack'd his limbs in death; thund'ring he fell.
6150	Next Thestor, son of OEnops, he assail'd;
6150	He on his polish'd car, down-crouching, sat,
6150	His mind by fear disorder'd; from his hands
6150	The reins had dropp'd; him, thrusting with the spear,
6150	Through the right cheek and through the teeth he smote,
6150	Then dragg'd him, by the weapon, o'er the rail.
6150	As when an angler on a prominent rock
6150	Drags from the sea to shore with hook and line
6150	A weighty fish; so him Patroclus dragg'd,
6150	Gaping, from off the car; and dash'd him down
6150	Upon his face; and life forsook his limbs.
6150	Next Eryalus, eager for the fray,
6150	On the mid forehead with a mighty stone
6150	He struck; beneath the pond'rous helmet's weight
6150	The skull was split in twain; prostrate he fell,
6150	By life-consuming death encompass'd round.
6150	Forthwith Amphoterus, and Erymas,
6150	Epaltes, Echius, and Tlepolemus,
6150	Son of Damastor, Pyris, Ipheus brave,
6150	Euippus, Polymelus, Argeas' son,
6150	In quick succession to the ground he brought.
6150	Sarpedon his ungirdled forces saw
6150	Promiscuous fall before Menoetius' son,
6150	And to the Lycians call'd in loud reproof:
6150	"""Shame, Lycians! whither fly ye? why this haste?"
6150	I will myself this chief confront, and learn
6150	Who this may be of bearing proud and high,
6150	Who on the Trojans grievous harm hath wrought,
6150	"And many a warrior's limbs relax'd in death."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and from his car, accoutred, sprang;
6150	Patroclus saw, and he too leap'd to earth.
6150	As on a lofty rock, with angry screams,
6150	Hook-beak'd, with talons curv'd, two vultures fight;
6150	So with loud shouts these two to battle rush'd.
6150	The son of Saturn pitying saw, and thus
6150	To Juno spoke, his sister and his wife:
6150	""
6150	"""Woe, woe! that fate decrees my best-belov'd,"
6150	Sarpedon, by Patroclus' hand to fall;
6150	E'en now conflicting thoughts my soul divide,
6150	To bear him from the fatal strife unhurt,
6150	And set him down on Lycia's fertile plains,
6150	"Or leave him by Patroclus' hand to fall."""
6150	""
6150	Whom, answer'd thus the stag-ey'd Queen of Heav'n:
6150	"""What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
6150	Wouldst thou a mortal man from death withdraw
6150	Long since by fate decreed? Do what thou wilt;
6150	Yet cannot we, the rest, applaud thine act.
6150	This too I say, and turn it in thy mind:
6150	If to his home Sarpedon thou restore
6150	Alive, bethink thee, will not other Gods
6150	Their sons too from the stubborn fight withdraw?
6150	For in the field around the walls of Troy
6150	Are many sons of Gods, in all of whom
6150	This act of thine will angry feelings rouse.
6150	But if thou love him, and thy soul deplore
6150	His coming doom, yet in the stubborn fight
6150	Leave him beneath Patroclus' hand to fall:
6150	Then, when his spirit hath fled, the charge assign
6150	To Death and gentle Sleep, that in their arms
6150	They bear him safe to Lycia's wide-spread plains:
6150	There shall his brethren and his friends perform
6150	His fun'ral rites, and mound and column raise,
6150	"The fitting tribute to the mighty dead."""
6150	""
6150	Thus she; the Sire of Gods and men complied:
6150	But to the ground some drops of blood let fall,
6150	In honour of his son, whom fate decreed,
6150	Far from his country, on the fertile plains
6150	Of Troy to perish by Patroclus' hand.
6150	As near the champions drew, Patroclus first
6150	His weapon hurl'd, and Thrasymedes brave,
6150	The faithful follower of Sarpedon, struck
6150	Below the waist, and slack'd his limbs in death.
6150	Thrown in his turn, Sarpedon's glitt'ring spear
6150	Flew wide; and Pedasus, the gallant horse,
6150	Through the right shoulder wounded; with a scream
6150	He fell, and in the dust breath'd forth his life,
6150	As, shrieking loud, his noble spirit fled.
6150	This way and that his two companions swerv'd;
6150	Creak'd the strong yoke, and tangled were the reins,
6150	As in the dust the prostrate courser lay.
6150	Automedon the means of safety saw;
6150	And drawing from beside his brawny thigh
6150	His keen-edg'd sword, with no uncertain blow
6150	Cut loose the fallen horse; again set straight,
6150	The two, extended, stretch'd the tightened rein.
6150	Again in mortal strife the warriors clos'd:
6150	Once more Sarpedon hurl'd his glitt'ring spear
6150	In vain; above Patroclus' shoulder flew
6150	The point, innocuous; from his hand in turn
6150	The spear not vainly thrown, Sarpedon struck
6150	Where lies the diaphragm, below the heart.
6150	He fell; as falls an oak, or poplar tall,
6150	Or lofty pine, which on the mountain top
6150	For some proud ship the woodman's axe hath hewn:
6150	So he, with death-cry sharp, before his car
6150	Extended lay, and clutch'd the blood-stain'd soil.
6150	As when a lion on the herd has sprung,
6150	And, 'mid the heifers seiz'd, the lordly bull
6150	Lies bellowing, crush'd between the lion's jaws;
6150	So by Patroclus slain, the Lycian chief,
6150	Undaunted still, his faithful comrade call'd:
6150	"""Good Glaucus, warrior tried, behoves thee now"
6150	Thy spearmanship to prove, and warlike might.
6150	Welcome the fray; put forth thine utmost speed;
6150	Call on the Lycian chiefs, on ev'ry side,
6150	To press around, and for Sarpedon fight;
6150	Thou too thine arms for my protection wield;
6150	For I to thee, through all thy future days,
6150	Shall be a ceaseless scandal and reproach,
6150	If me, thus slain before the Grecian ships,
6150	The Greeks be suffer'd of my arms to spoil:
6150	"But stand thou fast, and others' courage raise."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, the shades of death o'erspread
6150	His eyes and nostrils; then with foot firm-set
6150	Upon his chest, Patroclus from the corpse
6150	Drew, by main force, the fast-adhering spear;
6150	The life forth issuing with the weapon's point.
6150	Loos'd from the royal car, the snorting steeds,
6150	Eager for flight, the Myrmidons detain'd.
6150	Deep-grieving, Glaucus heard his voice: and chafed
6150	His spirit within him, that he lacked the power
6150	To aid his comrade; with his hand he grasp'd
6150	His wounded arm, in torture from the shaft
6150	By Teucer shot, to save the Greeks from death,
6150	As on he pressed to scale the lofty wall:
6150	Then to Apollo thus address'd his pray'r:
6150	""
6150	"""Hear me, great King, who, as on Lycia's plains,"
6150	Art here in Troy; and hear'st in ev'ry place
6150	Their voice who suffer, as I suffer now.
6150	A grievous wound I bear, and sharpest pangs
6150	My arm assail, nor may the blood he stanch'd:
6150	The pain weighs down my shoulder; and my hand
6150	Hath lost its pow'r to fight, or grasp my spear.
6150	Sarpedon, bravest of the brave, is slain,
6150	The son of Jove; yet Jove preserv'd him not.
6150	But thou, O King, this grievous wound relieve;
6150	Assuage the pain, and give me strength to urge
6150	My Lycian comrades to maintain the war,
6150	"And fight myself to guard the noble dead."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he pray'd, his pray'r Apollo heard,
6150	Assuag'd his pains, and from the grievous wound
6150	Stanch' d the dark blood, and fill'd his soul with strength.
6150	Glaucus within himself perceiv'd, and knew,
6150	Rejoicing, that the God had heard his pray'r.
6150	The Lycian leaders first on ev'ry side
6150	He urg'd to hasten for their King to fight:
6150	Then 'mid the Trojans went with lofty step,
6150	And first to Panthous' son, Polydamas,
6150	To brave Agenor and AEneas next;
6150	Then Hector of the brazen helm himself
6150	Approaching, thus with winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, forgett'st thou quite thy brave allies,"
6150	Who freely in thy cause pour forth their lives,
6150	Far from their home and friends? but they from thee
6150	No aid receive; Sarpedon lies in death,
6150	The leader of the buckler'd Lycian bands,
6150	Whose justice and whose pow'r were Lycia's shield;
6150	Him by Patroclus' hand hath Mars subdued.
6150	But, friends, stand by me now! with just revenge
6150	Inspir'd, determine that the Myrmidons
6150	Shall not, how griev'd soe'er for all the Greeks
6150	Who by our spears beside the ships have fall'n,
6150	"Our dead dishonour, and his arms obtain."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and through the Trojans thrill'd the sense
6150	Of grief intolerable, unrestrain'd;
6150	For he, though stranger-born, was of the State
6150	A mighty pillar; and his followers
6150	A num'rous host; and he himself in fight
6150	Among the foremost; so, against the Greeks,
6150	With fiery zeal they rush'd, by Hector led,
6150	Griev'd for Sarpedon's loss; on th' other side
6150	Patroclus' manly heart the Greeks arous'd,
6150	And to th' Ajaces first, themselves inflamed
6150	With warlike zeal, he thus address'd his speech:
6150	""
6150	"""Ye sons of Ajax, now is come the time"
6150	Your former fame to rival, or surpass:
6150	The man hath fall'n, who first o'erleap'd our wall,
6150	Sarpedon; now remains, that, having slain,
6150	We should his corpse dishonour, and his arms
6150	Strip off; and should some comrade dare attempt
6150	"His rescue, him too with our spears subdue."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and they, with martial ardour fir'd,
6150	Rush'd to the conflict. When on either side
6150	The reinforc'd battalions were array'd,
6150	Trojans and Lycians, Myrmidons and Greeks
6150	Around the dead in sternest combat met,
6150	With fearful shouts; and loud their armour rang.
6150	Then, to enhance the horror of the strife
6150	Around his son, with darkness Jove o'erspread
6150	The stubborn fight: the Trojans first drove back
6150	The keen-ey'd Greeks; for first a warrior fell,
6150	Not of the meanest 'mid the Myrmidons,
6150	Epegeus, son of valiant Agacles;
6150	Who in Budaeum's thriving state bore rule
6150	Erewhile; but flying for a kinsman slain,
6150	To Peleus and the silver-footed Queen
6150	He came a suppliant; with Achilles thence
6150	To Ilium sent, to join the war of Troy.
6150	Him, as he stretch'd his hand to seize the dead,
6150	Full on the forehead with a massive stone
6150	Great Hector smote; within the pond'rous helm
6150	The skull was split in twain; prone on the corpse
6150	He fell, by life-destroying death subdued.
6150	Griev'd was Patroclus for his comrade slain;
6150	Forward he darted, as a swift-wing'd hawk,
6150	That swoops amid the starlings and the daws;
6150	So swift didst thou, Patroclus, car-borne chief,
6150	Upon the Trojans and the Lycians spring,
6150	Thy soul with anger for thy comrade fill'd.
6150	A pond'rous stone he hurl'd at Sthenelas,
6150	Son of Ithaemenes; the mighty mass
6150	Fell on his neck, and all the muscles crush'd.
6150	Back drew great Hector and the chiefs of Troy;
6150	Far as a jav'lin's flight, in sportive strife,
6150	Or in the deadly battle, hurl'd by one
6150	His utmost strength exerting; back so far
6150	The Trojans drew, so far the Greeks pursued.
6150	Glaucus, the leader of the Lycian spears,
6150	First turning, slew the mighty Bathycles,
6150	The son of Chalcon; he in Hellas dwelt,
6150	In wealth surpassing all the Myrmidons.
6150	Him, as he gain'd upon him in pursuit,
6150	Quick turning, Glaucus through the breast transfix'd;
6150	Thund'ring he fell; deep grief possess'd the Greeks
6150	At loss of one so valiant; fiercely joy'd
6150	The Trojans, and around him crowded thick;
6150	Nor of their wonted valour were the Greeks
6150	Oblivious, but still onward held their course.
6150	Then slew Meriones a crested chief,
6150	The bold Laogonus, Onetor's son;
6150	Onetor, of Idaean Jove the priest,
6150	And by the people as a God rever'd.
6150	Below the ear he struck him; from his limbs
6150	The spirit fled, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
6150	""
6150	Then at Meriones AEneas threw
6150	His brazen spear, in hopes beneath his shield
6150	To find a spot unguarded; he beheld,
6150	And downward stooping, shunn'd the brazen death;
6150	Behind him far, deep in the soil infix'd,
6150	The weapon stood; there Mars its impulse stay'd;
6150	So, bootless hurl'd, though by no feeble hand,
6150	AEneas' spear stood quiv'ring in the ground;
6150	"Then thus in wrath he cried: ""Meriones,"
6150	Had it but struck thee, nimble as thou art,
6150	"My spear had brought thy dancing to a close."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the spearman skill'd, Meriones:
6150	"""Brave as thou art, AEneas, 'tis too much"
6150	For thee to hope the might of all to quell,
6150	Who dare confront thee; thou art mortal too!
6150	And if my aim be true, and should my spear
6150	But strike thee fair, all valiant as thou art,
6150	And confident, yet me thy fall shall crown
6150	"With triumph, and thy soul to Hades send."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and him Menoetius' noble son
6150	"Address'd with grave rebuke: ""Meriones,"
6150	Brave warrior, why thus waste the time in words?
6150	Trust me, good friend, 'tis not by vaunting speech,
6150	Unseconded by deeds, that we may hope
6150	To scare away the Trojans from the slain:
6150	Hands are for battle, words for council meet;
6150	"Boots it not now to wrangle, but to fight."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and led the way; him follow'd straight
6150	The godlike chief; forthwith, as loudly rings,
6150	Amid the mountain forest's deep recess,
6150	The woodman's axe, and far is heard the sound;
6150	So from the wide-spread earth their clamour rose,
6150	As brazen arms, and shields, and tough bull's-hide
6150	Encounter'd swords and double-pointed spears.
6150	Nor might the sharpest sight Sarpedon know,
6150	From head to foot with wounds and blood and dust
6150	Disfigur'd; thickly round the dead they swarm'd.
6150	As when at spring-tide in the cattle-sheds
6150	Around the milk-cans swarm the buzzing flies,
6150	While the warm milk is frothing in the pail;
6150	So swarm'd they round the dead; nor Jove the while
6150	Turn'd from the stubborn fight his piercing glance;
6150	But still look'd down with gaze intent, and mus'd
6150	Upon Patroclus' coming fate, in doubt,
6150	If he too there beside Sarpedon slain,
6150	Should perish by illustrious Hector's hand,
6150	Spoil'd of his arms; or yet be spared awhile
6150	To swell the labours of the battle-field.
6150	He judg'd it best at length, that once again
6150	The gallant follower of Peleus' son
6150	Should tow'rd the town with fearful slaughter drive
6150	The Trojans, and their brazen-helmed chief.
6150	First Hector's soul with panic fear he fill'd;
6150	Mounting his car, he fled, and urg'd to flight
6150	The Trojans; for he saw the scales of Jove.
6150	Then nor the valiant Lycians held their ground;
6150	All fled in terror, as they saw their King
6150	Pierc'd through the heart, amid a pile of dead;
6150	For o'er his body many a warrior fell,
6150	When Saturn's son the conflict fierce inflam'd.
6150	Then from Sarpedon's breast they stripp'd his arms,
6150	Of brass refulgent; these Menoetius' son
6150	Sent by his comrades to the ships of Greece.
6150	""
6150	To Phoebus then the Cloud-compeller thus:
6150	"""Hie thee, good Phoebus, from amid the spears"
6150	Withdraw Sarpedon, and from all his wounds
6150	Cleanse the dark gore; then bear him far away,
6150	And lave his body in the flowing stream;
6150	Then with divine ambrosia all his limbs
6150	Anointing, clothe him in immortal robes.
6150	To two swift bearers give him then in charge,
6150	To Sleep and Death, twin brothers, in their arms
6150	To bear him safe to Lycia's wide-spread plains:
6150	There shall his brethren and his friends perform
6150	His fun'ral rites, and mound and column raise,
6150	"The fitting tribute to the mighty dead."""
6150	""
6150	He said; obedient to his father's words,
6150	Down to the battle-field Apollo sped
6150	From Ida's height; and from amid the spears
6150	Withdrawn, he bore Sarpedon far away,
6150	And lav'd his body in the flowing stream;
6150	Then with divine ambrosia all his limbs
6150	Anointing, cloth'd him in immortal robes;
6150	To two swift bearers gave him then in charge,
6150	To Sleep and Death, twin brothers; in their arms
6150	They bore him safe to Lycia's wide-spread plains.
6150	""
6150	Then to Automedon Patroclus gave
6150	His orders, and the flying foe pursued.
6150	Oh much deceiv'd, insensate! had he now
6150	But borne in mind the words of Peleus' son,
6150	He might have 'scap'd the bitter doom of death.
6150	But still Jove's will the will of man o'errules:
6150	Who strikes with panic, and of vict'ry robs
6150	The bravest; and anon excites to war;
6150	Who now Patroclus' breast with fury fill'd.
6150	Whom then, Patroclus, first, whom slew'st thou last,
6150	When summon'd by the Gods to meet thy doom?
6150	Adrastus, and Autonous, Perimus
6150	The son of Meges, and Echeclus next;
6150	Epistor, Melanippus, Elasus,
6150	And Mulius, and Pylartes; these he slew;
6150	The others all in flight their safety found.
6150	""
6150	Then had the Greeks the lofty-gated town
6150	Of Priam captur'd by Patroclus' hand,
6150	So forward and so fierce he bore his spear;
6150	But on the well-built tow'r Apollo stood,
6150	On his destruction bent, and Troy's defence
6150	The jutting angle of the lofty wall
6150	Patroclus thrice assail'd; his onset thrice
6150	Apollo, with his own immortal hands
6150	Repelling, backward thrust his glitt'ring shield.
6150	But when again, with more than mortal force
6150	He made his fourth attempt, with awful mien
6150	And threat'ning voice the Far-destroyer spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Back, Heav'n-born chief, Patroclus! not to thee"
6150	Hath fate decreed the triumph to destroy
6150	The warlike Trojans' city; no, nor yet
6150	"To great Achilles, mightier far than thou."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, Patroclus backward stepp'd,
6150	Shrinking before the Far-destroyer's wrath.
6150	Still Hector kept before the Scaean gates
6150	His coursers; doubtful, if again to dare
6150	The battle-throng, or summon all the host
6150	To seek the friendly shelter of the wall.
6150	Thus as he mus'd, beside him Phoebus stood,
6150	In likeness of a warrior stout and brave,
6150	Brother of Hecuba, the uncle thence
6150	Of noble Hector, Asius, Dymas' son;
6150	Who dwelt in Phrygia, by Saugarius' stream;
6150	His form assuming, thus Apollo spoke:
6150	"""Hector, why shrink'st thou from the battle thus?"
6150	It ill beseems thee! Would to Heav'n that I
6150	So far thy greater were, as thou art mine;
6150	Then sorely shouldst thou rue this abstinence.
6150	But, forward thou! against Patroclus urge
6150	Thy fiery steeds, so haply by his death
6150	"Apollo thee with endless fame may crown."""
6150	""
6150	This said, the God rejoin'd the strife of men;
6150	And noble Hector bade Cebriones
6150	Drive 'mid the fight his car; before him mov'd
6150	Apollo, scatt'ring terror 'mid the Greeks,
6150	And lustre adding to the arms of Troy.
6150	All others Hector pass'd unnotic'd by,
6150	Nor stay'd to slay; Patroclus was the mark
6150	At which his coursers' clatt'ring hoofs he drove.
6150	On th' other side, Patroclus from his car
6150	Leap'd to the ground: his left hand held his spear;
6150	And in the right a pond'rous mass he bore
6150	Of rugged stone, that fill'd his ample grasp:
6150	The stone he hurl'd; not far it miss'd its mark,
6150	Nor bootless flew; but Hector's charioteer
6150	It struck, Cebriones, a bastard son
6150	Of royal Priam, as the reins he held.
6150	Full on his temples fell the jagged mass,
6150	Drove both his eyebrows in, and crush'd the bone;
6150	Before him in the dust his eyeballs fell;
6150	And, like a diver, from the well-wrought car
6150	Headlong he plung'd; and life forsook his limbs.
6150	O'er whom Patroclus thus with bitter jest:
6150	"""Heav'n! what agility! how deftly thrown"
6150	That somersault! if only in the sea
6150	Such feats he wrought, with him might few compete,
6150	Diving for oysters, if with such a plunge
6150	He left his boat, how rough soe'er the waves,
6150	As from his car he plunges to the ground:
6150	"Troy can, it seems, accomplish'd tumblers boast."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, on Cebriones he sprang,
6150	As springs a lion, through the breast transfix'd,
6150	In act the sheepfold to despoil, and dies
6150	The victim of his courage; so didst thou
6150	Upon Cebriones, Patroclus, spring.
6150	Down from his car too Hector leap'd to earth.
6150	So, o'er Cebriones, oppos'd they stood;
6150	As on the mountain, o'er a slaughter'd stag,
6150	Both hunger-pinch'd, two lions fiercely fight,
6150	So o'er Cebriones two mighty chiefs,
6150	Menoetius' son and noble Hector, strove,
6150	Each in the other bent to plunge his spear.
6150	The head, with grasp unyielding, Hector held;
6150	Patroclus seiz'd the foot; and, crowding round,
6150	Trojans and Greeks in stubborn conflict clos'd.
6150	As when, encount'ring in some mountain-glen,
6150	Eurus and Notus shake the forest deep,
6150	Of oak, or ash, or slender cornel-tree,
6150	Whose tap'ring branches are together thrown,
6150	With fearful din, and crash of broke a boughs;
6150	So mix'd confus'dly, Greeks and Trojans fought,
6150	No thought of flight by either entertain'd.
6150	Thick o'er Cebriones the jav'lins flew,
6150	And feather'd arrows, bounding from the string;
6150	And pond'rous stones that on the bucklers rang,
6150	As round the dead they fought; amid the dust
6150	That eddying rose, his art forgotten all,
6150	A mighty warrior, mightily he lay.
6150	While in mid Heav'n the sun pursued his course,
6150	Thick flew the shafts, and fast the people fell
6150	On either side; but when declining day
6150	Brought on the hour that sees the loosen'd steers,
6150	The Greeks were stronger far; and from the darts
6150	And Trojan battle-cry Cebriones
6150	They drew, and from his breast his armour stripp'd.
6150	Fiercely Patroclus on the Trojans fell:
6150	Thrice he assail'd them, terrible as Mars,
6150	With fearful shouts; and thrice nine foes he slew:
6150	But when again, with more than mortal force
6150	His fourth assault he made, thy term of life,
6150	Patroclus, then approach'd its final close;
6150	For Phoebus' awful self encounter'd thee,
6150	Amid the battle-throng, of thee unseen,
6150	For thickest darkness shrouded all his form:
6150	He stood behind, and with extended palm
6150	Dealt on Patroclus' neck and shoulders broad
6150	A mighty buffet; dizzy swam his eyes,
6150	And from his head Apollo snatch'd the helm;
6150	Clank'd, as it roll'd beneath the horses' feet,
6150	The visor'd helm; the horsehair plume with blood
6150	And dust polluted; never till that day
6150	Was that proud helmet so with dust defil'd,
6150	That wont to deck a godlike chief, and guard
6150	Achilles' noble head, and graceful brow:
6150	Now by the will of Jove to Hector giv'n.
6150	Now death was near at hand; and in his grasp
6150	His spear was shiver'd, pond'rous, long, and tough,
6150	Brass-pointed; with its belt, the ample shield
6150	Fell from his shoulders; and Apollo's hand,
6150	The royal son of Jove, his corslet loos'd.
6150	Then was his mind bewilder'd; and his limbs
6150	Gave way beneath him; all aghast he stood:
6150	Him, from behind, a Dardan, Panthous' son,
6150	Euphorbus, peerless 'mid the Trojan youth,
6150	To hurl the spear, to run, to drive the car,
6150	Approaching close, between the shoulders stabb'd;
6150	He, train'd to warfare, from his car, ere this
6150	A score of Greeks had from their chariots hurl'd:
6150	Such was the man who thee, Patroclus, first
6150	Wounded, but not subdued; the ashen spear
6150	He, in all haste, withdrew; nor dar'd confront
6150	Patroclus, though disarm'd, in deadly strife.
6150	""
6150	Back to his comrades' shelt'ring ranks retir'd,
6150	From certain death, Patroclus: by the stroke
6150	Of Phoebus vanquish'd, and Euphorbus' spear:
6150	But Hector, when Patroclus from the fight
6150	He saw retreating, wounded, through the ranks
6150	Advancing, smote him through the flank; right through
6150	The brazen spear was driv'n; thund'ring he fell;
6150	And deeply mourn'd his fall the Grecian host.
6150	""
6150	As when a lion hath in fight o'erborne
6150	A tusked boar, when on the mountain top
6150	They two have met, in all their pride of strength,
6150	Both parch'd with thirst, around a scanty spring;
6150	And vanquish'd by the lion's force, the boar
6150	Hath yielded, gasping; so Menoetius' son,
6150	Great deeds achiev'd, at length beneath the spear
6150	Of noble Hector yielded up his life;
6150	Who o'er the vanquish'd, thus exulting, spoke:
6150	"""Patroclus, but of late thou mad'st thy boast"
6150	To raze our city walls, and in your ships
6150	To bear away to your far-distant land,
6150	Their days of freedom lost, our Trojan dames:
6150	Fool that thou wast! nor knew'st, in their defence,
6150	That Hector's flying coursers scour'd the plain;
6150	From them, the bravest of the Trojans, I
6150	Avert the day of doom; while on our shores
6150	Thy flesh shall glut the carrion birds of Troy.
6150	Poor wretch! though brave he be, yet Peleus' son
6150	Avail'd thee nought, when, hanging back himself,
6150	With sage advice he sent thee forth to fight:
6150	'Come not to me, Patroclus, car-borne chief,
6150	Nor to the ships return, until thou bear
6150	The warrior-slayer Hector's bloody spoils,
6150	Torn from his body;' such were, I suppose,
6150	"His counsels; thou, poor fool, becam'st his dupe."""
6150	To whom Patroclus thus in accents faint:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, thou boastest loudly now, that Jove,"
6150	With Phoebus join'd, hath thee with vict'ry crown'd:
6150	They wrought my death, who stripp'd me of my arms.
6150	Had I to deal with twenty such as thee,
6150	They all should perish, vanquish'd by my spear:
6150	Me fate hath slain, and Phoebus; and, of men,
6150	Euphorbus; thou wast but the third to strike.
6150	This too I say, and bear it in thy mind;
6150	Not long shalt thou survive me; death e'en now
6150	And final doom hangs o'er thee, by the hand
6150	"Of great Achilles, Peleus' matchless son."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, the gloom of death his eyes
6150	O'erspread, and to the shades his spirit fled,
6150	Mourning his fate, his youth and strength cut off.
6150	To whom, though dead, the noble Hector thus:
6150	"""Patroclus, why predict my coming fate?"
6150	Or who can say but fair-hair'd Thetis' son,
6150	"Achilles, by my spear may first be slain?"""
6150	""
6150	He said, and planting firm his foot, withdrew
6150	The brazen spear, and backward drove the dead
6150	From off the weapon's point; then, spear in hand,
6150	Intent to slay, Automedon pursued,
6150	The godlike follower of AEacides:
6150	But him in safety bore th' immortal steeds,
6150	The noble prize the Gods to Peleus gave.

6150	THE SEVENTH BATTLE, FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.--THE ACTS OF MENELAUS.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy;
6150	Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus
6150	retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This Glaucus
6150	objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had
6150	won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till
6150	Ajax rallies them: AEneas sustains the Trojans. AEneas and Hector
6150	attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The
6150	horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus; Jupiter covers his
6150	body with a thick darkness; the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion.
6150	Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus's
6150	death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the
6150	utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body
6150	to the ships.

6150	BOOK XVII.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Nor was Patroclus' fall, by Trojans slain,
6150	Of warlike Menelaus unobserv'd;
6150	Forward he sprang, in dazzling arms array'd,
6150	And round him mov'd, as round her new-dropp'd calf
6150	Her first, a heifer moves with plaintive moan:
6150	So round Patroclus Menelaus mov'd,
6150	His shield's broad orb and spear before him held,
6150	To all who might oppose him threat'ning death.
6150	Nor, on his side, was Panthous' noble son
6150	Unmindful of the slain; but, standing near,
6150	The warlike Menelaus thus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Illustrious son of Atreus, Heav'n-born chief,"
6150	Quit thou the dead; yield up the bloody spoils:
6150	For, of the Trojans and their fam'd Allies,
6150	Mine was the hand that in the stubborn fight
6150	First struck Patroclus; leave me then to wear
6150	Among the men of Troy my honours due,
6150	"Lest by my spear thou lose thy cherish'd life."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in anger Menelaus thus:
6150	"""O Father Jove, how ill this vaunting tone"
6150	Beseems this braggart! In their own esteem,
6150	"""With Panthous' sons for courage none may vie;"
6150	Nor pard, nor lion, nor the forest boar,
6150	Fiercest of beasts, and proudest of his strength.
6150	Yet nought avail'd to Hyperenor's might
6150	His youthful vigour, when he held me cheap,
6150	And my encounter dar'd; of all the Greeks
6150	He deem'd my prowess least; yet he, I ween,
6150	On his own feet return'd not, to rejoice
6150	His tender wife's and honour'd parents' sight.
6150	So shall thy pride be quell'd, if me thou dare
6150	Encounter; but I warn thee, while 'tis time,
6150	Ere ill betide thee, 'mid the gen'ral throng
6150	That thou withdraw, nor stand to me oppos'd.
6150	"After th' event may e'en a fool be wise."""
6150	He spoke in vain; Euphorbus thus replied:
6150	""
6150	"""Now, Heav'n-born Menelaus, shalt thou pay"
6150	The forfeit for my brother's life, o'er whom,
6150	Slain by thy hand, thou mak'st thy boasting speech.
6150	Thou in the chambers of her new-found home
6150	Hast made his bride a weeping widow; thou
6150	Hast fill'd with bitt'rest grief his parents' hearts:
6150	Some solace might those hapless mourners find,
6150	Could I thy head and armour in the hands
6150	Of Panthous and of honour'd Phrontis place;
6150	Nor uncontested shall the proof remain,
6150	"Nor long deferr'd, of vict'ry or defeat."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and struck the centre of the shield,
6150	But broke not through; against the stubborn brass
6150	The point was bent; then with a pray'r to Jove
6150	The son of Atreus in his turn advanc'd;
6150	And, backward as he stepp'd, below his throat
6150	Took aim, and pressing hard with stalwart hand
6150	Drove through the yielding neck the pond'rous spear:
6150	Thund'ring he fell, and loud his armour rang.
6150	Those locks, that with the Graces' hair might vie,
6150	Those tresses bright, with gold and silver bound,
6150	Were dabbled all with blood. As when a man
6150	Hath rear'd a fair and vig'rous olive plant,
6150	In some lone spot, by copious-gushing springs,
6150	And seen expanding, nurs'd by ev'ry breeze,
6150	Its whit'ning blossoms; till with sudden gust
6150	A sweeping hurricane of wind and rain
6150	Uproots it from its bed, and prostrate lays;
6150	So lay the youthful son of Panthous, slain
6150	By Atreus' son, and of his arms despoil'd.
6150	And as a lion, in the mountains bred,
6150	In pride of strength, amid the pasturing herd
6150	Seizes a heifer in his pow'rful jaws,
6150	The choicest; and, her neck first broken, rends,
6150	And, on her entrails gorging, laps the blood;
6150	Though with loud clamour dogs and herdsmen round
6150	Assail him from afar, yet ventures none
6150	To meet his rage, for fear is on them all;
6150	So none was there so bold, with dauntless breast
6150	The noble Menelaus' wrath to meet.
6150	Now had Atrides borne away with ease
6150	The spoils of Panthous' son; but Phoebus grudg'd
6150	His prize of vict'ry, and against him launch'd
6150	The might of Hector, terrible as Mars:
6150	To whom his winged words, in Mentes' form,
6150	Chief of the Cicones, he thus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, thy labour all is vain, pursuing"
6150	Pelides' flying steeds; and hard are they
6150	For mortal man to harness, or control.
6150	Save for Achilles' self, the Goddess-born.
6150	The valiant Menelaus, Atreus' son,
6150	Defends meanwhile Patroclus; and e'en now
6150	Hath slain a noble Trojan, Panthous' son,
6150	"Euphorbus, and his youthful vigour quell'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and join'd again the strife of men:
6150	Hector's dark soul with bitter grief was fill'd;
6150	He look'd amid the ranks, and saw the two,
6150	One slain, the other stripping off his arms,
6150	The blood outpouring from the gaping wound.
6150	Forward he sprang, in dazzling arms array'd,
6150	Loud shouting, blazing like the quenchless flames
6150	Of Vulcan: Menelaus heard the shout,
6150	And, troubled, commun'd with his valiant heart:
6150	""
6150	"""Oh, woe is me! for should I now the spoils"
6150	Abandon, and Patroclus, who for me
6150	And in my cause lies slain, of any Greek
6150	Who saw me, I might well incur the blame:
6150	And yet if here alone I dare to fight
6150	With Hector and his Trojans, much I fear,
6150	Singly, to be by numbers overwhelm'd;
6150	For Hector all the Trojans hither brings.
6150	But wherefore entertain such thoughts, my soul?
6150	Who strives, against the will divine, with one
6150	Belov'd of Heav'n, a bitter doom must meet.
6150	Then none may blame me, though I should retreat
6150	From Hector, who with Heav'n's assistance wars.
6150	Yet could I hear brave Ajax' battle cry,
6150	We two, returning, would the encounter dare,
6150	E'en against Heav'n, if so for Peleus' son
6150	We might regain, and bear away the dead:
6150	"Some solace of our loss might then be ours."""
6150	""
6150	While in his mind and spirit thus he mus'd,
6150	By Hector led, the Trojan ranks advanc'd:
6150	Backward he mov'd, abandoning the dead;
6150	But turning oft, as when by men and dogs
6150	A bearded lion from the fold is driv'n
6150	With shouts and spears; yet grieves his mighty heart,
6150	And with reluctant step he quits the yard:
6150	So from Patroclus Menelaus mov'd;
6150	Yet when he reach'd his comrades' ranks, he turn'd,
6150	And look'd around, if haply he might find
6150	The mighty Ajax, son of Telamon.
6150	Him on the battle's farthest left he spied,
6150	Cheering his friends and urging to the fight,
6150	For sorely Phoebus had their courage tried;
6150	And hast'ning to his side, address'd him thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Ajax, haste hither; to the rescue come"
6150	Of slain Patroclus; if perchance we two
6150	May to Achilles, Peleus' son, restore
6150	His body: his naked body, for his arms
6150	"Are prize to Hector of the glancing helm."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and Ajax' spirit within him stirr'd;
6150	Forward he sprang, and with him Atreus' son.
6150	Hector was dragging now Patroclus' corpse,
6150	Stripped of its glitt'ring armour, and intent
6150	The head to sever with his sword, and give
6150	The mangled carcase to the dogs of Troy:
6150	But Ajax, with his tow'r-like shield, approach'd;
6150	Then Hector to his comrades' ranks withdrew,
6150	Rush'd to his car, and bade the Trojans bear
6150	The glitt'ring arms, his glorious prize, to Troy:
6150	While Ajax with his mighty shield o'erspread
6150	Menoetius' son; and stood, as for his cubs
6150	A lion stands, whom hunters, unaware,
6150	Have with his offspring met amid the woods.
6150	Proud in his strength he stands; and down are drawn,
6150	Cov'ring his eyes, the wrinkles of his brow:
6150	So o'er Patroclus mighty Ajax stood,
6150	And by his side, his heart with grief oppress'd,
6150	The warlike Menelaus, Atreus' son.
6150	""
6150	Then Glaucus, leader of the Lycian host,
6150	To Hector thus, with scornful glance, address'd
6150	"His keen reproaches: ""Hector, fair of form,"
6150	How art thou wanting in the fight! thy fame,
6150	Coward and runaway, thou hast belied.
6150	Bethink thee now, if thou alone canst save
6150	The city, aided but by Trojans born;
6150	Henceforth no Lycian will go forth for Troy
6150	To fight with Greeks; since favour none we gain
6150	By unremitting toil against the foe.
6150	How can a meaner man expect thine aid,
6150	Who basely to the Greeks a prize and spoil
6150	Sarpedon leav'st, thy comrade and thy guest?
6150	Greatly he serv'd the city and thyself,
6150	While yet he liv'd; and now thou dar'st not save
6150	His body from the dogs! By my advice
6150	If Lycians will be rul'd, we take at once
6150	Our homeward way, and Troy may meet her doom.
6150	But if in Trojan bosoms there abode
6150	The daring, dauntless courage, meet for men
6150	Who in their country's cause against the foe
6150	Endure both toil and war, we soon should see
6150	Patroclus brought within the walls of Troy;
6150	Him from the battle could we bear away,
6150	And, lifeless, bring to royal Priam's town,
6150	Soon would the Greeks Sarpedon's arms release,
6150	And we to Ilium's heights himself might bear:
6150	For with his valiant comrades there lies slain
6150	The follower of the bravest chief of Greece.
6150	But thou before the mighty Ajax stood'st
6150	With downcast eyes, nor durst in manly fight
6150	"Contend with one thy better far confess'd."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm,
6150	"With stern regard, replied: ""Why, Glaucus, speak,"
6150	Brave as thou art, in this o'erbearing strain?
6150	Good friend, I heretofore have held thee wise
6150	O'er all who dwell in Lycia's fertile soil;
6150	But now I change, and hold thy judgment cheap,
6150	Who chargest me with flying from the might
6150	Of giant Ajax; never have I shrunk
6150	From the stern fight, and clatter of the cars;
6150	But all o'erruling is the mind of Jove,
6150	Who strikes with panic, and of vict'ry robs
6150	The bravest; and anon excites to war.
6150	Stand by me now, and see if through the day
6150	I prove myself the coward that thou say'st,
6150	Or suffer that a Greek, how brave soe'er,
6150	"Shall rescue from my hands Patroclus' corpse."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and loudly on the Trojans call'd:
6150	"""Trojans and Lycians, and ye Dardans, fam'd"
6150	In close encounter, quit ye now like men;
6150	Maintain awhile the stubborn fight, while I
6150	The splendid armour of Achilles don,
6150	"My glorious prize from slain Patroclus torn."""
6150	""
6150	So saying, Hector of the glancing helm,
6150	Withdrawing from the field, with rapid steps
6150	His comrades follow'd, and ere long o'ertook,
6150	Who tow'rd the town Achilles' armour bore;
6150	Then standing from the bloody fight aloof
6150	The armour he exchang'd; his own he bade
6150	The warlike Trojans to the city bear;
6150	While he, of Peleus' son, Achilles, donn'd
6150	The heav'nly armour, which th' immortal Gods
6150	Gave to his sire; he to his son convey'd;
6150	Yet in that armour grew not old that son.
6150	""
6150	Him when apart the Cloud-compeller saw
6150	Girt with the arms of Peleus' godlike son,
6150	He shook his head, and inly thus he mus'd:
6150	"""Ah hapless! little deem'st thou of thy fate,"
6150	Though now so nigh! Thou of the prime of men,
6150	The dread of all, hast donn'd th' immortal arms,
6150	Whose comrade, brave and good, thy hand hath slain;
6150	And sham'd him, stripping from his head and breast
6150	Helmet and cuirass; yet thy latest hours
6150	Will I with glory crown; since ne'er from thee,
6150	Eeturn'd from battle, shall Andromache
6150	"Receive the spoils of Peleus' godlike son."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and nodded with his shadowy brows;
6150	Then with the armour, fitted to his form
6150	By Jove himself, was Hector girt by Mars
6150	The fierce and terrible; with vig'rous strength
6150	His limbs were strung, as 'mid his brave allies
6150	He sprang, loud-shouting; glitt'ring in his arms,
6150	To all he seem'd Achilles' godlike self.
6150	To each and all in cheering tones he spoke,
6150	Mesthles and Glaucus and Thersilochus,
6150	Asteropaeus and Hippothous,
6150	Medon, Deisenor, Phoreys, Chromius,
6150	And Ennomus the seer: to all of these
6150	His winged words he cheeringly address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Hear me, ye countless tribes, that dwelling round"
6150	Assist our cause! You from your sev'ral homes
6150	Not for display of numbers have I call'd,
6150	But that with willing hearts ye should defend
6150	Our wives and infants from the warlike Greeks:
6150	For this I drain my people's stores, for food
6150	And gifts for you, exalting your estate;
6150	Then, who will boldly onward, he may fall,
6150	Or safe escape, such is the chance of war;
6150	But who within our valiant Trojans' ranks
6150	Shall but the body of Patroclus bring,
6150	Despite the might of Ajax; half the spoils
6150	To him I give, the other half myself
6150	"Retaining; and his praise shall equal mine."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and onward, with uplifted spears,
6150	They march'd upon the Greeks; high rose their hopes
6150	From Ajax Telamon to snatch the dead;
6150	Vain hopes, which cost them many a life! Then thus
6150	To valiant Menelaus Ajax spoke;
6150	""
6150	"""O Heav'n-born Menelaus, noble friend,"
6150	For safe return I dare no longer hope:
6150	Not for Patroclus' corpse so much I fear,
6150	Which soon will glut the dogs and birds of Troy,
6150	As for my life and thine I tremble now:
6150	For, like a war-cloud, Hector's might I see
6150	O'ershadowing all around; now is our doom
6150	Apparent; but do thou for succour call
6150	"On all the chiefs, if haply they may hear."""
6150	Thus Ajax spoke: obedient to his word,
6150	On all the chiefs Atrides call'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
6150	All ye that banquet at the gen'ral cost
6150	With Atreus' sons, and o'er your sev'ral states
6150	Dominion hold; whose honour is of Jove;
6150	'Twere hard to call by name each single man,
6150	So fierce the combat rages; but let each
6150	And all their aid afford, and deem, it shame
6150	"Patroclus' corpse should glut the dogs of Troy."""
6150	""
6150	He said: first heard Oileus' active son,
6150	And hast'ning through the fray, beside him stood.
6150	Next him Idomeneus, with whom there came,
6150	Valiant as Mars, his friend Meriones.
6150	But who can know or tell the names of all,
6150	Who, following, swell'd the battle of the Greeks?
6150	Onward the Trojans press'd, by Hector led:
6150	With such a sound, as when the ocean wave
6150	Meets on the beach th' outpouring of a stream,
6150	Swoll'n by the rains of Heav'n: the lofty cliffs
6150	Resound, and bellows the big sea without;
6150	With such a sound advanc'd the Trojan host:
6150	While round Patroclus, with one heart and mind,
6150	The Greeks a fence of brass-clad bucklers rais'd.
6150	O'er their bright helms the son of Saturn shed
6150	A veil of darkness; for Menoetius' son,
6150	Achilles' faithful friend, while yet he liv'd
6150	Jove hated not, nor would that now his corpse
6150	Should to the dogs of Troy remain a prey,
6150	But to the rescue all his comrades stirr'd.
6150	At first the Trojans drove the keen-ey'd Greeks;
6150	Leaving the corpse, they fled; nor with their spears
6150	The valiant Trojans reach'd a single Greek;
6150	But on the dead they seiz'd; yet not for long
6150	Endur'd their flight; them Ajax rallied soon,
6150	In form pre-eminent, and deeds of arms,
6150	O'er all the Greeks, save Peleus' matchless son.
6150	Onward he sprang, as springs a mountain boar,
6150	Which, turning in the forest glade to bay,
6150	Scatters with ease both dogs and stalwart youths;
6150	So Ajax scatter'd soon the Trojan ranks,
6150	That round Patroclus closing, hop'd to bear,
6150	With glory to themselves, his corpse to Troy.
6150	Hippothous, Pelasgian Lethus' son,
6150	Was dragging by the feet the noble dead,
6150	A leathern belt around his ancles bound,
6150	Seeking the favour of the men of Troy;
6150	But on himself he brought destruction down,
6150	Which none might turn aside; for from the crowd
6150	Outsprang the son of Telamon, and struck,
6150	In close encounter, on the brass-cheek'd helm;
6150	The plumed helm was shiver'd by the blow,
6150	Dealt by a weighty spear and stalwart hand;
6150	Gush'd from the wound the mingled blood and brain,
6150	His vital spirit quench'd; and on the ground
6150	Fell from his pow'rless grasp Patroclus' foot;
6150	While he himself lay stretch'd beside the dead,
6150	Far from his own Larissa's teeming soil:
6150	Not destin'd he his parents to repay
6150	Their early care; for short his term of life,
6150	By godlike Ajax' mighty spear subdu'd.
6150	""
6150	At Ajax Hector threw his glitt'ring spear:
6150	He saw, and narrowly the brazen death
6150	Escap'd; but Schedius, son of Iphitus,
6150	(The bravest of the Phocian chiefs, who dwelt
6150	In far-fam'd Panopeus, the mighty Lord
6150	Of num'rous hosts,) below the collar-bone
6150	It struck, and passing through, the brazen point
6150	Came forth again beneath his shoulder-blade:
6150	Thund'ring he fell, and loud his armour rang.
6150	""
6150	As Phorcys, son of Phaenops, kept his watch
6150	O'er slain Hippothous, him Ajax smote
6150	Below the waist; the weighty spear broke through
6150	The hollow breastplate, and th' intestines tore;
6150	Prone in the dust he fell, and clutch'd the ground.
6150	At this the Trojan chiefs and Hector's self
6150	'Gan to give way; the Greeks, with joyful shouts,
6150	Seiz'd both the dead, and stripp'd their armour off.
6150	To Ilium now, before the warlike Greeks,
6150	O'ercome by panic, had the Trojans fled;
6150	And now had Greeks, despite the will of Jove,
6150	By their own strength and courage, won the day,
6150	Had not Apollo's self AEneas rous'd,
6150	In likeness of a herald, Periphas,
6150	The son of Epytus, now aged grown
6150	In service of AEneas' aged sire,
6150	A man of kindliest soul: his form assum'd
6150	Apollo, and AEneas thus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""AEneas, how, against the will of Heav'n,"
6150	Could ye defend your city, as others now
6150	In their own strength and courage confident,
6150	Their numbers, and their troops' undaunted hearts,
6150	I see their cause maintaining; if when Jove
6150	Rather to us than them the vict'ry wills,
6150	"With fear unspeakable ye shun the fight?"""
6150	""
6150	He said: the presence of the Archer-God
6150	AEneas knew, and loud to Hector call'd:
6150	"""Hector, and all ye other chiefs of Troy,"
6150	And brave Allies, foul shame it were that we,
6150	O'ercome by panic, should to Ilium now
6150	In flight be driv'n before the warlike Greeks;
6150	And by my side, but now, some God there stood,
6150	And told how Jove, the sov'reign arbiter
6150	Of battle, on our side bestow'd his aid;
6150	On then! nor undisturbed allow the Greeks
6150	"To bear Patroclus' body to their ships."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and far before the ranks advanc'd;
6150	They rallying turn'd, and fac'd again the Greeks.
6150	Then first AEneas' spear the comrade brave
6150	Of Lycomedes struck, Laocritus,
6150	Son of Arisbas; Lycomedes saw
6150	With pitying eyes his gallant comrade's fall;
6150	And standing near, his glitt'ring spear he threw,
6150	And through the midriff Apisaon struck,
6150	His people's guardian chief, the valiant son
6150	Of Hippasus, and slack'd his limbs in death.
6150	He from Paeonia's fertile fields had come,
6150	O'er all his comrades eminent in fight,
6150	All save Asteropaeus, who with eyes
6150	Of pity saw his gallant comrade's fall,
6150	And forward sprang to battle with the Greeks;
6150	Yet could not force his way; for all around
6150	Patroclus rose a fence of serried shields,
6150	And spears projecting: such the orders giv'n
6150	By Ajax, and with earnest care enforc'd;
6150	That from around the dead should none retire,
6150	Nor any to the front advance alone
6150	Before his fellows; but their steady guard
6150	Maintain, and hand to hand the battle wage.
6150	So order'd Ajax; then with crimson blood
6150	The earth was wet; and hand to hand they fell,
6150	Trojans alike, and brave Allies, and Greeks;
6150	For neither these a bloodless fight sustain'd,
6150	Though fewer far their losses; for they stood
6150	Of mutual succour mindful, and support.
6150	Thus, furious as the rage of fire, they fought;
6150	Nor might ye deem the glorious sun himself
6150	Nor moon was safe; for darkest clouds of night
6150	O'erspread the warriors, who the battle wag'd
6150	Around the body of Menoetius' son:
6150	Elsewhere the Trojans and the well-greav'd Greeks
6150	Fought, undisturb'd, in the clear light of day;
6150	The sun's bright beams were shed abroad; no cloud
6150	Lay on the face of earth or mountain tops;
6150	They but by fits, at distant intervals,
6150	And far apart, each seeking to avoid
6150	The hostile missiles, fought; but in the midst
6150	The bravest all, in darkness and in strife
6150	Sore press'd, toil'd on beneath their armour's weight.
6150	""
6150	As yet no tidings of Patroclus' fall
6150	Had reach'd two valiant chiefs, Antilochus
6150	And Thrasymedes; but they deem'd him still
6150	Alive, and fighting in the foremost ranks.
6150	They, witnessing their comrades' flight and death,
6150	Fought on apart, by Nestor so enjoin'd,
6150	When from the ships he bade them join the fray.
6150	Great was meanwhile their labour, who sustain'd,
6150	Throughout the livelong day, that weary fight;
6150	Reek'd with continuous toil and sweat, the knees,
6150	And legs and feet, the arms, and eyes, of all
6150	Who round Achilles' faithful comrade fought.
6150	As when a chief his people bids to stretch
6150	A huge bull's hide, all drench'd and soak'd with grease;
6150	They in a circle rang'd, this way and that,
6150	Pull the tough hide, till ent'ring in, the grease
6150	Is all absorb'd; and dragg'd by num'rous hands
6150	The supple skin to th' utmost length is stretch'd;
6150	So these in narrow space this way and that
6150	The body dragg'd; and high the hopes of each
6150	To bear it off in triumph; to their ships
6150	The Greeks, to Troy the Trojans; fiercely rag'd
6150	The struggle; spirit-stirring Mars himself,
6150	Or Pallas to her utmost fury rous'd,
6150	Had not that struggle with contempt beheld:
6150	Such grievous labour o'er Patroclus' corpse
6150	Had Jove to horses and to men decreed.
6150	""
6150	But of Patroclus' fall no tidings yet
6150	Had reach'd Achilles; for the war was wag'd
6150	Far from the ships, beneath the walls of Troy;
6150	Nor look'd he of his death to hear, but deem'd
6150	That when the Trojans to their gates were driv'n,
6150	He would return in safety; for no hope
6150	Had he of taking by assault the town,
6150	With, or without, his aid; for oft apart
6150	His Goddess-mother had his doom, foretold,
6150	Revealing to her son the mind of Jove;
6150	Yet ne'er had warn'd him of such grief as this,
6150	Which now befell, his dearest comrade's loss.
6150	""
6150	Still round the dead they held their pointed spears,
6150	Fought hand to hand, and mutual slaughter dealt;
6150	And thus perchance some brass-clad Greek would say:
6150	""
6150	"""O friends, 'twere shameful should we to the ships"
6150	Ingloriously return; ere that should be,
6150	Let earth engulph us all; so better far
6150	Than let these Trojans to their city bear
6150	"Our dead, and boast them of their triumph gain'd."""
6150	On th' other hand some valiant Trojan thus
6150	"Would shout: ""O friends, tho' fate decreed that here"
6150	"We all should die, yet let not one give way."""
6150	""
6150	Thus, cheering each his comrades, would they speak,
6150	And thus they fought; the iron clangour pierc'd
6150	The empty air, and brazen vault of Heav'n.
6150	But, from the fight withdrawn, Achilles' steeds
6150	Wept, as they heard how in the dust was laid
6150	Their charioteer, by Hector's murd'rous hand.
6150	Automedon, Diores' valiant son,
6150	Essay'd in vain to rouse them with the lash,
6150	In vain with honey'd words, in vain with threats;
6150	Nor to the ships would they return again
6150	By the broad Hellespont, nor join the fray;
6150	But as a column stands, which marks the tomb
6150	Of man or woman, so immovable
6150	Beneath the splendid car they stood, their heads
6150	Down-drooping to the ground, while scalding tears
6150	Dropp'd earthward from their eyelids, as they mourn'd
6150	Their charioteer; and o'er the yoke-band shed
6150	Down stream'd their ample manes, with dust defil'd.
6150	The son of Saturn pitying saw their grief,
6150	And sorrowing shook his head, as thus he mus'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Ah, hapless horses! wherefore gave we you"
6150	To royal Peleus, to a mortal man,
6150	You that from age and death are both exempt!
6150	Was it that you the miseries might share
6150	Of wretched mortals? for of all that breathe,
6150	And walk upon the earth, or creep, is nought
6150	More wretched than th' unhappy race of man.
6150	Yet shall not ye, nor shall your well-wrought car,
6150	By Hector, son of Priam, be controll'd;
6150	I will not suffer it; enough for him
6150	To hold, with vaunting boast, Achilles' arms;
6150	But to your limbs and spirits will I impart
6150	Such strength, that from the battle to the ships
6150	Ye shall in safety bear Automedon;
6150	For yet I will the Trojans shall prevail,
6150	And slay, until they reach the well-mann'd ships,
6150	"Till sets the sun, and darkness shrouds the earth."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and in their breasts fresh spirit infus'd;
6150	They, shaking from their manes the dust, the car
6150	Amid the Greeks and Trojans lightly bore.
6150	Then, as a vulture 'mid a flock of geese,
6150	Amid the battle rush'd Automedon,
6150	His horses' course directing, and their speed
6150	Exciting, though he mourn'd his comrade slain.
6150	Swiftly he fled from out the Trojan host;
6150	Swiftly again assail'd them in pursuit;
6150	Yet, speedy to pursue, he could not slay;
6150	Nor, in the car alone, had pow'r at once
6150	To guide the flying steeds, and hurl the spear.
6150	At length a comrade brave, Alcimedon,
6150	Laerces' son, beheld; behind the car
6150	He stood, and thus Automedon address'd:
6150	"""Automedon, what God has fill'd thy mind"
6150	With counsels vain, and thee of sense bereft?
6150	That with the Trojans, in the foremost ranks,
6150	Thou fain wouldst fight alone, thy comrade slain,
6150	While Hector proudly on his breast displays
6150	"The glorious arms of great AEacides."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Automedon, Diores' son:
6150	"""Alcimedon, since none of all the Greeks"
6150	May vie with thee, the mettle to control
6150	Of these immortal horses, save indeed,
6150	While yet he liv'd, Patroclus, godlike chief;
6150	But him stern death and fate have overta'en;
6150	Take thon the whip and shining reins, while I,
6150	"Descending from the car, engage in fight."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and, mounting on the war-car straight,
6150	Alcimedon the whip and reins assum'd;
6150	Down leap'd Automedon; great Hector saw,
6150	And thus address'd AEneas at his side:
6150	""
6150	"""AEneas, prince and counsellor of Troy,"
6150	I see, committed to unskilful hands,
6150	Achilles' horses on the battle-field:
6150	These we may hope to take, if such thy will;
6150	For they, methinks, will scarcely stand oppos'd,
6150	"Or dare th' encounter of our joint assault."""
6150	""
6150	He said; Anchises' valiant son complied;
6150	Forward they went, their shoulders cover'd o'er
6150	With stout bull's-hide, thick overlaid with brass.
6150	With them both Chromius and Aretus went;
6150	""
6150	And high their hopes were rais'd, the warriors both
6150	To slay, and make the strong-neck'd steeds their prize:
6150	Blind fools! nor destin'd scatheless to escape
6150	Automedon's encounter; he his pray'r
6150	To Jove address'd, and straight with added strength
6150	His soul was fill'd; and to Alcimedon,
6150	His trusty friend and comrade, thus he spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Alcimedon, do thou the horses keep"
6150	Not far away, but breathing on my neck;
6150	For Hector's might will not, I deem, be stay'd,
6150	Ere us he slay, and mount Achilles' car,
6150	And carry terror 'mid the Grecian host,
6150	"Or in the foremost ranks himself be slain."""
6150	""
6150	Thus spoke Automedon, and loudly call'd
6150	On Menelaus and th' Ajaces both:
6150	"""Ye two Ajaces, leaders of the host,"
6150	And, Menelaus, with our bravest all,
6150	Ye on the dead alone your care bestow,
6150	To guard him, and stave off the hostile ranks;
6150	But haste, and us, the living, save from death;
6150	For Hector and AEneas hitherward,
6150	With weight o'erpow'ring, through the bloody press,
6150	The bravest of the Trojans, force their way:
6150	Yet is the issue in the hands of Heav'n;
6150	"I hurl the spear, but Jove directs the blow."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and, poising, hurl'd the pond'rous spear;
6150	Full on Aretus' broad-orb'd shield it struck;
6150	Nor stay'd the shield its course; the brazen point
6150	Drove through the belt, and in his body lodg'd.
6150	As with sharp axe in hand a stalwart man,
6150	Striking behind the horns a sturdy bull,
6150	Severs the neck; he, forward, plunging, falls;
6150	So forward first he sprang, then backwards fell:
6150	And quiv'ring, in his vitals deep infix'd,
6150	The sharp spear soon relax'd his limbs in death.
6150	Then at Automedon great Hector threw
6150	His glitt'ring spear; he saw, and forward stoop'd,
6150	And shunn'd the brazen death; behind him far
6150	Deep in the soil infix'd, with quiv'ring shaft
6150	The weapon stood; there Mars its impulse stay'd.
6150	And now with swords, and hand to hand, the fight
6150	Had been renew'd; but at their comrade's call
6150	The two Ajaces, pressing through the throng,
6150	Between the warriors interpos'd in haste.
6150	Before them Hector and AEneas both,
6150	And godlike Chromius, in alarm recoil'd;
6150	Pierc'd through the heart, Aretus there they left;
6150	And, terrible as Mars, Automedon
6150	Stripp'd off his arms, and thus exulting cried:
6150	"""Of some small portion of its load of grief,"
6150	For slain Patroclus, is my heart reliev'd,
6150	"In slaying thee, all worthless as thou art."""
6150	""
6150	Then, throwing on the car the bloody spoils,
6150	He mounted, hands and feet imbrued with blood,
6150	As 'twere a lion, fresh from his repast
6150	Upon the carcase of a slaughter'd bull.
6150	""
6150	Again around Patroclus' body rag'd
6150	The stubborn conflict, direful, sorrow-fraught:
6150	From Heav'n descending, Pallas stirr'd the strife,
6150	Sent by all-seeing Jove to stimulate
6150	The warlike Greeks; so changed was now his will.
6150	As o'er the face of Heav'n when Jove extends
6150	His bright-hued bow, a sign to mortal men
6150	Of war, or wintry storms, which bid surcease
6150	The rural works of man, and pinch the flocks;
6150	So Pallas, in a bright-hued cloud array'd,
6150	Pass'd through the ranks, and rous'd each sev'ral man.
6150	To noble Menelaus, Atreus' son,
6150	Who close beside her stood, the Goddess first,
6150	The form of Phoenix and his pow'rful voice
6150	Assuming, thus her stirring words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""On thee, O Menelaus, foul reproach"
6150	Will fasten, if Achilles' faithful friend
6150	The dogs devour beneath the walls of Troy;
6150	"Then hold thou firm, and all the host inspire."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Menelaus, good in fight:
6150	"""O Phoenix, aged warrior, honour'd sire,"
6150	If Pallas would the needful pow'r impart,
6150	And o'er me spread her aegis, then would I
6150	Undaunted for Patroclus' rescue fight,
6150	For deeply by his death my heart is touch'd;
6150	But valiant Hector, with the strength of fire
6150	Still rages, and destruction deals around:
6150	"For Jove is with him, and his triumph wills."""
6150	""
6150	He said: the blue-ey'd Goddess heard with joy
6150	That, chief of all the Gods, her aid he sought.
6150	She gave fresh vigour to his arms and knees,
6150	And to his breast the boldness of the fly,
6150	Which, oft repell'd by man, renews th' assault
6150	Incessant, lur'd by taste of human blood;
6150	Such boldness in Atrides' manly breast
6150	Pallas inspir'd: beside Patroclus' corpse
6150	Again he stood, and pois'd his glitt'ring spear.
6150	""
6150	There was one Podes in the Trojan ranks,
6150	Son of Eetion, rich, of blameless life,
6150	Of all the people most to Hector dear,
6150	And at his table oft a welcome guest:
6150	Him, as he turn'd to fly, beneath the waist
6150	Atrides struck; right through the spear was driv'n;
6150	Thund'ring he fell; and Atreus' son the corpse
6150	Dragg'd from the Trojans 'mid the ranks of Greece.
6150	""
6150	Then close at Hector's side Apollo stood,
6150	Clad in the form of Phaenops, Asius' son,
6150	Who in Abydos dwelt; of all th' Allies
6150	Honour'd of Hector most, and best belov'd;
6150	Clad in his form, the Far-destroyer spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, what other Greek will scare thee next?"
6150	Who shrink'st from Menelaus, heretofore
6150	A warrior deem'd of no repute; but now,
6150	Alone, he robs our Trojans of their dead;
6150	And in the foremost ranks e'en now hath slain
6150	"Podes, thine own good friend, Eetion's son."""
6150	""
6150	He said; dark grief o'erclouded Hector's brow,
6150	As to the front in dazzling arms he sprang.
6150	Then Saturn's son his tassell'd aegis wav'd,
6150	All glitt'ring bright; and Ida's lofty head
6150	In clouds and darkness shrouded; then he bade
6150	His lightning flash, his volleying thunder roar,
6150	That shook the mountain; and with vict'ry crown'd
6150	The Trojan arms, and panic-struck the Greeks.
6150	""
6150	The first who turn'd to fly was Peneleus,
6150	Boeotian chief; him, facing still the foe,
6150	A spear had slightly on the shoulder struck,
6150	The bone just grazing: by Polydamas,
6150	Who close before him stood, the spear was thrown.
6150	Then Hector Leitus, Aloctryon's son,
6150	Thrust thro' the wrist, and quell'd his warlike might;
6150	Trembling, he look'd around, nor hop'd again
6150	The Trojans, spear in hand, to meet in fight;
6150	But, onward as he rush'd on Leitus,
6150	Idomeneus at Hector threw his spear:
6150	Full on his breast it struck; but near the head
6150	The sturdy shaft was on the breastplate snapp'd:
6150	Loud was the Trojans' shout; and he in turn
6150	Aim'd at Idomeneus, Deucalion's son,
6150	Upstanding on his car; his mark he miss'd,
6150	But Coeranus he struck, the charioteer
6150	And faithful follower of Meriones,
6150	Who with him came from Lyctus' thriving town:
6150	The chief had left on foot the well-trimm'd ships;
6150	And, had not Coeranus his car in haste
6150	Driv'n to the rescue, by his fall had giv'n
6150	A Trojan triumph; to his Lord he brought
6150	Safety, and rescue from unsparing death;
6150	But fell, himself, by Hector's murd'rous hand.
6150	Him Hector struck between the cheek and ear,
6150	Crashing the teeth, and cutting through the tongue.
6150	Headlong he fell to earth, and dropp'd the reins:
6150	These, stooping from the car, Meriones
6150	Caught up, and thus Idomeneus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Ply now the lash, until thou reach the ships:"
6150	"Thyself must see how crush'd the strength of Greece."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and tow'rd the ships Idomeneus
6150	Urg'd his fleet steeds; for fear was on his soul.
6150	Nor did not Ajax and Atrides see
6150	How in the Trojans' favour Saturn's son
6150	The wav'ring scale of vict'ry turn'd; and thus
6150	Great Ajax Telamon his grief express'd:
6150	""
6150	"""O Heav'n! the veriest child might plainly see"
6150	That Jove the Trojans' triumph has decreed:
6150	Their weapons all, by whomsoever thrown,
6150	Or weak, or strong, attain their mark; for Jove
6150	Directs their course; while ours upon the plain
6150	Innocuous fall. But take we counsel now
6150	How from the fray to bear away our dead,
6150	And by our own return rejoice those friends
6150	Who look with sorrow on our plight, and deem
6150	That we, all pow'rless to resist the might
6150	Of Hector's arm, beside the ships must fall.
6150	Would that some comrade were at hand, to bear
6150	A message to Achilles; him, I ween,
6150	As yet the mournful tidings have not reach'd,
6150	That on the field his dearest friend lies dead.
6150	But such I see not; for a veil of cloud
6150	O'er men and horses all around is spread.
6150	O Father Jove, from, o'er the sons of Greece
6150	Remove this cloudy darkness; clear the sky,
6150	That we may see our fate, and die at least,
6150	"If such thy will, in th' open light of day."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and, pitying, Jove beheld his tears;
6150	The clouds he scatter'd, and the mist dispers'd;
6150	The sun shone forth, and all the field was clear;
6150	Then Ajax thus to Menelaus spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Now, Heav'n-born Menelaus, look around"
6150	If haply 'mid the living thou mayst see
6150	Antilochus, the noble Nester's son;
6150	And bid him to Achilles bear in haste
6150	"The tidings, that his dearest friend lies dead."""
6150	""
6150	He said, nor did Atrides not comply;
6150	But slow as moves a lion from the fold,
6150	Which dogs and youths with ceaseless toil hath worn,
6150	Who all night long have kept their watch, to guard
6150	From his assault the choicest of the herd;
6150	He, hunger-pinch'd, hath oft th' attempt renew'd,
6150	But nought prevail'd; by spears on ev'ry side,
6150	And jav'lins met, wielded by stalwart hands,
6150	And blazing torches, which his courage daunt;
6150	Till with the morn he sullenly withdraws;
6150	So from Patroclus, with reluctant step
6150	Atrides mov'd; for much he fear'd the Greeks
6150	Might to the Trojans, panic-struck, the dead
6150	Abandon; and departing, he besought
6150	The two Ajaces and Meriones:
6150	"""Ye two Ajaces, leaders of the Greeks,"
6150	And thou, Meriones, remember now
6150	Our lost Patroclus' gentle courtesy,
6150	How kind and genial was his soul to all,
6150	"While yet he liv'd--now sunk, alas! in death."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, Menelaus took his way,
6150	Casting his glance around on ev'ry side,
6150	Like to an eagle, fam'd of sharpest sight
6150	Of all that fly beneath the vault of Heav'n;
6150	Whom, soaring in the clouds, the crouching hare
6150	Eludes not, though in leafiest covert hid;
6150	But swooping down, he rends her life away:
6150	So, Menelaus, through the ranks of war
6150	Thy piercing glances ev'ry way were turn'd,
6150	If Nestor's son, alive, thou mightst descry;
6150	Him on the field's extremest left he found,
6150	Cheering his friends, and urging to the fight;
6150	He stood beside him, and address'd him thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Antilochus, come hither, godlike friend,"
6150	And woful tidings hear, which would to Heav'n
6150	I had not to impart; thyself thou seest
6150	How Jove hath heap'd disaster on the Greeks,
6150	And vict'ry giv'n to Troy; but one has fallen,
6150	Our bravest, best! Patroclus lies in death;
6150	And deeply must the Greeks his loss deplore.
6150	But haste thee to the ships, to Peleus' son
6150	The tidings bear, if haply he may save
6150	The body of Patroclus from the foe;
6150	His naked body, for his arms are now
6150	"The prize of Hector of the glancing helm."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and at his words Antilochus
6150	Astounded stood; long time his tongue in vain
6150	For utt'rance strove; his eyes were fill'd with tears,
6150	His cheerful voice was mute; yet not the less
6150	To Menelaus' bidding gave his care:
6150	Swiftly he sped; but to Laodocus,
6150	His comrade brave, who waited with his car
6150	In close attendance, first consign'd his arms;
6150	Then from the field with active limbs he flew,
6150	Weeping, with mournful news, to Peleus' son.
6150	Nor, noble Menelaus, did thy heart
6150	Incline thee to remain, and aid thy friends,
6150	Where from their war-worn ranks the Pylian troops
6150	Deplor'd the absence of Antilochus;
6150	But these in godlike Thrasymedes' charge
6150	He left; and to Patroclus hast'ning back,
6150	Beside th' Ajaces stood, as thus he spoke:
6150	"""Him to Achilles, to the ships, in haste"
6150	I have despatch'd; yet fiercely as his wrath
6150	May burn tow'rd Hector, I can scarce expect
6150	His presence here; for how could he, unarm'd,
6150	With Trojans fight? But take we counsel now
6150	How from the field to bear away our dead,
6150	"And 'scape ourselves from death by Trojan hands."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus great Ajax Telamon:
6150	"""Illustrious Menelaus, all thy words"
6150	Are just and true; then from amid the press,
6150	Thou and Meriones, take up in haste,
6150	And bear away the body; while behind
6150	We two, in heart united, as in name,
6150	Who side by side have still been wont to fight,
6150	"Will Hector and his Trojans hold at bay."""
6150	""
6150	He said; they, lifting in their arms the corpse,
6150	Uprais'd it high in air; then from behind
6150	Loud yell'd the Trojans, as they saw the Greeks
6150	Retiring with their dead; and on they rush'd,
6150	As dogs that in advance of hunter youths
6150	Pursue a wounded boar; awhile they run,
6150	Eager for blood; but when, in pride of strength,
6150	He turns upon them, backward they recoil,
6150	This way and that in fear of death dispers'd:
6150	So onward press'd awhile the Trojan crowd,
6150	With thrust of swords, and double-pointed spears;
6150	But ever as th' Ajaces turn'd to bay,
6150	Their colour chang'd to pale, not one so bold
6150	As, dashing on, to battle for the corpse.
6150	Thus they, with anxious care, from off the field
6150	Bore tow'rd the ships their dead; but on their track
6150	Came sweeping on the storm of battle, fierce,
6150	As, on a sudden breaking forth, the fire
6150	Seizes some populous city, and devours
6150	House after house amid the glare and blaze,
6150	While roar the flames before the gusty wind;
6150	So fiercely pressed upon the Greeks' retreat
6150	The clatt'ring tramp of steeds and armed men.
6150	But as the mules, with stubborn strength endued,
6150	That down the mountain through the trackless waste
6150	Drag some huge log, or timber for the ships;
6150	And spent with toil and sweat, still labour on
6150	Unflinching; so the Greeks with patient toil
6150	Bore on their dead; th' Ajaces in their rear
6150	Stemming the war, as stems the torrent's force
6150	Some wooded cliff, far stretching o'er the plain;
6150	Checking the mighty river's rushing stream,
6150	And flinging it aside upon the plain,
6150	Itself unbroken by the strength of flood:
6150	So firmly, in the rear, th' Ajaces stemm'd
6150	The Trojan force; yet these still onward press'd,
6150	And, 'mid their comrades proudly eminent,
6150	Two chiefs, AEneas, old Anchises' son,
6150	And glorious Hector, in the van were seen.
6150	Then, as a cloud of starlings or of daws
6150	Fly screaming, as they see the hawk approach,
6150	To lesser birds the messenger of death;
6150	So before Hector and AEneas fled,
6150	Screaming, forgetful of their warlike fame,
6150	The sons of Greece; and scatter'd here and there
6150	Around the ditch lay store of goodly arms,
6150	By Greeks abandon'd in their hasty flight.
6150	Yet still, unintermitted, rag'd the war.

6150	Swift-footed messenger, his tidings bore.
6150	Him by the high-beak'd ships he found, his mind
6150	Th' event presaging, fill'd with anxious thoughts,
6150	As thus he commun'd with his mighty heart:
6150	""
6150	"""Alas! what means it, that the long-hair'd Greeks,"
6150	Chas'd from the plain, are thronging round the ships?
6150	Let me not now, ye Gods, endure the grief
6150	My mother once foretold, that I should live
6150	To see the bravest of the Myrmidons
6150	Cut off by Trojans from the light of day.
6150	Menoetius' noble son has surely fall'n;
6150	Foolhardy! yet I warn'd him, and besought,
6150	Soon as the ships from hostile fires were safe,
6150	"Back to return, nor Hector's onset meet."""
6150	""
6150	While in his mind and spirit thus he mus'd,
6150	Beside him stood the noble Nestor's son,
6150	And weeping, thus his mournful message gave:
6150	""
6150	"""Alas! great son of Peleus, woful news,"
6150	Which would to Heav'n I had not to impart,
6150	To thee I bring; Patroclus lies in death;
6150	And o'er his body now the war is wag'd;
6150	His naked body, for his arms are now
6150	"The prize of Hector of the glancing helm."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and darkest clouds of grief o'erspread
6150	Achilles' brow; with both his hands he seiz'd
6150	And pour'd upon his head the grimy dust,
6150	Marring his graceful visage; and defil'd
6150	With black'ning ashes all his costly robes.
6150	Stretch'd in the dust his lofty stature lay,
6150	As with his hands his flowing locks he tore;
6150	Loud was the wailing of the female band,
6150	Achilles' and Patroclus' prize of war,
6150	As round Achilles, rushing out of doors,
6150	Beating their breasts, with tott'ring limbs they press'd.
6150	In tears beside him stood Antilochus,
6150	And in his own Achilles' hand he held,
6150	Groaning in spirit, fearful lest for grief
6150	In his own bosom he should sheathe his sword.
6150	Loud were his moans; his Goddess-mother heard,
6150	Beside her aged father where she sat
6150	In the deep ocean caves; she heard, and wept:
6150	The Nereids all, in ocean's depths who dwell,
6150	Encircled her around; Cymodoce,                                 [5]
6150	Nesaee, Spio, and Cymothoe,
6150	The stag-ey'd Halia, and Amphithoe,
6150	Actaea, Limnorea, Melite,
6150	Doris, and Galatea, Panope;
6150	There too were Oreithyia, Clymene,
6150	And Amathea with the golden hair,
6150	And all the denizens of ocean's depths.
6150	Fill'd was the glassy cave; in unison
6150	They beat their breasts, as Thetis led the wail:
6150	""
6150	"""Give ear, my sister Nereids all, and learn"
6150	How deep the grief that in my breast I bear.
6150	Me miserable! me, of noblest son
6150	Unhappiest mother! me, a son who bore,
6150	My brave, my beautiful, of heroes chief!
6150	Like a young tree he throve: I tended him,
6150	In a rich vineyard as the choicest plant;
6150	Till in the beaked ships I sent him forth
6150	To war with Troy; him ne'er shall I behold,
6150	Returning home, in aged Peleus' house.
6150	E'en while he lives, and sees the light of day,
6150	He lives in sorrow; nor, to soothe his grief,
6150	My presence can avail; yet will I go,
6150	That I may see my dearest child, and learn
6150	"What grief hath reach'd him, from the war withdrawn."""
6150	""
6150	She said, and left the cave; with her they went,
6150	Weeping; before them parted th' ocean wave.
6150	But when they reach'd the fertile shore of Troy,
6150	In order due they landed on the beach,
6150	Where frequent, round Achilles swift of foot,
6150	Were moor'd the vessels of the Myrmidons.
6150	There, as he groan'd aloud, beside him stood
6150	His Goddess-mother; weeping, in her hands
6150	She held his head, while pitying thus she spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Why weeps my son? and what his cause of grief?"
6150	Speak out, and nought conceal; for all thy pray'r
6150	Which with uplifted hands thou mad'st to Jove,
6150	He hath fulfill'd, that, flying to their ships,
6150	The routed sons of Greece should feel how much
6150	"They need thine aid, and mourn their insult past."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Achilles, deeply groaning, thus:
6150	"""Mother, all this indeed hath Jove fulfill'd;"
6150	Yet what avails it, since my dearest friend
6150	Is slain, Patroclus? whom I honour'd most
6150	Of all my comrades, lov'd him as my soul.
6150	Him have I lost: and Hector from his corpse
6150	Hath stripp'd those arms, those weighty, beauteous arms,
6150	A marvel to behold, which from the Gods
6150	Peleus receiv'd, a glorious gift, that day
6150	When they consign'd thee to a mortal's bed.
6150	How better were it, if thy lot had been
6150	Still 'mid the Ocean deities to dwell,
6150	And Peleus had espous'd a mortal bride!
6150	For now is bitter grief for thee in store,
6150	Mourning thy son; whom to his home return'd
6150	Thou never more shalt see; nor would I wish
6150	To live, and move amid my fellow-men,
6150	Unless that Hector, vanquish'd by my spear,
6150	May lose his forfeit life, and pay the price
6150	"Of foul dishonour to Patroclus done."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, her tears o'erflowing, Thetis thus:
6150	"""E'en as thou sayst, my son, thy term is short;"
6150	"Nor long shall Hector's fate precede thine own."""
6150	""
6150	Achilles, answ'ring, spoke in passionate grief:
6150	"""Would I might die this hour, who fail'd to save"
6150	My comrade slain! far from his native land
6150	He died, sore needing my protecting arm;
6150	And I, who ne'er again must see my home,
6150	Nor to Patroclus, nor the many Greeks
6150	Whom Hector's hand hath slain, have render'd aid;
6150	But idly here I sit, cumb'ring the ground:
6150	I, who amid the Greeks no equal own
6150	In fight; to others, in debate, I yield.
6150	Accurs'd of Gods and men be hateful strife
6150	And anger, which to violence provokes
6150	E'en temp'rate souls: though sweeter be its taste
6150	Than dropping honey, in the heart of man
6150	Swelling, like smoke; such anger in my soul
6150	Hath Agamemnon kindled, King of men.
6150	But pass we that; though still my heart be sore,
6150	Yet will I school my angry spirit down.
6150	In search of Hector now, of him who slew
6150	My friend, I go; prepar'd to meet my death,
6150	When Jove shall will it, and th' Immortals all.
6150	From death not e'en the might of Hercules,
6150	Though best belov'd of Saturn's son, could fly,
6150	By fate and Juno's bitter wrath subdued.
6150	I too, since such my doom, must lie in death;
6150	Yet, ere I die, immortal fame will win;
6150	And from their delicate cheeks, deep-bosom'd dames,
6150	Dardan and Trojan, bitter tears shall wipe,
6150	And groan in anguish; then shall all men know
6150	How long I have been absent from the field;
6150	Then, though thou love me, seek not from the war
6150	"To stay my steps; for bootless were thy speech."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the silver-footed Queen:
6150	"""True are thy words, my son; and good it is,"
6150	And commendable, from the stroke of death
6150	To save a worsted comrade; but thine arms,
6150	Thy brazen, flashing arms, the Trojans hold:
6150	Them Hector of the glancing helm himself
6150	Bears on his breast, exulting; yet not long
6150	Shall be his triumph, for his doom is nigh.
6150	But thou, engage not in the toils of war,
6150	Until thine eyes again behold me here;
6150	For with to-morrow's sun will I return
6150	"With arms of heav'nly mould, by Vulcan wrought."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, from her son she turn'd away,
6150	And turning, to her sister Nereids spoke:
6150	"""Back to the spacious bosom of the deep"
6150	Retire ye now; and to my father's house,
6150	The aged Ocean God, your tidings bear;
6150	While I to high Olympus speed, to crave
6150	At Vulcan's hand, the skill'd artificer,
6150	"A boon of dazzling armour for my son."""
6150	""
6150	She said; and they beneath the ocean wave
6150	Descended, while to high Olympus sped
6150	The silver-footed Goddess, thence in hope
6150	To bear the dazzling armour to her son.
6150	She to Olympus sped; the Greeks meanwhile
6150	Before the warrior-slayer Hector fled
6150	With wild, tumultuous uproar, till they reach'd
6150	Their vessels and the shore of Hellespont.
6150	Nor had the well-greav'd Greets Achilles' friend,
6150	Patroclus, from amid the fray withdrawn;
6150	For close upon him follow'd horse and man,
6150	And Hector, son of Priam, fierce as flame;
6150	Thrice noble Hector, seizing from behind,
6150	Sought by the feet to drag away the dead,
6150	Cheering his friends; thrice, clad in warlike might,
6150	The two Ajaces drove him from his prey.
6150	Yet, fearless in his strength, now rushing on
6150	He dash'd amid the fray; now, shouting loud,
6150	Stood firm; but backward not a step retir'd.
6150	As from a carcase herdsmen strive in vain
6150	To scare a tawny lion, hunger-pinch'd;
6150	E'en so th' Ajaces, mail-clad warriors, fail'd
6150	The son of Priam from the corpse to scare.
6150	And now the body had he borne away,
6150	With endless fame; but from Olympus' height
6150	Came storm-swift Iris down to Peleus' son,
6150	And bade him don his arms; by Juno sent,
6150	Unknown to Jove, and to th' Immortals all.
6150	She stood beside him, and address'd him thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Up, son of Peleus! up, thou prince of men!"
6150	Haste to Patroclus' rescue; whom, around,
6150	Before the ships, is wag'd a fearful war,
6150	With mutual slaughter; these the dead defending,
6150	And those to Ilium's breezy heights intent
6150	To bear the body; noble Hector chief,
6150	Who longs to sever from the tender neck,
6150	And fix upon the spikes, thy comrade's head.
6150	Up then! delay no longer; deem it shame
6150	Patroclus' corpse should glut the dogs of Troy,
6150	"Dishon'ring thee, if aught dishonour him."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""Say, heav'nly Iris, of th' immortal Gods"
6150	"Who bade thee seek me, and this message bring?"""
6150	""
6150	"To whom swift Iris thus: ""To thee I come"
6150	By Juno sent, th' imperial wife of Jove;
6150	Unknown to Saturn's son, and all the Gods
6150	"Who on Olympus' snowy summit dwell."""
6150	""
6150	To whom again Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""How in the battle toil can I engage?"
6150	My arms are with the Trojans; and to boot
6150	My mother warn'd me not to arm for fight,
6150	Till I again should see her; for she hop'd
6150	To bring me heav'nly arms by Vulcan wrought:
6150	Nor know I well whose armour I could wear,
6150	Save the broad shield of Ajax Telamon
6150	And he, methinks, amid the foremost ranks
6150	"Ev'n now is fighting o'er Patroclus' corpse."""
6150	""
6150	"Whom answer'd storm-swift Iris: ""Well we know"
6150	Thy glorious arms are by the Trojans held;
6150	But go thou forth, and from above the ditch
6150	Appear before them; daunted at the sight,
6150	Haply the Trojans may forsake the field,
6150	And breathing-time afford the sons of Greece,
6150	"Toil-worn; for little pause has yet been theirs."""
6150	""
6150	Swift Iris said, and vanish'd; then uprose
6150	Achilles, dear to Jove; and Pallas threw
6150	Her tassell'd aegis o'er his shoulders broad;
6150	His head encircling with a coronet
6150	Of golden cloud, whence fiery flashes gleam'd.
6150	As from an island city up to Heav'n
6150	The smoke ascends, which hostile forces round
6150	Beleaguer, and all day with cruel war
6150	From its own state cut off; but when the sun
6150	Hath set, blaze frequent forth the beacon fires;
6150	High rise the flames, and to the dwellers round
6150	Their signal flash, if haply o'er the sea
6150	May come the needful aid; so brightly flash'd
6150	That fiery light around Achilles' head.
6150	He left the wall, and stood above the ditch,
6150	But from the Greeks apart, rememb'ring well
6150	His mother's prudent counsel; there he stood,
6150	And shouted loudly; Pallas join'd her voice,
6150	And fill'd with terror all the Trojan host.
6150	Clear as the trumpet's sound, which calls to arms
6150	Some town, encompass'd round with hostile bands,
6150	Rang out the voice of great AEacides.
6150	But when Achilles' voice of brass they heard,
6150	They quail'd in spirit; the sleek-skin'd steeds themselves,
6150	Conscious of coming ill, bore back the cars:
6150	Their charioteers, dismay'd, beheld the flame
6150	Which, kindled by the blue-ey'd Goddess, blaz'd
6150	Unquench'd around the head of Peleus' son.
6150	Thrice shouted from the ditch the godlike chief;
6150	Thrice terror struck both Trojans and Allies;
6150	And there and then beside their chariots fell
6150	Twelve of their bravest; while the Greeks, well pleas'd,
6150	Patroclus' body from the fray withdrew,
6150	And on a litter laid; around him stood
6150	His comrades mourning; with them, Peleus' son,
6150	Shedding hot tears, as on his friend he gaz'd,
6150	Laid on the bier, and pierc'd with deadly wounds:
6150	Him to the war with horses and with cars
6150	He sent; but ne'er to welcome his return.
6150	By stag-ey'd Juno sent, reluctant sank
6150	Th' unwearied sun beneath the ocean wave;
6150	The sun had set, and breath'd awhile the Greeks
6150	From the fierce labours of the balanc'd field;
6150	Nor less the Trojans, from the stubborn fight
6150	Retiring, from the chariots loos'd their steeds:
6150	But ere they shar'd the ev'ning meal, they met
6150	In council; all stood up; none dar'd to sit;
6150	For fear had fallen on all, when reappear'd
6150	Achilles, from the battle long withdrawn.
6150	First Panthous' son, the sage Polydamas,
6150	Address'd th' assembly; his sagacious mind
6150	Alone beheld the future and the past;
6150	The friend of Hector, born the selfsame night;
6150	One in debate, the other best in arms;
6150	Who thus with prudent speech began, and said:
6150	""
6150	"""Be well advis'd, my friends! my counsel is"
6150	That we regain the city, nor the morn
6150	Here in the plain, beside the ships, await,
6150	So far remov'd from our protecting walls.
6150	While fiercely burn'd 'gainst Atreus' godlike son
6150	That mighty warrior's wrath, 'twas easier far
6150	With th' other Greeks to deal; and I rejoic'd
6150	When by the ships we pass'd the night, in hopes
6150	We soon might call them ours; but now, I own
6150	Achilles, swift of foot, excites my fear.
6150	His proud, impetuous spirit will spurn the plain,
6150	Where Greeks and Trojans oft in warlike strife
6150	Their balanc'd strength exert; if he come forth,
6150	Our fight will be to guard our homes and wives.
6150	Gain we the city; trust me, so 'twere best.
6150	Now, for a while, ambrosial night detains
6150	The son of Peleus; but at early morn
6150	If issuing forth in arms he find us here,
6150	His prowess we shall know; and happy he
6150	Who, flying, shall in safety reach the walls
6150	Of sacred Troy; for many a Trojan slain
6150	Shall feed the vultures; Heav'n avert such fate!
6150	But if, though loth, ye will by me be rul'd,
6150	This night in council husband we our strength;
6150	While tow'rs, and lofty gates, and folding doors
6150	Close join'd, well-fitting, shall our city guard:
6150	Then issuing forth in arms at early morn
6150	Man we the tow'rs; so harder were his task
6150	If, from the ships advancing, round the wall
6150	He offer battle; bootless to return,
6150	His strong-neck'd horses worn with labour vain
6150	In coursing, purposeless, around the town.
6150	To force an entrance, or the town destroy,
6150	Is not his aim; and ere that end be gain'd,
6150	"The dogs of Troy upon his flesh shall feed."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm
6150	"With stern regard: ""Polydamas, thy words"
6150	Are such as grate unkindly on mine ear,
6150	Who fain wouldst have us to the walls retire.
6150	What? have ye not already long enough
6150	Been coop'd within the tow'rs? the wealth of Troy,
6150	Its brass, its gold, were once the common theme
6150	Of ev'ry tongue; our hoarded treasures now
6150	Are gone, to Phrygian and Maeonian shores
6150	For sale exported, costly merchandise,
6150	Since on our city fell the wrath of Jove.
6150	And now, when deep-designing Saturn's son
6150	Such glory gives me as to gain the ships,
6150	And, crowded by the sea, hem in the Greeks,
6150	Fool! put not thou these timid counsels forth,
6150	Which none will follow, nor will I allow.
6150	But hear ye all, and do as I advise:
6150	Share now the meal, by ranks, throughout the host;
6150	Then set your watch, and each keep careful guard;
6150	And whom his spoils o'erload, if such there be,
6150	Let him divide them with the gen'ral crowd;
6150	Better that they should hold them than the Greeks:
6150	And with the morn, in arms, beside the ships,
6150	Will we again awake the furious war.
6150	But if indeed Achilles by the ships
6150	Hath reappear'd, himself, if so he choose,
6150	Shall be the suff'rer; from the perilous strife
6150	I will not shrink, but his encounter meet:
6150	So he, or I, shall gain immortal fame;
6150	"Impartial Mars hath oft the slayer slain."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Hector spoke; the Trojans cheer'd aloud:
6150	Fools, and by Pallas of their sense bereft,
6150	Who all applauded Hector's ill advice,
6150	None the sage counsel of Polydamas!
6150	Then through the camp they shar'd the ev'ning meal.
6150	""
6150	Meantime the Greeks all night with tears and groans
6150	Bewail'd Patroclus: on his comrade's breast
6150	Achilles laid his murder-dealing hands,
6150	And led with bitter groans the loud lament.
6150	As when the hunters, in the forest's depth,
6150	Have robb'd a bearded lion of his cubs;
6150	Too late arriving, he with anger chafes;
6150	Then follows, if perchance he may o'ertake,
6150	Through many a mountain glen, the hunters' steps,
6150	With grief and fury fill'd; so Peleus' son,
6150	With bitter groans, the Myrmidons address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Vain was, alas! the promise which I gave,"
6150	Seeking the brave Menoetius to console,
6150	To bring to Opus back his gallant son,
6150	Rich with his share of spoil from Troy o'erthrown;
6150	But Jove fulfils not all that man designs:
6150	For us hath fate decreed, that here in Troy
6150	We two one soil should redden with our blood;
6150	Nor me, returning to my native land,
6150	Shall aged Peleus in his halls receive,
6150	Nor Thetis; here must earth retain my bones.
6150	But since, Patroclus, I am doom'd on earth
6150	Behind thee to remain, thy fun'ral rites
6150	I will not celebrate, till Hector's arms,
6150	And head, thy haughty slayer's, here I bring;
6150	And on thy pyre twelve noble sons of Troy
6150	Will sacrifice, in vengeance of thy death.
6150	Thou by our beaked ships till then must lie;
6150	And weeping o'er thee shall deep-bosom'd dames,
6150	Trojan and Dardan, mourn both night and day;
6150	The prizes of our toil, when wealthy towns
6150	"Before our valour and our spears have fall'n."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and bade his comrades on the fire
6150	An ample tripod place, without delay
6150	To cleanse Patroclus from the bloody gore:
6150	They on the burning fire the tripod plac'd,
6150	With water fill'd, and kindled wood beneath.
6150	Around the bellying tripod rose the flames,
6150	Heating the bath; within the glitt'ring brass
6150	Soon as the water boil'd, they wash'd the corpse,
6150	With lissom oils anointing, and the wounds
6150	With fragrant ointments fill'd, of nine years old;
6150	Then in fine linen they the body wrapp'd
6150	From head to feet, and laid it on a couch.
6150	And cover'd over with a fair white sheet.
6150	All night around Achilles swift of foot
6150	The Myrmidons with tears Patroclus mourn'd.
6150	""
6150	To Juno then, his sister and his wife,
6150	"Thus Saturn's son: ""At length thou hast thy will,"
6150	Imperial Juno, who hast stirr'd to war
6150	Achilles swift of foot; well might one deem
6150	"These long-hair'd Greeks from thee deriv'd their birth."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer thus the stag-ey'd Queen:
6150	"""What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
6150	E'en man, though mortal, and inferior far
6150	To us in wisdom, might so much effect
6150	Against his fellow-man; then how should I,
6150	By double title chief of Goddesses,
6150	First by my birth, and next because thy wife
6150	I boast me, thine, o'er all the Gods supreme,
6150	"Not work my vengeance on the Trojan race?"""
6150	""
6150	Such, converse while they held, to Vulcan's house,
6150	Immortal, starlike bright, among the Gods
6150	Unrivall'd, all of brass, by Vulcan's self
6150	Constructed, sped the silver-footed Queen.
6150	Him swelt'ring at his forge she found, intent
6150	On forming twenty tripods, which should stand
6150	The wall surrounding of his well-built house;
6150	With golden wheels beneath he furnish'd each,
6150	And to th' assembly of the Gods endued
6150	With pow'r to move spontaneous, and return,
6150	A marvel to behold! thus far his work
6150	He had completed; but not yet had fix'd
6150	The rich-wrought handles; these his labour now
6150	Engag'd, to fit them, and to rivet fast.
6150	While thus he exercis'd his practis'd skill,
6150	The silver-footed Queen approach'd the house.
6150	Charis, the skilful artist's wedded wife,
6150	Beheld her coming, and advanc'd to meet;
6150	And, as her hand she clasp'd, address'd her thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Say, Thetis of the flowing robe, belov'd"
6150	And honour'd, whence this visit to our house,
6150	An unaccustom'd guest? but come thou in,
6150	"That I may welcome thee with honour due."""
6150	""
6150	Thus, as she spoke, the Goddess led her in,
6150	And on a seat with silver studs adorn'd,
6150	Fair, richly wrought, a footstool at her feet,
6150	She bade her sit; then thus to Vulcan call'd:
6150	"""Haste hither, Vulcan; Thetis asks thine aid."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the skill'd artificer:
6150	"""An honour'd and a venerated guest"
6150	Our house contains; who sav'd me once from woe,
6150	When by my mother's act from Heav'n I fell,
6150	Who, for that I was crippled in my feet,
6150	Deem'd it not shame to hide me: hard had then
6150	My fortune been, had not Eurynome
6150	And Thetis in their bosoms shelter'd me;
6150	Eurynome, from old Oceanus
6150	Who drew her birth, the ever-circling flood.
6150	Nine years with them I dwelt, and many a work
6150	I fashion'd there of metal, clasps, and chains
6150	Of spiral coil, rich cups, and collars fair,
6150	Hid in a cave profound; where th' ocean stream
6150	With ceaseless murmur foam'd and moan'd around;
6150	Unknown to God or man, but to those two
6150	Who sav'd me, Thetis and Eurynome.
6150	Now to my house hath fair-hair'd Thetis come;
6150	To her, my life preserv'd its tribute owes:
6150	Then thou the hospitable rites perform.
6150	"While I my bellows and my tools lay by."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and from the anvil rear'd upright
6150	His massive strength; and as he limp'd along,
6150	His tottering knees were bow'd beneath his weight.
6150	The bellows from the fire he next withdrew,
6150	And in a silver casket plac'd his tools;
6150	Then with a sponge his brows and lusty arms
6150	He wip'd, and sturdy neck and hairy chest.
6150	He donn'd his robe, and took his weighty staff;
6150	Then through the door with halting step he pass'd;
6150	There waited on their King the attendant maids;
6150	In form as living maids, but wrought in gold;
6150	Instinct with consciousness, with voice endued,
6150	And strength, and skill from heav'nly teachers drawn.
6150	These waited, duteous, at the Monarch's side,
6150	His steps supporting; he, with halting gait,
6150	Pass'd to a gorgeous chair by Thetis' side,
6150	And, as her hand he clasp'd, address'd her thus:
6150	""
6150	"""Say, Thetis of the flowing robe, belov'd"
6150	And honour'd, whence this visit to our house.
6150	An unaccustom'd guest? say what thy will,
6150	"And, if within my pow'r, esteem it done."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer Thetis, weeping, thus:
6150	"""Vulcan, of all the Goddesses who dwell"
6150	On high Olympus, lives there one whose soul
6150	Hath borne such weight of woe, so many griefs,
6150	As Saturn's son hath heap'd on me alone?
6150	Me, whom he chose from all the sea-born nymphs,
6150	And gave to Peleus, son of AEacus,
6150	His subject; I endur'd a mortal's bed,
6150	Though sore against my will; he now, bent down
6150	By feeble age, lies helpless in his house.
6150	Now adds he farther grief; he granted me
6150	To bear, and rear, a son, of heroes chief;
6150	Like a young tree he throve; I tended him,
6150	In a rich vineyard as the choicest plant:
6150	Till in the beaked ships I sent him forth
6150	To war with Troy; him ne'er shall I receive,
6150	Returning home, in aged Peleus' house.
6150	E'en while he lives, and sees the light of day,
6150	He lives in sorrow; nor, to soothe his grief,
6150	My presence can avail; a girl, his prize,
6150	Selected for him by the sons of Greece,
6150	Great Agamemnon wrested from his arms:
6150	In grief and rage he pin'd his soul away;
6150	Then by the Trojans were the Greeks hemm'd in
6150	Beside their ships, and from within their camp
6150	No outlet found; the Grecian Elders then
6150	Implor'd his aid, and promis'd costly gifts.
6150	With his own hand to save them he refus'd;
6150	But, in his armour clad, to battle sent
6150	His friend Patroclus, with a num'rous band.
6150	All day they fought before the Scaean* gates;
6150	And in that day had Ilium been destroy'd,
6150	But in the van, Menoetius' noble son.
6150	After great deeds achiev'd, Apollo slew,
6150	And crown'd with glory Hector, Priam's son.
6150	Therefore a suppliant to thy knees I come,
6150	If to my son, to early death condemn'd,
6150	Thou wilt accord the boon of shield and helm,
6150	And well-wrought greaves with silver clasps secur'd,
6150	And breastplate; for his own, his faithful friend,
6150	By Trojan hands subdued, hath lost; and he,
6150	"O'erwhelm'd with grief, lies prostrate on the earth."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the skill'd artificer:
6150	"""Take comfort, nor let this disturb thy mind;"
6150	Would that as surely, when his hour shall come,
6150	I could defend him from the stroke of death,
6150	As I can undertake that his shall be
6150	"Such arms as they shall marvel who behold."""
6150	""
6150	He left her thus, and to his forge return'd;
6150	The bellows then directing to the fire,
6150	He bade them work; through twenty pipes at once
6150	Forthwith they pour'd their diverse-temper'd blasts;
6150	Now briskly seconding his eager haste,
6150	Now at his will, and as the work requir'd.
6150	The stubborn brass, and tin, and precious gold,
6150	And silver, first he melted in the fire,
6150	Then on its stand his weighty anvil plac'd;
6150	And with one hand the hammer's pond'rous weight
6150	He wielded, while the other grasp'd the tongs.
6150	""
6150	And first a shield he fashion'd, vast and strong,
6150	With rich adornment; circled with a rim,
6150	Threefold, bright-gleaming, whence a silver belt
6150	Depended; of five folds the shield was form'd;
6150	And on its surface many a rare design
6150	Of curious art his practis'd skill had wrought.
6150	""
6150	Thereon were figur'd earth, and sky, and sea,
6150	The ever-circling sun, and full-orb'd moon,
6150	And all the signs that crown the vault of Heav'n;
6150	Pleiads and Hyads, and Orion's might,
6150	And Arctos, call'd the Wain, who wheels on high
6150	His circling course, and on Orion waits;
6150	Sole star that never bathes in th' ocean wave.
6150	""
6150	And two fair populous towns were sculptur'd there;
6150	In one were marriage pomp and revelry.
6150	And brides, in gay procession, through the streets
6150	With blazing torches from their chambers borne,
6150	While frequent rose the hymeneal song.
6150	Youths whirl'd around in joyous dance, with sound
6150	Of flute and harp; and, standing at their doors,
6150	Admiring women on the pageant gaz'd.
6150	""
6150	Meanwhile a busy throng the forum fill'd:
6150	There between two a fierce contention rose,
6150	About a death-fine; to the public one
6150	Appeal'd, asserting to have paid the whole;
6150	While one denied that he had aught receiv'd.
6150	Both were desirous that before the Judge
6150	The issue should be tried; with noisy shouts
6150	Their several partisans encourag'd each.
6150	The heralds still'd the tumult of the crowd:
6150	On polish'd chairs, in solemn circle, sat
6150	The rev'rend Elders; in their hands they held
6150	The loud-voic'd heralds' sceptres; waving these,
6150	They heard th' alternate pleadings; in the midst
6150	Two talents lay of gold, which he should take
6150	Who should before them prove his righteous cause.
6150	""
6150	Before the second town two armies lay,
6150	In arms refulgent; to destroy the town
6150	Th' assailants threaten'd, or among themselves
6150	Of all the wealth within the city stor'd
6150	An equal half, as ransom, to divide.
6150	The terms rejecting, the defenders mann'd
6150	A secret ambush; on the walls they plac'd
6150	Women and children muster'd for defence,
6150	And men by age enfeebled; forth they went,
6150	By Mars and Pallas led; these, wrought in gold,
6150	In golden arms array'd, above the crowd
6150	For beauty and stature, as befitting Gods,
6150	Conspicuous shone; of lesser height the rest.
6150	But when the destin'd ambuscade was reach'd,
6150	Beside the river, where the shepherds drove
6150	Their flocks and herds to water, down they lay,
6150	In glitt'ring arms accoutred; and apart
6150	They plac'd two spies, to notify betimes
6150	Th' approach of flocks of sheep and lowing herds.
6150	These, in two shepherds' charge, ere long appear'd,
6150	Who, unsuspecting as they mov'd along,
6150	Enjoy'd the music of their past'ral pipes.
6150	They on the booty, from afar discern'd,
6150	Sprang from their ambuscade; and cutting off
6150	The herds, and fleecy flocks, their guardians slew.
6150	Their comrades heard the tumult, where they sat
6150	Before their sacred altars, and forthwith
6150	Sprang on their cars, and with fast-stepping steeds
6150	Pursued the plund'rers, and o'ertook them soon.
6150	There on the river's bank they met in arms,
6150	And each at other hurl'd their brazen spears.
6150	And there were figur'd Strife, and Tumult wild,
6150	And deadly Fate, who in her iron grasp
6150	One newly-wounded, one unwounded bore,
6150	While by the feet from out the press she dragg'd
6150	Another slain: about her shoulders hung
6150	A garment crimson'd with the blood of men.
6150	Like living men they seem'd to move, to fight,
6150	To drag away the bodies of the slain.
6150	""
6150	And there was grav'n a wide-extended plain
6150	Of fallow land, rich, fertile, mellow soil,
6150	Thrice plough'd; where many ploughmen up and down
6150	Their teams were driving; and as each attain'd
6150	The limit of the field, would one advance,
6150	And tender him a cup of gen'rous wine:
6150	Then would he turn, and to the end again
6150	Along the furrow cheerly drive his plough.
6150	And still behind them darker show'd the soil,
6150	The true presentment of a new-plough'd field,
6150	Though wrought in gold; a miracle of art.
6150	""
6150	There too was grav'n a corn-field, rich in grain,
6150	Where with sharp sickles reapers plied their task,
6150	And thick, in even swathe, the trusses fell;
6150	The binders, following close, the bundles tied:
6150	Three were the binders; and behind them boys
6150	In close attendance waiting, in their arms
6150	Gather'd the bundles, and in order pil'd.
6150	Amid them, staff in hand, in silence stood
6150	The King, rejoicing in the plenteous swathe.
6150	A little way remov'd, the heralds slew
6150	A sturdy ox, and now beneath an oak
6150	Prepar'd the feast; while women mix'd, hard by,
6150	White barley porridge for the lab'rers' meal.
6150	""
6150	And, with rich clusters laden, there was grav'n
6150	A vineyard fair, all gold; of glossy black
6150	The bunches were, on silver poles sustain'd;
6150	Around, a darksome trench; beyond, a fence
6150	Was wrought, of shining tin; and through it led
6150	One only path, by which the bearers pass'd,
6150	Who gather'd in the vineyard's bounteous store.
6150	There maids and youths, in joyous spirits bright,
6150	In woven baskets bore the luscious fruit.
6150	A boy, amid them, from a clear-ton'd harp
6150	Drew lovely music; well his liquid voice
6150	The strings accompanied; they all with dance
6150	And song harmonious join'd, and joyous shouts,
6150	As the gay bevy lightly tripp'd along.
6150	""
6150	Of straight-horn'd cattle too a herd was grav'n;
6150	Of gold and tin the heifers all were wrought:
6150	They to the pasture, from the cattle-yard,
6150	With gentle lowings, by a babbling stream,
6150	Where quiv'ring reed-beds rustled, slowly mov'd.
6150	Four golden shepherds walk'd beside the herd,
6150	By nine swift dogs attended; then amid
6150	The foremost heifers sprang two lions fierce
6150	Upon the lordly bull: he, bellowing loud,
6150	Was dragg'd along, by dogs and youths pursued.
6150	The tough bull's-hide they tore, and gorging lapp'd
6150	Th' intestines and dark blood; with vain attempt
6150	The herdsmen following closely, to the attack
6150	Cheer'd their swift dogs; these shunn'd the lions' jaws,
6150	And close around them baying, held aloof.
6150	""
6150	And there the skilful artist's hand had trac'd
6150	A pastaro broad, with fleecy flocks o'erspread,
6150	In a fair glade, with fold, and tents, and pens.
6150	""
6150	There, too, the skilful artist's hand had wrought
6150	With curious workmanship, a mazy dance,
6150	Like that which Daedalus in Cnossus erst
6150	At fair-hair'd Ariadne's bidding fram'd.
6150	There, laying each on other's wrists their hand,
6150	Bright youths and many-suitor'd maidens danc'd:
6150	In fair white linen these; in tunics those,
6150	Well woven, shining soft with fragrant oils;
6150	These with fair coronets were crown'd, while those
6150	With golden swords from silver belts were girt.
6150	Now whirl'd they round with nimble practis'd feet,
6150	Easy, as when a potter, seated, turns
6150	A wheel, new fashion'd by his skilful hand,
6150	And spins it round, to prove if true it run;
6150	Now featly mov'd in well-beseeming ranks.
6150	A num'rous crowd, around, the lovely dance
6150	Survey'd, delighted; while an honour'd Bard
6150	Sang, as he struck the lyre, and to the strain
6150	Two tumblers, in the midst, were whirling round.
6150	""
6150	About the margin of the massive shield
6150	Was wrought the mighty strength of th' ocean stream.
6150	""
6150	The shield completed, vast and strong, he forg'd
6150	A breastplate, dazzling bright as flame of fire;
6150	And next, a weighty helmet for his head,
6150	Fair, richly wrought, with crest of gold above;
6150	Then last, well-fitting greaves of pliant tin.
6150	""
6150	The skill'd artificer his works complete
6150	Before Achilles' Goddess-mother laid:
6150	She, like a falcon, from the snow-clad heights
6150	Of huge Olympus, darted swiftly down,
6150	Charg'd with the glitt'ring arms by Vulcan wrought.

6150	THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the
6150	body of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the
6150	army, to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are
6150	solemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that
6150	occasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from
6150	the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves, by the advice of
6150	Ulysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles: where
6150	Briseis laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately
6150	refuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his
6150	friend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He
6150	arms for the fight; his appearance described. He addresses himself to
6150	his horses, and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of
6150	them is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his
6150	fate; but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to

6150	""
6150	Now morn in saffron robe, from th' ocean stream
6150	Ascending, light diffus'd o'er Gods and men;
6150	As Thetis, to the ships returning, bore
6150	The gift of Vulcan; there her son she found,
6150	Who o'er Patroclus hung in bitter grief;
6150	Around him mourn'd his comrades; in the midst
6150	She stood, and clasp'd his hand, as thus she spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Leave we, my son, though deep our grief, the dead;"
6150	Here let him lie, since Heav'n hath doom'd his fall;
6150	But thou these arms receive, by Vulcan sent,
6150	"Fairer than e'er on mortal breast were borne."""
6150	The arms before Achilles, as she spoke,
6150	The Goddess laid; loud rang the wondrous work.
6150	With awe the Myrmidons beheld; nor dar'd
6150	Affront the sight: but as Achilles gaz'd,
6150	More fiery burn'd his wrath; beneath his brows
6150	His eyes like lightning flash'd; with fierce delight
6150	He seiz'd the glorious gift: and when his soul
6150	Had feasted on the miracle of art,
6150	To Thetis thus his winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Mother, the God hath giv'n me arms indeed,"
6150	Worthy a God, and such as mortal man
6150	Could never forge; I go to arm me straight;
6150	Yet fear I for Menoetius' noble son,
6150	Lest in his spear-inflicted wounds the flies
6150	May gender worms, and desecrate the dead,
6150	"And, life extinct, corruption reach his flesh."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the silver-footed Queen:
6150	"""Let not such fears, my son, disturb thy mind:"
6150	I will myself the swarms of flies disperse,
6150	That on the flesh of slaughter'd warriors prey:
6150	And should he here remain a year complete,
6150	Still should his flesh be firm and fresh as now:
6150	But thou to council call the chiefs of Greece;
6150	Against the monarch Agamemnon there,
6150	The leader of the host, abjure thy wrath;
6150	"Then arm thee quickly, and put on thy might."""
6150	""
6150	Her words with dauntless courage fill'd his breast.
6150	She in Patroclus' nostrils, to preserve
6150	His flesh, red nectar and ambrosia pour'd.
6150	""
6150	Along the ocean beach Achilles pass'd,
6150	And loudly shouting, call'd on all the chiefs;
6150	Then all who heretofore remain'd on board,
6150	The steersmen, who the vessels' rudders hold,
6150	The very stewards that serv'd the daily bread,
6150	All to th' assembly throng'd, when reappear'd
6150	Achilles, from the fight so long withdrawn.
6150	Two noble chiefs, two ministers of Mars,
6150	Ulysses sage, and valiant Diomed,
6150	Appear'd, yet crippled by their grievous wounds,
6150	Their halting steps supporting with their spears,
6150	And on the foremost seats their places took.
6150	Next follow'd Agamemnon, King of men,
6150	He also wounded; for Antenor's son,
6150	Coon, had stabb'd him in the stubborn fight.
6150	When all the Greeks were closely throng'd around,
6150	Up rose Achilles swift of foot, and said:
6150	""
6150	"""Great son of Atreus, what hath been the gain"
6150	To thee or me, since heart-consuming strife
6150	Hath fiercely rag'd between us, for a girl,
6150	Who would to Heav'n had died by Dian's shafts
6150	That day when from Lyrnessus' captur'd town
6150	I bore her off? so had not many a Greek
6150	Bitten the bloody dust, by hostile hands
6150	Subdued, while I in anger stood aloof.
6150	Great was the gain to Troy; but Greeks, methinks,
6150	Will long retain the mem'ry of our feud.
6150	Yet pass we that; and though our hearts be sore,
6150	Still let us school our angry spirits down.
6150	My wrath I here abjure; it is not meet
6150	It burn for ever unappeas'd; do thou
6150	Muster to battle straight the long-hair'd Greeks;
6150	That, to the Trojans once again oppos'd,
6150	I may make trial if beside the ships
6150	They dare this night remain; but he, I ween,
6150	Will gladly rest his limbs, who safe shall fly,
6150	"My spear escaping, from the battle-field."""
6150	""
6150	He said: the well-greav'd Greeks rejoic'd to hear
6150	His wrath abjur'd by Peleus' godlike son;
6150	And from his seat, not standing in the midst,
6150	Thus to th' assembly Agamemnon spoke:
6150	"""Friends, Grecian Heroes, Ministers of Mars,"
6150	When one stands up to speak, 'tis meet for all
6150	To lend a patient ear, nor interrupt;
6150	For e'en to practis'd speakers hard the task:
6150	But, in this vast assembly, who can speak
6150	That all may hear? the clearest voice must fail.
6150	To Peleus' son, Achilles, I my mind
6150	Will frankly open; ye among yourselves
6150	Impart the words I speak, that all may know.
6150	Oft hath this matter been by Greeks discuss'd,
6150	And I their frequent censure have incurr'd:
6150	Yet was not I the cause; but Jove, and Fate,
6150	And gloomy Erinnys, who combin'd to throw
6150	A strong delusion o'er my mind, that day
6150	I robb'd Achilles of his lawful prize.
6150	What could I do? a Goddess all o'er-rul'd,
6150	Daughter of Jove, dread Ate, baleful pow'r,
6150	Misleading all; with lightest step she moves,
6150	Not on the earth, but o'er the heads of men,
6150	With blighting touch; and many hath caus'd to err.
6150	E'en Jove, the wisest deem'd of Gods and men,
6150	In error she involv'd, when Juno's art
6150	By female stratagem the God deceiv'd,
6150	When in well-girdled Thebes Alcmena lay
6150	In travail of the might of Hercules.
6150	In boastful tone amid the Gods he spoke:
6150	'Hear all ye Gods, and all ye Goddesses,
6150	The words I speak, the promptings of my soul.
6150	This day Lucina shall to light bring forth
6150	A child, the future Lord of all around,
6150	Of mortal men, who trace to me their blood.'
6150	Whom answer'd Juno thus, with deep deceit:
6150	'Thou dost but feign, nor wilt fulfil thy word:
6150	Come now, Olympian, swear a solemn oath
6150	That he shall be the Lord of all around,
6150	Who on this day shall be of woman born,
6150	Of mortal men, who trace to thee their blood.'
6150	She said, and Jove, the snare unseeing, swore
6150	A solemn oath; but found his error soon.
6150	Down from Olympus' height she sped in haste
6150	To Argos of Achaia; for the wife
6150	Of Sthenelus, the son of Perseus, there,
6150	She knew, was sev'n months pregnant of a son;
6150	Whom, though untimely born, she brought to light,
6150	Staying meanwhile Alcmena's labour-pangs,
6150	To Saturn's son herself the tidings brought,
6150	And thus address'd him: 'Jove, the lightning's Lord,
6150	I bring thee news; this day a mighty man,
6150	By thee ordain'd to be the Argives' King,
6150	Is born, Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus,
6150	The son of Perseus, issue of thy blood;
6150	Well worthy he to be the Argives' King.'
6150	She said: keen sorrow deeply pierc'd his soul;
6150	Then Ate by the glossy locks he seiz'd
6150	In mighty wrath; and swore a solemn oath,
6150	That to Olympus and the starry Heav'n
6150	She never should return, who all misleads.
6150	His arm then whirling, from the starry Heav'n
6150	He flung her down, to vex th' affairs of men.
6150	Yet oft her fraud remember'd he with groans,
6150	When by Eurystheus' hard commands he saw
6150	Condemn'd to servile tasks his noble son.
6150	So, oft as Hector of the glancing helm
6150	Beside the ships the Greeks to slaughter gave,
6150	Back to my mind my former error came.
6150	I err'd, for Jove my judgment took away;
6150	But friendly reconcilement now I seek,
6150	And tender costly presents; then thyself
6150	Uprouse thee, and excite the rest to arms.
6150	While I prepare the gifts, whate'er of late                     [6]
6150	The sage Ulysses promis'd in thy tent:
6150	Or, if thou wilt, though eager for the fray,
6150	Remain thou here awhile, till from my ship
6150	My followers bring the gifts; that thou mayst see
6150	"I make my offerings with no niggard hand."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Achilles swift of foot:
6150	"""Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6150	The gifts thou deem'st befitting, 'tis for thee
6150	To give, or to withhold; but now at once
6150	Prepare we for the battle; 'tis not meet
6150	On trivial pretexts here to waste our time,
6150	Or idly loiter; much remains to do:
6150	Again be seen Achilles in the van,
6150	Scatt'ring with brazen spear the Trojan ranks;
6150	"And ye, forget not man with man to fight."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer sage Ulysses thus:
6150	"""Brave as thou art, Achilles, godlike chief,"
6150	Yet fasting lead not forth the sons of Greece
6150	To fight the Trojans; for no little time
6150	Will last the struggle, when the serried ranks
6150	Are once engag'd in conflict, and the Gods
6150	With equal courage either side inspire:
6150	But bid them, by the ships, of food and wine
6150	(Wherein are strength and courage) first partake;
6150	For none throughout the day till set of sun,
6150	Fasting from food, may bear the toils of war;
6150	His spirit may still be eager for the fray;
6150	Yet are his limbs by slow degrees weigh'd down,
6150	Himself by thirst and hunger worn, his knees
6150	Unable, as he moves, to bear his weight.
6150	But he who, first with food and wine refresh'd,
6150	All day maintains the combat with the foe,
6150	His spirit retains unbroken, and his limbs
6150	Unwearied, till both armies quit the field.
6150	Disperse then now the crowd, and bid prepare
6150	The morning meal; meantime to public view
6150	Let Agamemnon, King of men, display
6150	His costly gifts; that all the Greeks may see,
6150	And that thy heart within thee melt with joy:
6150	And there in full assembly let him swear
6150	A solemn oath, that he hath ne'er approach'd
6150	The fair Briseis' bed, nor held with her
6150	Such intercourse as man with woman holds.
6150	Be thou propitious, and accept his oath.
6150	Then at a sumptuous banquet in his tent
6150	Let him receive thee; that thine honour due
6150	May nothing lack; and so, Atrides, thou
6150	Shalt stand in sight of all men clear of blame;
6150	For none can wonder that insulting speech
6150	"Should rouse the anger of a sceptred King."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Agamemnon, King of men:
6150	"""Son of Laertes, I accept thy speech"
6150	With cordial welcome: all that thou hast said
6150	Is well and wisely spoken; for the oath,
6150	I am prepar'd, with willing mind, to swear;
6150	Nor in the sight of Heav'n will be forsworn.
6150	Let then Achilles here awhile remain,
6150	Though eager for the fray; ye too remain,
6150	Until the presents from my tent be brought,
6150	And we our solemn compact ratify.
6150	Then this command upon thyself I lay:
6150	That thou the noblest youths of all the Greeks
6150	Select, and bid them from my vessel bear
6150	The gifts, which, to Achilles yesternight
6150	We promis'd, and withal the women bring;
6150	And let Talthybius through the host seek out
6150	"A boar, for sacrifice to Jove and Sol."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Achilles swift of foot:
6150	"""Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6150	These matters to some future time were best
6150	Deferr'd, some hour of respite from the fight,
6150	Of rage less fiercely burning in my breast;
6150	But slaughter'd now they lie, whom Priam's son,
6150	Hector, hath slain, by Jove to vict'ry led.
6150	Ye bid us take our food; if I might rule,
6150	I would to battle lead the sons of Greece,
6150	Unfed, and fasting; and at set of sun,
6150	Our shame aveng'd, an ample feast prepare;
6150	Till then, nor food nor drink shall pass my lips,
6150	My comrade slain; who pierc'd with mortal wounds,
6150	Turn'd tow'rd the doorway, lies within my tent,
6150	His mourning friends around; while there he lies,
6150	No thought have I for these or aught beside,
6150	"Save carnage, blood, and groans of dying men."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Ulysses, sage in council, thus:
6150	"""O son of Peleus, noblest of the Greeks,"
6150	How far, Achilles, thou surpassest me
6150	In deeds of arms, I know: but thou must yield
6150	To me in counsel, for my years are more,
6150	And my experience greater far than thine:
6150	Then to my words incline a patient ear.
6150	Men soonest weary of battle, where the sword
6150	The bloodiest harvest reaps; the lightest crop
6150	Of slaughter is where Jove inclines the scale,
6150	Dispenser, at his will, of human wars.
6150	The Greeks by fasting cannot mourn their dead;
6150	For day by day successive numbers fall;
6150	Where were the respite then from ceaseless fast?
6150	Behoves us bury out of sight our dead,
6150	Steeling our hearts, and weeping but a day;
6150	And we, the rest, whom cruel war has spar'd,
6150	Should first with food and wine recruit out strength;
6150	Then, girding on our arms, the livelong day
6150	Maintain the war, unwearied; then let none
6150	Require a farther summons to the field;
6150	(And woe to him who loit'ring by the ships
6150	That summons hears;) but with united force
6150	"Against the Trojans wake the furious war."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and call'd on noble Nestor's sons,
6150	On Meges, Phyleus' son, Meriones,
6150	Thoas, and Lycomedes, Creon's son,
6150	And Melanippus; they together sought
6150	The mighty monarch Agamemnon's tent.
6150	Soon as the word was giv'n, the work was done;
6150	Sev'n tripods brought they out, the promis'd gifts;
6150	Twelve horses, twenty caldrons glitt'ring bright;
6150	Sev'n women too, well skill'd in household cares,
6150	With whom, the eighth, the fair Briseis came.
6150	Ulysses led the way, and with him brought
6150	Ten talents full of gold; th' attendant youths
6150	The other presents bore, and in the midst
6150	Display'd before th' assembly: then uprose
6150	The monarch Agamemnon; by his side,
6150	With voice of godlike pow'r, Talthybius stood,
6150	Holding the victim: then Atrides drew
6150	The dagger, ever hanging at his side,
6150	Close by the scabbard of his mighty sword,
6150	And from the victim's head the bristles shore.
6150	With hands uplifted then to Jove he pray'd;
6150	While all around the Greeks in silence stood,
6150	List'ning, decorous, to the monarch's words,
6150	As looking up to Heav'n he made his pray'r:
6150	""
6150	"""Be witness, Jove, thou highest, first of Gods,"
6150	And Sun, and Earth, and ye who vengeance wreak
6150	Beneath the earth on souls of men forsworn,
6150	Furies! that never, or to love unchaste
6150	Soliciting, or otherwise, my hand
6150	Hath fair Briseis touch'd; but in my tent
6150	Still pure and undefil'd hath she remain'd:
6150	And if in this I be forsworn, may Heav'n
6150	With all the plagues afflict me, due to those
6150	"Who sin by perjur'd oaths against the Gods."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, across the victim's throat
6150	He drew the pitiless blade; Talthybius then
6150	To hoary Ocean's depths the carcase threw,
6150	Food for the fishes; then Achilles rose,
6150	And thus before th' assembled Greeks he spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""O Father Jove, how dost thou lead astray"
6150	Our human judgments! ne'er had Atreus' son
6150	My bosom fill'd with wrath, nor from my arms,
6150	To his own loss, against my will had torn
6150	The girl I lov'd, but that the will of Jove
6150	To death predestin'd many a valiant Greek.
6150	"Now to the meal; anon renew the war."""
6150	""
6150	This said, th' assembly he dismiss'd in haste,
6150	The crowd dispersing to their sev'ral ships;
6150	Upon the gifts the warlike Myrmidons
6150	Bestow'd their care, and bore them to the ships;
6150	Of Peleus' godlike son; within the tent
6150	They laid them down, and there the women plac'd,
6150	While to the drove the followers led the steeds.
6150	Briseis, fair as golden Venus, saw
6150	Patroclus lying, pierc'd with mortal wounds,
6150	Within the tent; and with a bitter cry,
6150	She flung her down upon the corpse, and tore
6150	Her breast, her delicate neck, and beauteous cheeks;
6150	And, weeping, thus the lovely woman wail'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Patroclus, dearly lov'd of this sad heart!"
6150	When last I left this tent, I left thee full
6150	Of healthy life; returning now, I find
6150	Only thy lifeless corpse, thou Prince of men!
6150	So sorrow still, on sorrow heap'd, I bear.
6150	The husband of my youth, to whom my sire
6150	And honour'd mother gave me, I beheld
6150	Slain with the sword before the city walls:
6150	Three brothers, whom with me one mother bore,
6150	My dearly lov'd ones, all were doom'd to death:
6150	Nor wouldst thou, when Achilles swift of foot
6150	My husband slew, and royal Mynes' town
6150	In ruin laid, allow my tears to flow;
6150	But thou wouldst make me (such was still thy speech)
6150	The wedded wife of Peleus' godlike son:
6150	Thou wouldst to Phthia bear me in thy ship,
6150	And there, thyself, amid the Myrmidons,
6150	Wouldst give my marriage feast; then, unconsol'd,
6150	"I weep thy death, my ever-gentle friend!"""
6150	""
6150	Weeping, she spoke; the women join'd her wail:
6150	Patroclus' death the pretext for their tears,
6150	But each in secret wept her private griefs.
6150	""
6150	Around Achilles throng'd the elder men,
6150	Urging to eat; but he, with groans, refus'd:
6150	"""I pray you, would you show your love, dear friends,"
6150	Ask me not now with food or drink to appease
6150	Hunger or thirst; a load of bitter grief
6150	Weighs heavy on my soul; till set of sun
6150	"Fasting will I remain, and still endure."""
6150	""
6150	The other monarchs at his word withdrew:
6150	The two Atridae, and Ulysses sage,
6150	And Nestor and Idomeneus remain'd,
6150	And aged Phoenix, to divert his grief;
6150	But comfort none, save in the bloody jaws
6150	Of battle would he take; by mem'ry stirr'd,
6150	He heav'd a deep-drawn sigh, as thus he spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""How oft hast thou, ill-fated, dearest friend,"
6150	Here in this tent with eager zeal prepar'd
6150	The tempting meal, whene'er the sons of Greece
6150	In haste would arm them for the bloody fray!
6150	Now liest thou there, while I, for love of thee,
6150	From food and drink, before me plac'd, refrain:
6150	For ne'er shall I again such sorrow know,
6150	Not though I heard of aged Peleus' death,
6150	Who now in Phthia mourns, with tender tears,
6150	His absent son; he on a foreign shore
6150	Is warring in that hateful Helen's cause:
6150	No, nor of his, who now in Scyros' isle
6150	Is growing up, if yet indeed he live,
6150	Young Neoptolemus, my godlike son.
6150	My hope had been indeed, that here in Troy,
6150	Far from the plains of Argos, I alone
6150	Was doom'd to die; and that to Phthia thou,
6150	Return'd in safety, mightst my son convey
6150	From Scyros home, and show him all my wealth,
6150	My spoils, my slaves, my lofty, spacious house.
6150	For Peleus or to death, methinks, e'en now
6150	Hath yielded, or not far from death remov'd,
6150	Lives on in sorrow, bow'd by gloomy age,
6150	Expecting day by day the messenger
6150	"Who bears the mournful tidings of my death."""
6150	""
6150	Weeping, Achilles spoke; and with him wept
6150	The Elders; each to fond remembrance mov'd
6150	Of all that in his home himself had left.
6150	The son of Saturn, pitying, saw their grief,
6150	And Pallas thus with winged words address'd:
6150	"""My child, dost thou a hero's cause forsake,"
6150	Or does Achilles claim no more thy care,
6150	Who sits in sorrow by the high-prow'd ships,
6150	Mourning his comrade slain? the others all
6150	Partake the meal, while he from food abstains:
6150	Then haste thee, and, with hunger lest he faint,
6150	"Drop nectar and ambrosia on his breast."""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh impulse gave to Pallas' zeal:
6150	Down, like the long-wing'd falcon, shrill of voice,
6150	Thro' the clear sky she swoop'd: and while the Greeks
6150	Arm'd for the fight, Achilles she approach'd,
6150	And nectar and ambrosia on his breast
6150	Distill'd, lest hunger should his strength subdue;
6150	Back to her mighty Father's ample house
6150	Returning, as from out the ships they pour'd.
6150	Thick as the snow-flakes that from Heav'n descend,
6150	Before the sky-born Boreas' chilling blast;
6150	So thick, outpouring from the ships, the stream
6150	Of helmets polish'd bright, and bossy shields,
6150	And breastplates firmly brac'd, and ashen spears:
6150	Their brightness flash'd to Heav'n; and laugh'd the Earth
6150	Beneath the brazen glare; loud rang the tramp
6150	Of armed men: Achilles in the midst,
6150	The godlike chief, in dazzling arms array'd.
6150	His teeth were gnashing audibly; his eye
6150	Blaz'd with, the light of fire; but in his heart
6150	Was grief unbearable; with furious wrath
6150	He burn'd against the Trojans, as he donn'd
6150	The heav'nly gifts, the work of Vulcan's hand.
6150	First on his legs the well-wrought greaves he fix'd,
6150	Fasten'd with silver clasps; his breastplate next
6150	Around his chest; and o'er his shoulders flung
6150	His silver-studded sword, with blade of brass;
6150	Then took his vast and weighty shield, whence gleam'd
6150	A light refulgent as the full-orb'd moon;
6150	Or as to seamen o'er the wave is borne
6150	The watchfire's light, which, high among the hills,
6150	Some shepherd kindles in his lonely fold:
6150	As they, reluctant, by the stormy winds,
6150	Far from their friends are o'er the waters driv'n;
6150	So from Achilles' shield, bright, richly wrought,
6150	The light was thrown. The weighty helm he rais'd,
6150	And plac'd it on his head; the plumed helm
6150	Shone like a star; and wav'd the hairs of gold.
6150	Thick-set by Vulcan in the gleaming crest.
6150	Then all the arms Achilles prov'd, to know
6150	If well they fitted to his graceful limbs:
6150	Like wings, they seem'd to lift him from the ground.
6150	Last, from its case he drew his father's spear,
6150	Long, pond'rous, tough; not one of all the Greeks,
6150	None, save Achilles' self, could poise that spear;
6150	The far-fam'd Pelian ash, which to his sire,
6150	On Pelion's summit fell'd, to be the bane
6150	Of mighty chiefs, the Centaur Chiron gave.
6150	With care Automedon and Alcimus
6150	The horses yok'd, with collars fair attach'd:
6150	Plac'd in their mouths the bits, and pass'd the reins
6150	Back to the well-built car: Automedon
6150	Sprang on the car, with shining lash in hand:
6150	Behind, Achilles came, array'd for war,
6150	In arms all glitt'ring as the gorgeous sun,
6150	And loudly to his father's steeds he call'd:
6150	"""Xanthus and Balius, noble progeny"
6150	Of swift Podarge, now in other sort
6150	Back to the Grecian ranks in safety bear,
6150	When he shall quit the field, your charioteer;
6150	"Nor leave him, as ye left Patroclus, slain."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer from beneath the yoke
6150	Xanthus, the noble horse, with glancing feet:
6150	Bowing his head the while, till all his mane
6150	Down from th' yokeband streaming, reach'd the ground;
6150	By Juno, white-arm'd Queen, with speech endued:
6150	""
6150	"""Yes, great Achilles, we this day again"
6150	Will bear thee safely; but thy day of doom
6150	Is nigh at hand; nor we shall cause thy death,
6150	But Heav'n's high will, and Fate's imperious pow'r.
6150	By no default of ours, nor lack of speed,
6150	The Trojans stripp'd Patroclus of his arms:
6150	The mighty God, fair-hair'd Latona's son,
6150	Achiev'd his death, and Hector's vict'ry gain'd.
6150	Our speed of foot may vie with Zephyr's breeze,
6150	Deem'd swiftest of the winds; but thou art doom'd
6150	"To die, by force combin'd of God and man."""
6150	""
6150	He said; his farther speech the Furies stay'd.
6150	To whom in wrath Achilles swift of foot;
6150	"""Xanthus, why thus predict my coming fate?"
6150	It ill beseems thee! well I know myself
6150	That I am fated here in Troy to die,
6150	Far from my home and parents; yet withal
6150	I cease not, till these Trojans from the field
6150	"Before me fly."" He said, and to the front,"
6150	His war-cry shouting, urg'd his fiery steeds.

6150	Round thee, Achilles, eager for the fray,
6150	Stood thus accoutred, by their beaked ships,
6150	The sons of Greece; the Trojan host, oppos'd,
6150	Stood on the sloping margin of the plain.
6150	Then Jove to Themis gave command to call
6150	The Gods to council from the lofty height
6150	Of many-ridg'd Olympus; to the house
6150	Of Jove she summon'd them from ev'ry side.
6150	Thence of the Rivers, save Oceanus,
6150	Not one was absent; nor of Nymphs, who haunt
6150	Clear fount, or shady grove, or grassy mead.
6150	They, at the Cloud-compeller's house arriv'd,
6150	Within the polish'd corridor reclin'd,

6150	There were they gather'd in th' abode of Jove:
6150	Nor did th' Earth-shaking Neptune slight the call,
6150	But came from ocean's depths, and in the midst
6150	He sat, and thus the will of Jove enquir'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Why, Lord of lightning, hast thou summon'd here"
6150	The Gods to council? dost thou aught devise
6150	Touching the Greeks and Trojans? who e'en now
6150	"Kindle anew, it seems, the blaze of war."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cloud-compeller, answ'ring, thus:
6150	"""The purpose, Neptune, well thou know'st thyself"
6150	For which I call'd ye; true, they needs must die,
6150	But still they claim my care; yet here will I
6150	Upon Olympus' lofty ridge remain,
6150	And view, serene, the combat; you, the rest,
6150	Go, as you list, to Trojans or to Greeks,
6150	And at your pleasure either party aid.
6150	For if we leave Achilles thus alone
6150	To fight against the Trojans, not an hour
6150	Will they before the son of Peleus stand.
6150	They dreaded him before; but now, I fear,
6150	Since rous'd to fury by his comrade's death,
6150	"He e'en in fate's despite may storm the wall."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Saturn's son, and quenchless battle rous'd:
6150	The Gods, divided, hasten'd to the war:
6150	Juno and Pallas to the ships of Greece,
6150	With them th' Earth-shaker, and the helpful God,
6150	Hermes, for cunning subtleties unmatch'd;
6150	And Vulcan too, exulting in his strength,
6150	Yet halting, and on feeble limbs sustain'd.
6150	Mars of the glancing helm took part with Troy,
6150	And golden Phoebus with his locks unshorn,
6150	Latona too, and Dian, Archer-Queen,
6150	Xanthus, and Venus, laughter-loving dame.
6150	""
6150	While from the fight of men the Gods abstain'd,
6150	High rose the Grecian vaunts, as, long withdrawn,
6150	Achilles on the field again appear'd:
6150	And ev'ry Trojan's limbs with terror quak'd,
6150	Trembling, as Peleus' godlike son they saw,
6150	In arms all-glitt'ring, fierce as blood-stain'd Mars.
6150	But when th' Immortals mingled in the throng,
6150	Then furious wax'd the spirit-stirring strife;
6150	Then Pallas rais'd her war-cry, standing now
6150	Beside the deep-dug trench, without the wall,
6150	Now shouting loud along the sounding beach.
6150	On th' other side, as with the tempest's roar,
6150	Mars to the Trojans shouted loud; one while
6150	From Ilium's topmost height; anon again
6150	From the fair hill, o'erhanging Simois' stream.
6150	Thus, either side exciting to the fray,
6150	Th' immortal Gods unchain'd the angry war.
6150	Thunder'd on high the Sire of Gods and men
6150	With awful din; while Neptune shook beneath
6150	The boundless earth, and lofty mountain tops.
6150	The spring-abounding Ida quak'd and rock'd
6150	From her firm basis to her loftiest peak,
6150	And Troy's proud city, and the ships of Greece.
6150	Pluto, th' infernal monarch, heard alarm'd,
6150	And, springing from his throne, cried out in fear,
6150	Lest Neptune, breaking through the solid earth,
6150	To mortals and Immortals should lay bare
6150	His dark and drear abode, of Gods abhorr'd.
6150	Such was the shock when Gods in battle met;
6150	For there to royal Neptune stood oppos'd
6150	Phoebus Apollo with his arrows keen;
6150	The blue-ey'd Pallas to the God of War;
6150	To Juno, Dian, heav'nly Archeress,
6150	Sister of Phoebus, golden-shafted Queen.
6150	Stout Hermes, helpful God, Latona fac'd;
6150	While Vulcan met the mighty rolling stream,
6150	Xanthus by Gods, by men Scamander call'd.
6150	Thus Gods encounter'd Gods: Achilles' soul
6150	Meantime was burning 'mid the throng to meet
6150	Hector, the son of Priam; with whose blood
6150	He long'd to glut th' insatiate Lord of War.
6150	Apollo then, the spirit-stirring God,
6150	AEneas mov'd Achilles to confront,
6150	And fill'd with courage high; and thus, the voice
6150	Assuming of Lycaon, Priam's son,
6150	Apollo, son of Jove, the chief address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""AEneas, prince and councillor of Troy,"
6150	Where are the vaunts, which o'er the wine-cup late
6150	Thou mad'st amid th' assembled chiefs of Troy,
6150	"That hand to hand thou wouldst Achilles meet?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom AEneas thus in answer spoke:
6150	"""Why, son of Priam, urge me to contend,"
6150	Against my will, with Peleus' mighty son?
6150	Not for the first time should I now engage
6150	Achilles swift of foot: I met him once,
6150	And fled before his spear, on Ida's hill,
6150	When on our herds he fell; Lyrnessus then
6150	He raz'd, and Pedasus; me Jove preserv'd,
6150	With strength, endowing, and with speed of foot.
6150	Else had I fall'n beneath Achilles' hand,
6150	By Pallas aided; who before him moves,
6150	Light of his life, and guides his brazen spear
6150	Trojans and Leleges alike to slay.
6150	'Tis not in mortal man with him to fight,
6150	Whom still some God attends, and guards from harm;
6150	And, e'en unaided, to the mark his spear
6150	Unerring flies, uncheck'd until it pierce
6150	A warrior's breast; yet if the Gods the scale
6150	Impartial held, all brass-clad as he is,
6150	"O'er me no easy triumph should he gain."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the King Apollo, son of Jove:
6150	"""Brave chief, do thou too to th' immortal Gods"
6150	Address thy pray'r; men say that thou art sprung
6150	From Venus, child of Jove; his mother owns
6150	A humbler origin; one born to Jove,
6150	The other to the aged Ocean God.
6150	On then with dauntless spear, nor be dismay'd
6150	"By his high tone and vaunting menaces."""
6150	""
6150	His words with courage fill'd the hero's breast,
6150	And on he sprang, in dazzling arms arrayed;
6150	But not unmark'd of white-arm'd Juno pass'd,
6150	To meet Achilles, through the press of men,
6150	Who thus address'd the Gods, to council call'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Neptune and Pallas both, bethink ye well"
6150	What now should be our course; AEneas comes,
6150	In dazzling arms array'd, to meet in fight
6150	The son of Peleus; Phoebus sends him forth.
6150	Say, then, shall we, encount'ring, to retreat
6150	Perforce constrain him? or shall one of us
6150	Beside Achilles stand, and give him strength
6150	That he may nothing lack; and know himself
6150	By all the mightiest of th' immortal Gods
6150	Belov'd, and those how pow'rless, by whose aid
6150	The Trojans yet maintain defensive war?
6150	Therefore, to join the battle, came we all
6150	From high Olympus, that in this day's fight
6150	No ill befall him; though the time shall come
6150	For him to meet the doom, by fate decreed,
6150	When at his birth his thread of life was spun.
6150	But if Achilles from a voice divine
6150	Receive not this assurance, he may well
6150	Be struck with fear, if haply to some God
6150	He find himself oppos'd: 'tis hard for man
6150	"To meet, in presence visible, a God."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Earth-shaking Neptune thus replied:
6150	"""Juno, thine anger carry not too far;"
6150	It ill beseems thee. Not with my consent
6150	Shall we, the stronger far, provoke to arms
6150	The other Gods; but rather, from the field
6150	Retiring, let us from on high survey,
6150	To mortals left, the turmoil of the war.
6150	Should Mars or Phoebus then begin the fight,
6150	Or stay Achilles, and his arm restrain,
6150	Then in the contest we too may engage;
6150	And soon, methinks, will they be fain to join,
6150	Driv'n from the field, the Synod of the Gods,
6150	"Subdued perforce by our victorious hands."""
6150	""
6150	The dark-hair'd monarch spoke; and led the way
6150	To the high wall, by Trojans built of old,
6150	With Pallas' aid, for godlike Hercules;
6150	Within whose circle he might safety seek,
6150	When from the beach the monster of the deep
6150	Might chase him toward the plain; there Neptune sat,
6150	And with him, the other Gods, a veil of cloud
6150	Impenetrable around their shoulders spread.
6150	On th' other side, upon the fair hill's brow,
6150	Phoebus with Mars the fort-destroyer sat.
6150	On either side they sat, each facing each
6150	With hostile counsels; yet reluctant both
6150	To take th' initiative of ruthless war;
6150	Till Jove, enthron'd on high, the signal gave.
6150	Then all the plain, with men and horses throng'd,
6150	The brazen gleam illumin'd; rang the earth
6150	Beneath their feet, as to the battle-shock
6150	They rush'd; but in the midst, both hosts between,
6150	Eager for fight, stood forth two warriors bold,
6150	Proudly pre-eminent; Anchises' son
6150	AEneas, and Achilles' godlike might.
6150	""
6150	AEneas first with threat'ning mien advanc'd,
6150	Nodding his pond'rous helm; before his breast
6150	His shield he bore, and pois'd his brazen spear.
6150	Him met Achilles from th' opposing ranks;
6150	Fierce as a rav'ning lion, whom to slay
6150	Pour forth the stalwart youths, th' united strength
6150	Of the rous'd village; he unheeding moves
6150	At first; but wounded by a jav'lin thrown
6150	By some bold youth, he turns, with gaping jaws,
6150	And frothing fangs, collecting for the spring,
6150	His breast too narrow for his mighty heart;
6150	And with his tail he lashes both his flanks
6150	And sides, as though to rouse his utmost rage;
6150	Then on, in pride of strength, with glaring eyes
6150	He dashes, if some hunter he may slay,
6150	Or in the foremost rank himself be slain.
6150	So mov'd his dauntless spirit Peleus' son
6150	AEneas to confront; when near they came,
6150	Thus first Achilles, swift of foot, began:
6150	""
6150	"""AEneas, why so far before the ranks"
6150	Advanc'd? dost thou presume with me to fight?
6150	Perchance expecting that the throne of Troy
6150	And Priam's royal honours may be thine.
6150	E'en if thou slay me, deem not to obtain
6150	Such boon from Priam; valiant sons are his,
6150	And he not weak, but bears a constant mind.
6150	Or have the Trojans set apart for thee
6150	Some favour'd spot, the fairest of the land,
6150	Orchard or corn-land, shouldst thou work my death;
6150	Which thou shalt find, I trust, too hard a task?
6150	Already hast thou fled before my spear;
6150	Hast thou forgotten how amid thy herds
6150	Alone I found thee, and with flying foot
6150	Pursued thee down the steep of Ida's hill?
6150	Nor didst thou dare to turn, or pause in flight.
6150	Thou to Lyrnessus fledd'st; Lyrnessus I,
6150	With Pallas' aid and Jove's, assail'd and took:
6150	Their women thence, their days of freedom lost,
6150	I bore away, my captives; thee from death,
6150	Jove and the other Gods defended then;
6150	But will not now bestow, though such thy hope,
6150	Their succour; then I warn thee, while 'tis time,
6150	Ere ill betide thee, to the gen'ral throng
6150	That thou withdraw, nor stand to me oppos'd:
6150	"After th' event may e'en a fool be wise."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer thus AEneas spoke:
6150	"""Achilles, think not me, as though a fool,"
6150	To daunt with lofty speech; I too could well
6150	With cutting words, and insult, answer thee.
6150	Each other's race and parents well we know
6150	From tales of ancient days; although by sight
6150	Nor mine to thee, nor thine to me are known.
6150	To noble Peleus thou, 'tis said, wast born
6150	Of Thetis, fair-hair'd daughter of the sea;
6150	Of great Anchises, Heav'n-descended chief,
6150	I boast me sprung, to him by Venus borne.
6150	Of these shall one or other have this day
6150	To mourn their son; since not with empty words
6150	Shall thou and I from mortal combat part.
6150	But if thou farther wouldst enquire, and learn
6150	The race I spring from, not unknown to men,
6150	By Dardanus, of cloud-compelling Jove
6150	Begotten, was Dardania peopled first,
6150	Ere sacred Ilium, populous city of men,
6150	Was founded on the plain; as yet they dwelt
6150	On spring-abounding Ida's lowest spurs.
6150	To Dardanus was Erichthonius born,
6150	Great King, the wealthiest of the sons of men;
6150	For him were pastur'd in the marshy mead,
6150	Rejoicing with their foals, three thousand mares;
6150	Them Boreas, in the pasture where they fed,
6150	Beheld, enamour'd; and amid the herd
6150	In likeness of a coal-black steed appear'd;
6150	Twelve foals, by him conceiving, they produc'd.
6150	These, o'er the teeming corn-fields as they flew,
6150	Skimm'd o'er the standing ears, nor broke the haulm;
6150	And, o'er wide Ocean's bosom as they flew,
6150	Skimm'd o'er the topmost spray of th' hoary sea
6150	Again, to Erichthonius Tros was born,
6150	The King of Troy; three noble sons were his,
6150	Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede;
6150	The fairest he of all the sons of men;
6150	Him, for his beauty, bore the Gods away,
6150	To minister as cup-bearer to Jove,
6150	And dwell amid th' Immortals: Ilus next
6150	Begot a noble son, Laomedon;
6150	Tithonus he, and Priam; Clytius,
6150	Lampus and Icetaon, plant of Mars;
6150	Capys, begotten of Assaracus,
6150	Begot Anchises, and Anchises me:
6150	To Priam godlike Hector owes his birth.
6150	Such is my race, and such the blood I boast;
6150	But Jove, at will, to mortals valour gives
6150	Or minishes; for he is Lord of all.
6150	Then cease we now, like babbling fools, to prate
6150	Here in the centre of the coming fight.
6150	Terms of reproach we both might find, whose weight
6150	Would sink a galley of a hundred oars;
6150	For glibly runs the tongue, and can at will
6150	Give utt'rance to discourse in ev'ry vein;
6150	Wide is the range of language; and such words
6150	As one may speak, another may return.
6150	What need that we should insults interchange?
6150	Like women, who some paltry quarrel wage,
6150	Scolding and brawling in the public street,
6150	And in opprobrious terms their anger vent,
6150	Some true, some false; for so their rage suggests.
6150	With words thou shalt not turn me from the field,
6150	Till we have met in arms; then try we now
6150	"Each other's prowess with our brazen spears."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and hurl'd against the mighty shield
6150	His brazen spear; loud rang the weapon's point;
6150	And at arm's length Achilles held the shield
6150	With his broad hand, in fear that through its folds
6150	AEneas' spear would easy passage find;
6150	Blind fool! forgetful that the glorious gifts
6150	Bestow'd by Gods, are not with ease o'ercome,
6150	Nor yield before th' assaults of mortal men.
6150	""
6150	So broke not through AEneas' sturdy spear,
6150	Stay'd by the golden plate, the gift of Heav'n;
6150	Yet through two plates it pass'd, but three remain'd,
6150	For five were in the shield by Vulcan wrought;
6150	Two were of brass, the inner two of tin,
6150	And one of gold, which stay'd the brazen spear.
6150	""
6150	Achilles threw in turn his pond'rous spear.
6150	And struck the circle of AEneas' shield
6150	Near the first rim, where thinnest lay the brass,
6150	And thinnest too th' o'erlying hide; right through
6150	The Pelian shaft was driv'n; wide gap'd the shield.
6150	AEneas crouch'd, in fear, as o'er his head
6150	He held his shield; the eager weapon pass'd
6150	Through both the circles of his ample shield,
6150	And in the ground, behind him, quiv'ring, stood.
6150	Escap'd the pond'rous weapon, sharpest pain
6150	Flashing across his eyes, in fear he stood,
6150	So close the spear had pass'd him; onward then,
6150	Drawing his trenchant blade, Achilles rush'd,
6150	With fearful shout; a rocky fragment then
6150	AEneas lifted up, a mighty mass,
6150	Which scarce two men, as men are now, could bear,
6150	But he, unaided, lifted it with ease.
6150	Then had AEneas, with the massive stone,
6150	Or on the helmet, or the shield, his death
6150	Averting, struck Achilles; and himself
6150	Had by the sword of Peleus' son been slain,
6150	Had not th' Earth-shaking God his peril seen,
6150	And to th' Immortals thus address'd his speech:
6150	"""Oh, woe is me for great AEneas' sake,"
6150	Who, by Achilles slain, must visit soon
6150	The viewless shades; insensate, who relied
6150	On Phoebus' words; yet nought shall he avail
6150	From death to save him. Yet oh why should he,
6150	Blameless himself, the guilt of others rue?
6150	Who still his grateful sacrifice hath paid
6150	To all the Gods in wide-spread Heav'n who dwell.
6150	Let us then interpose to guard his life;
6150	Lest, if Achilles slay him, Saturn's son
6150	Be mov'd to anger; for his destiny
6150	Would have him live; lest, heirless, from the earth
6150	Should perish quite the race of Dardanus;
6150	By Saturn's son the best-belov'd of all
6150	His sons, to him by mortal women born.
6150	For Jove the race of Priam hath abhorr'd;
6150	But o'er the Trojans shall AEneas reign,
6150	"And his sons' sons, through ages yet unborn."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the stag-ey'd Queen of Heav'n:
6150	"""Neptune, do thou determine for thyself"
6150	AEneas to withdraw, or leave to fall,
6150	Good as he is, beneath Achilles' sword;
6150	But we before th' immortal Gods are bound,
6150	Both I and Pallas, by repeated oaths,
6150	Ne'er from his doom one Trojan life to save,
6150	Though to devouring flames a prey, all Troy
6150	"Were blazing, kindled by the valiant Greeks."""
6150	""
6150	Th' Earth-shaker heard; and thro' the fight he pass'd,
6150	And through the throng of spears, until he came
6150	Where great Achilles and AEneas stood.
6150	Around the eyes of Peleus' son he spread
6150	A veil of mist; then from AEneas' shield
6150	The brass-tipp'd spear withdrawing, laid it down
6150	Before Achilles' feet; and lifting up
6150	AEneas, bore him high above the ground.
6150	O'er many a rank of warriors and of cars
6150	AEneas flew, supported by the God;
6150	Till to the field's extremest verge he came,
6150	Where stood the Caucons, arming for the war.
6150	There to AEneas, standing by his side,
6150	Th' Earth-shaker thus his winged words address'd:
6150	"""AEneas, say what God has mov'd thee thus"
6150	Against Achilles, reckless, to contend,
6150	Thy stronger far, and dearer to the Gods?
6150	If e'er he cross thy path, do thou retire,
6150	Lest, e'en despite of fate, thou find thy death.
6150	But when Achilles hath to fate succumb'd,
6150	Then, fearless, with the foremost join the fray:
6150	"No other Greek shall bear away thy spoils."""
6150	""
6150	Thus plainly warn'd, AEneas there he left.
6150	Then from Achilles' eyes he purg'd the film:
6150	Astonish'd, he with eyes wide open gaz'd,
6150	As thus he commun'd with his mighty heart:
6150	""
6150	"""O Heav'n, what marvel do mine eyes behold?"
6150	My spear before me laid, and vanish'd he
6150	At whom I hurl'd it with intent to slay!
6150	Then is AEneas of th' immortal Gods
6150	In truth belov'd, though vain I deem'd his boast.
6150	A curse go with him! yet methinks not soon
6150	Will he again presume to prove my might,
6150	Who gladly now in flight escapes from death.
6150	Then, to the valiant Greeks my orders giv'n.
6150	"Let me some other Trojan's mettle prove."""
6150	Then tow'rd the ranks he sprang, each sev'ral man
6150	"Exhorting: ""From the Trojans, valiant Greeks,"
6150	No longer stand aloof; but man to man
6150	Confront the foe, and nobly dare the fight.
6150	'Twere hard for me, brave warrior though I be,
6150	To face such numbers, and to fight with all:
6150	Not Mars, nor Pallas, though immortal Gods,
6150	Could face, and vanquish, such a mighty mass.
6150	But what my single arm, and feet, and strength
6150	May profit, not a jot will I relax;
6150	Right through the ranks I mean to force my way;
6150	And small shall be that Trojan's cause for joy,
6150	"Who comes within the compass of my spear."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he, exhorting; Hector cheering on
6150	Meanwhile the Trojans, with assurance giv'n
6150	That he himself Achilles would confront.
6150	""
6150	"""Ye valiant Trojans, fear not Peleus' son;"
6150	I too in words could with the Gods contend,
6150	Though not in arms; so much the stronger they.
6150	Not all his words Achilles shall make good;
6150	Fulfilling some, in others he shall fail,
6150	His course midway arrested. Him will I
6150	Encounter, though his hands were hands of fire,
6150	"Of fire his hands, his strength as burnish'd steel."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he, exhorting; with uplifted spears
6150	Advanc'd the Trojans; from the mingling hosts
6150	Loud rose the clamour; then at Hector's side
6150	Apollo stood, and thus address'd the chief:
6150	"""Hector, forbear Achilles to defy;"
6150	And 'mid the crowd withdraw thee from the fray;
6150	Lest with the spear he slay thee, thrown from far,
6150	"Or with the sword in combat hand to hand."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and troubled by the heav'nly voice,
6150	Hector amid the throng of men withdrew.
6150	""
6150	Then, girt with might, amid the Trojans sprang,
6150	With fearful shouts, Achilles; first he slew
6150	Otryntes' son, Iphition, valiant chief
6150	Of num'rous warriors; him a Naiad nymph,
6150	In Hyde's fertile vale, beneath the feet
6150	Of snow-clad Tmolus, to Otryntes bore;
6150	At him, as on he rush'd, Achilles hurl'd,
6150	And through his forehead drove his glitt'ring spear;
6150	The head was cleft in twain; thund'ring he fell,
6150	And o'er him thus Achilles made his boast:
6150	""
6150	"""Son of Otryntes, lie thou there, of men"
6150	The most vain-glorious; here thou find'st thy death,
6150	Far from thy place of birth, beside the lake
6150	Gygaean; there hadst thou thine heritage
6150	Of old, beside the fish-abounding stream
6150	"Of Hyllus, and by Hermus' eddying flood."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he, exulting: o'er Iphition's eyes
6150	Were spread the shades of death; his mangled corpse
6150	Was crush'd beneath the Grecian chariot wheels,
6150	In the first shock. Demoleon next he smote,
6150	A helpful aid in war, Antenor's son,
6150	Pierc'd thro' the temples, thro' the brass-bound helm;
6150	Nor check'd the brazen helm the spear, whose point
6150	Went crashing through the bone, that all the brain
6150	Was shatter'd; onward as he rush'd, he fell.
6150	Then through the neck Hippodamas he smote,
6150	Flying before him, mounted on his car.
6150	Deep groan'd he, breathing out his soul, as groans
6150	A bull, by sturdy youths to th' altar dragg'd
6150	Of Neptune, King divine of Helice;
6150	Th' Earth-shaking God, well pleas'd, the gift receives;
6150	E'en with such groans his noble spirit fled.
6150	The godlike Polydore he next assail'd,
6150	The son of Priam; him his aged sire
6150	Would fain have kept at home, of all his sons
6150	At once the youngest and the best-belov'd;
6150	Among them all for speed of foot unmatch'd;
6150	Whose youthful folly, in the foremost ranks
6150	His speed displaying, cost him now his life.
6150	Him, as he darted by, Achilles' spear
6150	Struck through the centre of the back, where met
6150	The golden clasps that held the glitt'ring belt,
6150	And where the breastplate form'd a double guard:
6150	Right through his body pass'd the weapon's point;
6150	Groaning, he fell upon his knees; dark clouds
6150	O'erspread his eyes; supporting with his hand
6150	His wounded bowels, on the ground he writh'd.
6150	When Hector saw his brother Polydore
6150	Writhing in death, a mist o'erspread his eyes
6150	Nor longer could he bear to stand aloof,
6150	But sprang to meet Achilles, flashing fire,
6150	His keen spear brandishing; at sight of him
6150	Up leap'd Achilles, and exulting cried:
6150	""
6150	"""Lo, here the man who most hath wrung my soul,"
6150	Who slew my lov'd companion: now, methinks,
6150	Upon the pass of war not long shall we
6150	"Stand separate, nor each the other shun."""
6150	""
6150	Then, with stern glance, to godlike Hector thus:
6150	"""Draw near, and quickly meet thy doom of death."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm,
6150	"Unterrified: ""Achilles, think not me,"
6150	As though a fool and ignorant of war,
6150	To daunt with lofty speech; I too could well
6150	With cutting words and insult answer thee.
6150	I know thee strong and valiant; and I know
6150	Myself to thee inferior; but th' event
6150	Is with the Gods; and I, if such their will,
6150	The weaker, with my spear may reach thy life:
6150	"My point too hath, ere now, its sharpness prov'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and, poising, hurl'd his pond'rous spear,
6150	Which from Achilles Pallas turn'd aside
6150	With lightest breath; and back to Hector sent,
6150	And laid before his feet; intent to slay,
6150	Onward Achilles rush'd, with fearful shout;
6150	But Phoebus Hector from the field convey'd,
6150	(As Gods can only,) veil'd in thickest cloud.
6150	Thrice Peleus' godlike son, with brazen spear,
6150	His onset made; thrice struck the misty cloud;
6150	But when, with pow'r as of a God, he made
6150	His fourth essay, in fury thus he cried:
6150	""
6150	"""Yet once again, vile hound, hast thou escap'd;"
6150	Thy doom was nigh, but thee thy God hath sav'd,
6150	Phoebus, to whom, amid the clash of spears,
6150	Well mayst thou pray! We yet shall meet again;
6150	When I shall end thee, if a guardian God
6150	I too may claim; meanwhile, from thee I turn,
6150	"And others seek on whom my hap may light."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and drove through Dryops' neck his spear,
6150	And stretch'd him at his feet, and pass'd him by.
6150	Next with his spear he struck below the knee
6150	Philetor's son, Demuchus, stout and tall,
6150	And check'd his forward course; then rushing on
6150	Dealt with his mighty sword the mortal blow.
6150	The sons of Bias next, Laogonus
6150	And Dardanus, he hurl'd from off their car,
6150	One with the spear, and one by sword-stroke slain.
6150	Tros too he slew, Alastor's son, who came
6150	To meet him, and embrace his knees, and pray
6150	To spare his life, in pity of his youth:
6150	Little he knew how vain would be his pray'r;
6150	For not of temper soft, nor mild of mood
6150	Was he, but sternly fierce; and as he knelt
6150	And clasp'd his knees, and would his pray'r prefer,
6150	Achilles clove him with his mighty sword,
6150	Gash'd through the liver; as from out the wound
6150	His liver dropp'd, the dark blood gushing forth
6150	His bosom fill'd, and darkness clos'd his eyes,
6150	As ebb'd his life away. Then through the ear
6150	Mulius he thrust; at th' other ear came forth
6150	The brazen point. Echeclus next he met,
6150	Son of Agenor, and his hilted sword
6150	Full on the centre of his head let fall.
6150	The hot blood dy'd the blade; the darkling shades
6150	Of death, and rig'rous fate, his eyes o'erspread.
6150	Next, where the tendons bind the elbow-joint,
6150	The brazen spear transfix'd Deucalion's arm;
6150	With death in prospect, and disabled arm
6150	He stood, till on his neck Achilles' sword
6150	Descending, shar'd, and flung afar, both head
6150	And helmet; from the spine's dissever'd joints
6150	The marrow flow'd, as stretch'd in dust he lay.
6150	The noble son of Peireus next he slew,
6150	Rigmus, who came from Thracia's fertile plains;
6150	Him through the waist he struck, the brazen spear
6150	Plung'd in his bowels; from the car he fell;
6150	And as Areithous, his charioteer,
6150	His horses turn'd, Achilles through the neck
6150	His sharp spear thrusting, hurl'd him to the ground,
6150	The startled steeds in wild confusion thrown.
6150	""
6150	As rage the fires amid the wooded glen
6150	Of some parch'd mountain's side, and fiercely burns
6150	The copse-wood dry, while eddying here and there
6150	The flames are whirl'd before the gusty wind;
6150	So fierce Achilles raged, on ev'ry side
6150	Pursuing, slaught'ring; reek'd the earth with blood.
6150	As when upon a well-roll'd threshing-floor,
6150	Two sturdy-fronted steers, together yok'd,
6150	Tread the white barley out; beneath their feet
6150	Fast flies the grain out-trodden from the husk;
6150	So by Achilles driv'n, his flying steeds
6150	His chariot bore, o'er bodies of the slain
6150	And broken bucklers trampling; all beneath
6150	Was plash'd with blood the axle, and the rails
6150	Around the car, as from the horses' feet
6150	And from the felloes of the wheels were thrown
6150	The bloody gouts; and onward still he press'd,
6150	Panting for added triumphs, deeply dyed
6150	With gore and carnage his unconquer'd hands.

6150	THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the
6150	river Scamander; he falls upon the latter with great slaughter, takes
6150	twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and
6150	kills Lycaon and Asteropaeus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves;
6150	Neptune and Pallas assist the hero; Simois joins Scamander; at length
6150	Vulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This
6150	combat ended, the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles
6150	continues the slaughter, and drives the rest into Troy; Agenor only
6150	makes a stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo: who (to
6150	delude Achilles) takes upon him Agenor's shape, and while he pursues
6150	him in that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into
6150	their city.

6150	The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of

6150	BOOK XXI.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	But when they came to eddying Xanthus' ford,
6150	Fair-flowing stream, born of immortal Jove,
6150	Achilles cut in twain the flying host;
6150	Part driving tow'rd the city, o'er the plain,
6150	Where on the former day the routed Greeks,
6150	When Hector rag'd victorious, fled amain.
6150	On, terror-struck, they rush'd; but Juno spread,
6150	To baffle their retreat, before their path,
6150	Clouds and thick darkness: half the fugitives
6150	In the deep river's silv'ry eddies plung'd:
6150	With clamour loud they fell: the torrent roar'd;
6150	The banks around re-echoed; here and there,
6150	They, with the eddies wildly struggling, swam.
6150	As when, pursued by fire, a hov'ring swarm
6150	Of locusts riverward direct their flight,
6150	And, as th' insatiate flames advance, they cow'r
6150	Amid the waters; so a mingled mass
6150	Of men and horses, by Achilles driv'n,
6150	The deeply-whirling stream, of Xanthus chok'd.
6150	His spear amid the tamarisks on the bank
6150	The hero left; on savage deeds intent,
6150	Arm'd with his sword alone, a God in pow'r,
6150	He sprang amid the torrent; right and left
6150	He smote; then fearful rose the groans of men
6150	Slain with the sword; the stream ran red with blood.
6150	As fishes, flying from a dolphin, crowd
6150	The shoal recesses of some open bay,
6150	In fear, for whom he catches he devours;
6150	So crouch'd the Trojans in the mighty stream
6150	Beneath the banks; and when at length his hand
6150	Wearied of slaughter, from the stream, alive,
6150	He dragg'd twelve youths, whose forfeit lives should be
6150	The bloody fine for slain Patroclus paid.
6150	Helpless from fear, as fawns, he brought them forth;
6150	Their hands secur'd behind them with the belts
6150	Which o'er their shirts of twisted mail they wore,
6150	And bade his comrades lead them to the ships.
6150	Then on again he dash'd, athirst for blood;
6150	And first encounter'd, flying from the stream,
6150	Lycaon, Priam's son; him once before
6150	He by a nightly onslaught had surpris'd,
6150	And from his father's vineyard captive borne:
6150	Where, as he cut, to form his chariot rail,
6150	A fig-tree's tender shoots, unlook'd-for ill
6150	O'ertook him in the form of Peleus' son.
6150	Thence in his ship to Lemnos' thriving isle
6150	He bore him, ransom'd there by Jason's son.
6150	His Imbrian host, Eetion, set him free
6150	With lib'ral gifts, and to Arisba sent:
6150	Escaping thence, he reach'd his native home.
6150	Twelve days save one, rejoicing, with his friends
6150	He spent, return'd from Lemnos: fate, the twelfth,
6150	Again consign'd him to Achilles' hands,
6150	From him, reluctant, to receive his death.
6150	Him when Achilles, swift of foot, beheld,
6150	No spear in hand, of helm and shield bereft,
6150	All flung in haste away, as from the stream,
6150	Reeking with sweat, and faint with toil, he fled,
6150	He commun'd, wrathful, with his mighty heart:
6150	""
6150	"""Ye Gods, what marvel do mine eyes behold!"
6150	Methinks the valiant Trojans slain by me
6150	Ere long will from the realms of darkness rise;
6150	Since, death escaping, but to slav'ry sold
6150	In Lemnos' isle, this fellow hath return'd,
6150	Despite the hoary sea's impediment,
6150	Which many a man against his will hath stay'd:
6150	Now shall he taste my spear, that I may see
6150	If thence too he return, or if the earth
6150	"May keep him safe, which e'en the strongest holds."""
6150	""
6150	Thus, as he stood, he mus'd; but all aghast
6150	Approach'd Lycaon; and would fain have clasp'd
6150	The Hero's knees; for longingly he sought
6150	Escape from bitter death and evil fate.
6150	Achilles rais'd his spear, in act to strike;
6150	He, stooping, ran beneath, and clasp'd his knees;
6150	Above his back the murd'rous weapon pass'd,
6150	And in the earth was fix'd: one suppliant hand
6150	Achilles' knees embrac'd; the other held,
6150	With unrelaxing grasp, the pointed spear;
6150	As he with winged words, imploring, spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""I clasp thy knees, Achilles! look then down"
6150	With pity on my woes; and recognize,
6150	Illustrious chief, a suppliant's sacred claim:
6150	For in thy tent I first broke bread, that day,
6150	When, in my father's fruitful vineyard seiz'd,
6150	Thy captive I became, to slav'ry sold,
6150	Far from my sire and friends, in Lemnos' isle.
6150	A hundred oxen were my ransom then;
6150	At thrice so much I now would buy my life.
6150	This day is but the twelfth, since, sorely tried
6150	By lengthen'd suffering, back to Troy I came.
6150	Now to thy hands once more my cruel fate
6150	Consigns me; surely by the wrath of Jove
6150	Pursued, who gives me to thy pow'r again.
6150	Me, doom'd to early death, my mother bore,
6150	Old Altes' daughter, fair Laothoe;
6150	Altes, who rul'd the warlike Leleges,
6150	In lofty Pedasus, by Satnois' stream.
6150	His child of Priam's many wives was one;
6150	Two sons she bore, and both by thee must die.
6150	Already one, the godlike Polydore,
6150	Amid the foremost ranks thy spear hath slain;
6150	And now my doom hath found me; for from thee,
6150	Since evil fate hath plac'd me in thy hands,
6150	I may not hope to fly; yet hear but this,
6150	And weigh it in thy mind, to spare my life:
6150	I come not of that womb which Hector bore,
6150	"Who slew thy comrade, gentle, kind, and brave."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Priam's noble son, imploring, spoke;
6150	But stern the answer fell upon his ear:
6150	""
6150	"""Thou fool! no more to me of ransom prate!"
6150	Before Patroclus met the doom of death,
6150	To spare the Trojans still my soul inclin'd;
6150	And many captives, ta'en alive, I sold;
6150	But from henceforth, before the walls of Troy,
6150	Not one of all the Trojans, whom the Gods
6150	May to my hands deliver, least of all
6150	A son of Priam, shall escape the death.
6150	Thou too, my friend, must die: why vainly wail?
6150	Dead is Patroclus too, thy better far.
6150	Me too thou see'st, how stalwart, tall, and fair,
6150	Of noble sire, and Goddess-mother born:
6150	Yet must I yield to death and stubborn fate,
6150	Whene'er, at morn, or noon, or eve, the spear
6150	"Or arrow from the bow may reach my life."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and sank Lycaon's limbs and heart;
6150	He loos'd the spear, and sat, with both his hands
6150	Uprais'd, imploring; but Achilles drew,
6150	And on his neck beside the collar-bone
6150	Let fall his trenchant sword; the two-edg'd blade
6150	Was buried deep; prone on the earth he lay;
6150	Forth gush'd the crimson blood, and dyed the ground.
6150	""
6150	Him, dragging by the feet, Achilles threw
6150	In the mid stream, and thus with vaunting speech:
6150	""
6150	"""Lie there amid the fishes, who shall cleanse,"
6150	But not with kindly thought, thy gory wounds:
6150	O'er thee, extended on thy bier, shall rise
6150	No mother's wail; Scamander's eddying stream
6150	Shall to the sea's broad bosom roll thee down;
6150	And, springing through the darkly rippling wave,
6150	Fishes shall rise, and banquet on thy flesh.
6150	On now the work of death! till, flying ye,
6150	And slaught'ring I, we reach the city wall.
6150	Nor this fair-flowing, silver-eddying stream,
6150	Shall aught avail ye, though to him ye pay
6150	In sacrifice the blood of countless bulls,
6150	And living horses in his waters sink.
6150	Ye all shall perish, till Patroclus' death
6150	Be fully aveng'd, and slaughter of the Greeks,
6150	"Whom, in my absence, by the ships ye slew."""
6150	He said: the mighty River at his words
6150	Indignant chaf'd, and ponder'd in his mind
6150	How best to check Achilles' warlike toil,
6150	And from destruction guard the Trojan host.
6150	""
6150	Meantime Achilles with his pond'rous spear
6150	Asteropaeus, son of Pelegon,
6150	Assail'd with deadly purpose; Pelegon
6150	To broadly-flowing Axius ow'd his birth,
6150	The River-God commingling with the blood
6150	Of Periboea, daughter eldest born
6150	Of Acessamenus: on him he sprang;
6150	He, from the river rising, stood oppos'd.
6150	Two lances in his hand; his courage rous'd
6150	By Xanthus, who, indignant, saw his stream
6150	Polluted by the blood of slaughter'd youths,
6150	By fierce Achilles' hand, unpitying, slain.
6150	When near the warriors, each to other, came,
6150	Achilles, swift of foot, took up the word:
6150	"""What man, and whence art thou, who dar'st to stand"
6150	Oppos'd to me? of most unhappy sires
6150	"The children they, who my encounter meet!"""
6150	""
6150	To whom th' illustrious son of Pelegon:
6150	"""Great son of Peleus, why enquire my race?"
6150	From far Paeonia's fertile fields I come,
6150	The leader of the long-spear'd Paeon host.
6150	Ten days have pass'd since I to Ilium came.
6150	From widely-flowing Axius my descent,
6150	Axius, the purest stream on earth that flows.
6150	He Pelegon begot, the spear-renown'd;
6150	Of Pelegon I boast me sprung; and now
6150	"Address thee, brave Achilles, to the fight."""
6150	""
6150	Threat'ning he spoke: Achilles rais'd on high
6150	The Pelian spear; but, ambidexter, he
6150	From either hand at once a jav'lin launch'd.
6150	One struck, but pierc'd not through, the mighty shield,
6150	Stay'd by the golden plate, the gift of Heav'n;
6150	Achilles' right fore-arm the other graz'd:
6150	Forth gush'd the crimson blood; but, glancing by
6150	And vainly longing for the taste of flesh,
6150	The point behind him in the earth was fix'd.
6150	Then at Asteropaeus in his turn
6150	With deadly intent the son of Peleus threw
6150	His straight-directed spear; his mark he miss'd,
6150	But struck the lofty bank, where, deep infix'd
6150	To half its length, the Pelian ash remain'd.
6150	Then from beside his thigh Achilles drew
6150	His trenchant blade, and, furious, onward rush'd;
6150	While from the cliff Asteropaeus strove
6150	In vain, with stalwart hand, to wrench the spear.
6150	Three times he shook it with impetuous force,
6150	Three times relax'd his grasp; a fourth attempt
6150	He made to bend and break the sturdy shaft;
6150	But him, preventing, Peleus' godlike son
6150	With deadly stroke across the belly smote,
6150	And gush'd his bowels forth; upon the ground
6150	Gasping he lay, and darkness seal'd his eyes.
6150	Then on his breast Achilles sprang, and stripp'd
6150	His armour off, and thus with vaunting speech:
6150	"""So lie thou there! 'tis hard for thee to fight,"
6150	Though river-born, against the progeny
6150	Of mighty Jove; a widely-flowing stream
6150	Thou claim'st as author of thy parentage;
6150	My high descent from Jove himself I boast.
6150	My father Peleus, son of AEacus,
6150	Reigns o'er the num'rous race of Myrmidons;
6150	The son of Jove himself was AEacus.
6150	High o'er all rivers, that to th' ocean flow,
6150	Is Jove exalted; and in like degree
6150	Superior is his race in pow'r to theirs.
6150	A mighty River hast thou here at hand,
6150	If that might aught avail thee; but his pow'r
6150	Is impotent to strive with Saturn's son.
6150	With him, not Achelous, King of streams,
6150	Presumes to vie; nor e'en the mighty strength
6150	Of deeply-flowing, wide Oceanus;
6150	From whom all rivers, all the boundless sea,
6150	All fountains, all deep wells derive their source;
6150	Yet him appals the lightning bolt of Jove,
6150	"And thunder, pealing from the vault of Heav'n."""
6150	He said, and from the cliff withdrew his spear.
6150	Him left he lifeless there upon the sand
6150	Extended; o'er him the dark waters wash'd,
6150	And eels and fishes, thronging, gnaw'd his flesh.
6150	Then 'mid the Paeons' plumed host he rush'd,
6150	Who fled along the eddying stream, when him,
6150	Their bravest in the stubborn fight, they saw
6150	Slain by the sword and arm of Peleus' son.
6150	Thersilochus and Mydon then he slew,
6150	Mnesus and Thrasius and Astypylus,
6150	AEnius and Ophelestes; and yet more
6150	Had been the slaughter by Achilles wrought,
6150	But from his eddying depths, in human form,
6150	With wrathful tone the mighty River spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""In strength, Achilles, and in deeds of arms,"
6150	All mortals thou surpassest; for the Gods
6150	Themselves attend thee, and protect from harm;
6150	If Saturn's son have given thee utterly
6150	The Trojans to destroy, yet, ere thou slay,
6150	Far from my waters drive them o'er the plain;
6150	For now my lovely stream is fill'd with dead;
6150	Nor can I pour my current to the sea,
6150	With floating corpses chok'd, whilst thou pursuest
6150	The work of death, insatiate: stay thy hand!
6150	"With horror I behold thee, mighty chief!"""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""Be it as thou wilt, Scamander, Heav'n-born stream;"
6150	Yet cease I not to slay until I drive
6150	These vaunting Trojans to their walls, and prove
6150	The force of Hector, if, in single fight,
6150	"I be by him, or he by me, subdued."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and fiercely on the Trojans rush'd,
6150	A God in might! to Phoebus then his speech
6150	The deeply-eddying River thus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""God of the silver bow, great son of Jove,"
6150	Obey'st thou thus the will of Saturn's son,
6150	Who charg'd thee by the Trojans still to stand,
6150	And aid their cause, till ev'ning's late approach
6150	"Should cast its shadows o'er the fertile earth?"""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, from off the lofty bank
6150	Achilles springing in mid current plung'd;
6150	Then high the swelling stream, tumultuous, rose
6150	In all its angry flood; and with a roar
6150	As of a bellowing bull, cast forth to land
6150	The num'rous corpses by Achilles slain;
6150	And many living, in his cavern'd bed,
6150	Conceal'd behind the whirling waters sav'd.
6150	Fierce, round Achilles, rose the boiling wave,
6150	And on his shield descending, drove him down;
6150	Nor might he keep his foothold; but he grasp'd
6150	A lofty elm, well-grown, which from the cliff
6150	Uprooted, all the bank had torn away,
6150	And with its tangled branches check'd the flow
6150	Of the fair river, which with all its length
6150	It bridg'd across; then, springing from the deep,
6150	Swiftly he fled in terror o'er the plain.
6150	Nor ceas'd the mighty River, but pursued,
6150	With darkly-ruffling crest, intent to stay
6150	Achilles' course, and save the Trojan host.
6150	Far as a jav'lin's flight he rush'd, in speed
6150	Like the dark hunter eagle, strongest deem'd,
6150	And swiftest wing'd of all the feather'd race.
6150	So on he sped; loud rattled on his breast
6150	His brazen armour, as before the God,
6150	Cow'ring, he fled; the God behind him still
6150	With thund'ring sound pursued. As when a man
6150	From some dark-water'd spring through trenches leads,
6150	'Mid plants and gardens, th' irrigating stream,
6150	And, spade in hand, th' appointed channel clears:
6150	Down flows the stream anon, its pebbly bed
6150	Disturbing; fast it flows with bubbling sound,
6150	Down the steep slope, o'ertaking him who leads.
6150	Achilles so th' advancing wave o'ertook,
6150	Though great his speed; but man must yield to Gods,
6150	Oft as Achilles, swift of foot, essay'd
6150	To turn and stand, and know if all the Gods,
6150	Who dwell in Heav'n, were leagued to daunt his soul
6150	So oft the Heav'n-born River's mighty wave
6150	Above his shoulders dash'd; in deep distress
6150	He sprang on high; then rush'd the flood below,
6150	And bore him off his legs, and wore away
6150	The soil beneath his feet; then, groaning, thus,
6150	As up to Heav'n he look'd, Achilles cried:
6150	"""O Father Jove, will none of all the Gods"
6150	In pity save me from this angry flood?
6150	Content, thereafter, would I meet my fate.
6150	Of all the pow'rs of Heav'n, my mother most
6150	Hath wrong'd me, who hath buoy'd me up with hope
6150	Delusive, that, before the walls of Troy,
6150	I should by Phoebus' swift-wing'd arrows fall.
6150	Would that by Hector's hand 'twere mine to die,
6150	The bravest of their brave! a warrior so
6150	Were by a warrior slain! now am I doom'd
6150	Ignobly here to sink, the mighty flood
6150	O'erwhelming me, like some poor shepherd lad,
6150	"Borne down in crossing by a wintry brook."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and quickly, cloth'd in mortal form,
6150	Neptune and Pallas at his side appear'd;
6150	With cheering words they took him by the hand,
6150	And thus th' Earth-shaking God his speech began:
6150	""
6150	"""Achilles, fear not thou, nor be dismay'd;"
6150	Such pow'rful aid, by Jove's consent, we bring,
6150	Pallas and I, from Heav'n; 'tis not decreed
6150	That thou shouldst by the River be o'erwhelm'd;
6150	He shall retire ere long, and thou shalt see;
6150	And more, if thou wilt hear, we undertake
6150	That from the war thine arm shall not be stay'd,
6150	Till thou shalt drive beneath the walls of Troy
6150	The crowd of flying Trojans; thou thyself
6150	Shalt Hector slay, and safe regain the ships:
6150	"Such high renown we give thee to achieve."""
6150	""
6150	They to the other Gods, this said, return'd;
6150	He, greatly strengthen'd by the voice divine,
6150	Press'd onwards to the plain; the plain he found
6150	All flooded o'er; and, floating, armour fair,
6150	And many a corpse of men in battle slain;
6150	Yet onward, lifting high his feet, he press'd
6150	Right tow'rd the stream; nor could the mighty stream
6150	Check his advance, such vigour Pallas gave;
6150	Nor did Scamander yet his fury stay,
6150	But fiercer rose his rage; and rearing high
6150	His crested wave, to Simois thus he cried:
6150	""
6150	"""Dear brother, aid me with united force"
6150	This mortal's course to check; he, unrestrain'd,
6150	Will royal Priam's city soon destroy,
6150	Nor will the Trojans his assault endure.
6150	Haste to the rescue then, and from their source
6150	Fill all thy stream, and all thy channels swell;
6150	Rouse thy big waves, and roll a torrent down
6150	Of logs and stones, to whelm this man of might,
6150	Who triumphs now, and bears him as a God.
6150	Nought shall his strength or beauty then avail,
6150	Or gallant arms, beneath the waters sunk,
6150	Deep buried in the mud: himself will I
6150	In sand imbed, and o'er his corpse a pile
6150	Of shingly gravel heap; nor shall the Greeks
6150	Be able to collect his bones, encas'd
6150	By me so deep in slime. His monument
6150	They here may raise; but when they celebrate
6150	"His fun'ral rites, no mound will he require."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and on Achilles, from on high
6150	Came boiling, rushing down, with thund'ring roar,
6150	With foam and blood and corpses intermix'd.
6150	High rose the Heav'n-born River's darkling wave,
6150	And bore Achilles downward; then in fear
6150	Lest the broad waters of the eddying stream
6150	Should quite o'erwhelm him, Juno cried aloud,
6150	And Vulcan thus, her son, in haste address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Up, Vulcan; up, my son; for we had deem'd"
6150	That eddying Xanthus stood to thee oppos'd:
6150	Haste thee to aid; thy fiery strength display;
6150	While from the sea I call the stormy blast
6150	Of Zephyr and brisk Notus, who shall drive
6150	The raging flames ahead, and burn alike
6150	The Trojans and their arms: do thou the while
6150	Burn down the trees on Xanthus' banks; himself
6150	Assail with fire, nor by his honey'd words
6150	Nor by his menaces be turn'd aside;
6150	Nor, till thou hear my voice, restrain thy pow'r;
6150	"Then stay the raging flames' unwearied course."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Juno spoke; and Vulcan straight prepar'd
6150	The heav'nly fire; and first upon the plain
6150	The flames he kindled, and the dead consum'd,
6150	Who lay, promiscuous, by Achilles slain:
6150	The plain was dried, and stay'd the wat'ry flood.
6150	As when the breath of Boreas quickly dries
6150	In Autumn-time a newly-water'd field,
6150	The tiller's heart rejoicing: so was dried
6150	The spacious plain; then he, the dead consum'd,
6150	Against the river turn'd the fiery glare:
6150	Burnt were the willows, elms, and tamarisk shrubs,
6150	The lotus, and the reeds, and galingal,
6150	Which by the lovely river grew profuse.
6150	The eels and fishes, 'mid the eddying whirl,
6150	'Mid the clear wave were hurrying here and there,
6150	In dire distress from Vulcan's fiery breath:
6150	Scorch'd by the flames, the mighty River spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Vulcan, no God against thy pow'r can stand,"
6150	Nor with thy fiery flames will I contend;
6150	Restrain thy wrath; though Peleus' godlike son
6150	Should from their city drive the Trojans straight,
6150	"With rival parties what concern have I?"""
6150	""
6150	All scorch'd he spoke; his fair stream bubbling up,
6150	As when a caldron on a blazing fire,
6150	Fill'd with the melting fat of well-fed swine,
6150	Boils up within, and bubbles all around,
6150	With well-dried wood beneath, so bubbling up
6150	The waters of the lovely River boil'd:
6150	Nor onward would he flow, but check'd his course,
6150	By the hot blast o'er-borne, and fiery strength
6150	Of skilful Vulcan; and to Juno thus,
6150	Imploring, he his winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Juno, what cause impels thy son, my stream,"
6150	O'er all the rest, to visit with his wrath?
6150	E'en less than others who the Trojans aid,
6150	Have I offended; yet at thy command
6150	Will I withdraw; but bid that he too cease;
6150	And this I swear, no Trojan more to save,
6150	Though to devouring flames a prey, all Troy
6150	"Were blazing, kindled by the valiant Greeks."""
6150	""
6150	This when the white-arm'd Goddess Juno heard,
6150	To Vulcan straight she thus address'd her speech:
6150	"""Vulcan, my glorious son, restrain thy hand:"
6150	In mortal men's behalf, it is not meet
6150	"To press thus hardly an Immortal God."""
6150	""
6150	She said, and Vulcan stay'd his fiery strength,
6150	And, back returning, in his wonted bed
6150	Flow'd the fair River. Xanthus thus subdued,
6150	These two their warfare ceas'd, by Juno check'd,
6150	Despite her wrath; but 'mid the other Gods
6150	Arose contention fierce, and discord dire,
6150	Their warring passions rous'd on either side.
6150	With fearful crash they met: the broad Earth groan'd;
6150	Loud rang the Heav'n as with a trumpet's sound:
6150	Jove, on Olympus' height, the tumult heard,
6150	And in his heart he laugh'd a joyous laugh,
6150	To see the Gods in angry battle met.
6150	Not long they stood aloof, led on by Mars
6150	The buckler-breaker, who to Pallas first,
6150	Poising his spear, his bitter speech address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""What dost thou here, thou saucy jade, to war"
6150	The Gods exciting, overbold of mood,
6150	Led by thy haughty spirit? dost thou forget
6150	How thou the son of Tydeus, Diomed,
6150	Didst urge against me, and with visible spear
6150	Direct his aim, and aid to wound my flesh?
6150	"For all I suffer'd then, thou now shalt pay."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, he struck the tassell'd shield,
6150	Awful to view, which not the lightning bolt
6150	Of Jove himself could pierce: the blood-stain'd Mars
6150	Against it thrust in vain his pond'rous spear.
6150	The Goddess stoop'd, and in her ample hand
6150	Took up a stone, that lay upon the plain,
6150	Dark, rugged, vast, which men of elder days
6150	Had set to mark the limits of their land.
6150	Full on the neck of Mars she hurl'd the mass,
6150	His limbs relaxing: o'er sev'n hundred feet
6150	Prostrate he lay, his hair defil'd with dust:
6150	Loud rang his armour; and with scornful smile
6150	Pallas address'd him thus with vaunting speech:
6150	""
6150	"""Fool, hast thou yet to learn how mightier far"
6150	My strength than thine, that me thou dar'st to meet?
6150	Bear thus the burthen of thy mother's curse,
6150	Who works thee harm, in wrath that thou the Greeks
6150	"Deserting, aid'st the haughty Trojans' cause."""
6150	""
6150	She said, and turn'd away her piercing glance:
6150	Him, deeply groaning, scarce to life restor'd,
6150	Jove's daughter Venus taking by the hand,
6150	Led from the field; which when the white-arm'd Queen
6150	Beheld, in haste to Pallas thus she cried:
6150	"""O Heav'n, brave child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
6150	Undaunted! lo again this saucy jade
6150	Amid the press, the bane of mortals, Mars
6150	"Leads from the field; but haste thee in pursuit."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Juno: Pallas hasten'd in pursuit
6150	Well pleas'd; and Venus with her pow'rful hand
6150	Assailing, struck upon the breast; at once
6150	The Goddess' courage and her limbs gave way.
6150	There on the ground the two together lay,
6150	While Pallas o'er them thus with vaunting speech:
6150	""
6150	"""Would all were such, who aid the Trojan cause,"
6150	Whene'er they meet in fight the warlike Greeks,
6150	As valiant and as stout as Venus proves,
6150	Who brings her aid to Mars, confronting me;
6150	Then had our warlike labours long been o'er,
6150	"And Ilium's strong-built citadel overthrown."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Pallas spoke: the white-arm'd Goddess smil'd,
6150	And to Apollo thus th' Earth-shaker spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Phoebus, why stand we idly thus aloof?"
6150	The war begun by others, 'tis not meet;
6150	And shame it were, that to Olympus' height
6150	And to the brazen-floor'd abode of Jove
6150	We two without a contest should return.
6150	Thou then begin, as younger: 'twere not well
6150	For me, in age and practice more advanc'd.
6150	Feeble of soul, how senseless is thy heart!
6150	Hast thou forgotten all the cruel wrongs
6150	We two, alone of all th' Immortals, bore,
6150	When here, in Ilium, for a year, we serv'd,
6150	By Jove's command, the proud Laomedon,
6150	For promis'd hire; and he our tasks assign'd?
6150	His fortress, and a wall both broad and fair
6150	I built, the town's impregnable defence;
6150	While thou didst on his plodding herds attend,
6150	In many-crested Ida's woody glens.
6150	But when the joyous seasons, in their course,
6150	Had brought our labour's term, the haughty King
6150	Denied our guerdon, and with threats dismiss'd.
6150	Bound hand and foot, he threaten'd thee to send
6150	And sell to slav'ry in the distant isles,
6150	And with the sword cut off the ears of both.
6150	So in indignant sorrow we return'd,
6150	Robb'd of the hire he promis'd, but denied.
6150	For this thy favour dost thou show to Troy;
6150	And dost not rather join thy force to ours,
6150	That down upon their knees the Trojans all
6150	"Should perish, with their babes and matrons chaste."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus the far-destroying King:
6150	"""Earth-shaking God, I should not gain with thee"
6150	The esteem of wise, if I with thee should fight
6150	For mortal men; poor wretches, who like leaves
6150	Flourish awhile, and eat the fruits of earth,
6150	But, sapless, soon decay: from combat then
6150	"Refrain we, and to others leave the strife."""
6150	""
6150	He turn'd, thus saying: for he deem'd it shame
6150	His father's brother to assail in arms;
6150	But him his sister, Goddess of the chase,
6150	Rebuk'd, and thus with scornful speech address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Fliest thou, Apollo? and to Neptune leav'st"
6150	The easy victory and baseless fame?
6150	Why o'er thy shoulder hangs thine idle bow?
6150	Ne'er in our father's halls again, as erst
6150	Among th' Immortals, let me hear thee boast
6150	"How thou with Neptune wouldst in arms contend."""
6150	""
6150	Thus she; Apollo answer'd not a word;
6150	But Jove's imperial consort, fill'd with wrath,
6150	Assail'd with bitter words the Archer-Queen.
6150	""
6150	"""How canst thou dare, thou saucy minx, to stand                 [7]"
6150	Oppos'd to me, too great for thine assault,
6150	Despite thy bow? though Jove hath giv'n thee pow'r
6150	O'er feeble women, whom thou wilt, to slay,
6150	E'en as a lion; better were't for thee
6150	To chase the mountain beasts and flying hinds,
6150	Than thy superiors thus to meet in arms,
6150	But since thou dar'st confront me, thou shalt know
6150	"And feel how far my might surpasses thine."""
6150	""
6150	She said; and with the left hand both the wrists
6150	Of Dian grasping, with her ample right
6150	The bow and quiver from her shoulders tore;
6150	And with them, as she turn'd away her head,
6150	With scornful laughter buffeted her ears:
6150	The arrows keen were scatter'd on the ground:
6150	Weeping, the Goddess fled; as flies a dove
6150	The hawk's pursuit, and in a hollow rock
6150	Finds refuge, doom'd not yet to fall a prey;
6150	So, weeping, Dian fled, and left her bow.
6150	""
6150	"Them Hermes to Latona thus: ""With thee"
6150	I strive not; shame it were to meet in fight
6150	A consort of the cloud-compelling Jove.
6150	Freely amid th' Immortals make thy boast,
6150	"That by thy prowess thou hast vanquish'd me."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he: Latona gather'd up the bow,
6150	And fallen arrows, scatter'd here and there
6150	Amid the whirling dust; then, these regain'd,
6150	Following her daughter, from the field withdrew.
6150	Meanwhile to high Olympus fled the Maid,
6150	And to the brazen-floor'd abode of Jove.
6150	There, weeping, on her father's knees she sat,
6150	While quiver'd round her form th' ambrosial robe.
6150	The son of Saturn tow'rds him drew his child,
6150	And thus, with gracious smile, enquiry made:
6150	"""Which of the heav'nly pow'rs hath wrong'd thee thus"
6150	"My child, as guilty of some open shame?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom the bright-crown'd Goddess of the chase:
6150	"""Thy wife, my father, white-arm'd Juno; she"
6150	Hath dealt thus rudely with me; she, from whom
6150	"All jars and strife among the Gods proceed."""
6150	""
6150	Such converse while they held, the gates of Troy
6150	Apollo enter'd, for the well-built wall
6150	Alarm'd, lest e'en against the will of fate
6150	The Greeks that day should raze it to the ground.
6150	The other Gods were to Olympus gone,
6150	Triumphant these, and those in angry mood,
6150	And took their seats before the cloud-girt Sire.
6150	But on the Trojans pressing, Peleus' son
6150	Horses and men alike, promiscuous, slew.
6150	As in a city, which the Gods in wrath
6150	Have fir'd, whose volleying smoke ascends to Heav'n,
6150	On all her people grievous toil is cast,
6150	On many, harm and loss; such toil, such loss
6150	Achilles wrought amid the Trojan host.
6150	""
6150	Upon a lofty tow'r, the work of Gods,
6150	The aged Priam stood, and thence beheld
6150	By fierce Achilles driven in flight confused,
6150	Their courage quite subdued, the Trojan host:
6150	Then, groaning, from the tow'r he hasten'd down,
6150	And to the warders cried along the wall:
6150	""
6150	"""Stand to the gates, and hold them open'd wide,"
6150	That in the crowd of fugitives may pour,
6150	And refuge find; for close upon their flight
6150	Achilles hangs; disaster now is near.
6150	But while our friends, receiv'd within the walls,
6150	Find time to breathe again, replace in haste
6150	The closely-fitting portals; for I fear
6150	"That man of blood may e'en the city storm."""
6150	""
6150	He said; the gates they open'd, and drew back
6150	The solid bars; the portals, op'ning wide,
6150	Let in the light; but in the vacant space
6150	Apollo stood, the Trojan host to save.
6150	The flyers, parch'd with thirst and dust-begrim'd,
6150	Straight for the city and the lofty wall
6150	Made from the plain; Achilles, spear in hand,
6150	Press'd hotly on the rearmost; for his soul
6150	With rage was fill'd, and madd'ning lust of fame.
6150	And now the lofty-gated city of Troy
6150	The sons of Greece had won; but Phoebus rous'd
6150	Agenor's spirit, a valiant youth and strong,
6150	Son of Antenor; he his bosom fill'd
6150	With dauntless courage, and beside him stood
6150	To turn aside the heavy hand of death,
6150	As, veil'd in cloud, against the oak he lean'd.
6150	He, when Achilles' awful form he knew,
6150	Yet firmly stood, though much perplex'd in mind,
6150	As thus he commun'd with his mighty heart:
6150	""
6150	"""Oh woe is me! should I attempt to fly"
6150	Before Achilles' might, where fly the rest
6150	Across the plain, disorder'd, he would soon
6150	O'ertake me, and in flight ignoble slay.
6150	Or should I leave the others to their fate,
6150	Scatter'd by Peleus' son; and from the wall
6150	And o'er the plain of Troy direct my flight,
6150	Far as the foot of Ida's hill, and there
6150	Lie hid in thickest covert; and at eve,
6150	Refresh'd by bathing in the cooling stream,
6150	And purg'd the sweat, retrace my steps to Troy?
6150	Yet why, my soul, admit such thoughts as these?
6150	For should he mark me flying from the town,
6150	And overtake me by his speed of foot,
6150	No hope were left me of escape from death.
6150	So far his strength exceeds the strength of man.
6150	But how if boldly I await him here
6150	Before the wall? his flesh is not to wounds
6150	Impervious: but a single life is his,
6150	Nor is he more, they say, than mortal man,
6150	"Though Jove assists him, and his triumph wills."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and stood collected, to await
6150	Achilles' onset; and his manly heart,
6150	With courage fill'd, was eager for the fray.
6150	As when a panther from the thicket's depth
6150	Comes forth to meet the hunter, undismay'd,
6150	Nor turn'd to flight by baying of the hounds;
6150	Nor, wounded or by jav'lin or by sword,
6150	Or by the spear transfix'd, remits her rage,
6150	But fights, until she reach her foe, or die;
6150	Agenor so, Antenor's godlike son,
6150	Disdain'd to fly, ere prove Achilles' might.
6150	Before his breast his shield's broad orb he bore,
6150	And pois'd his spear, as thus he call'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Thy hope, renown'd Achilles, was this day"
6150	The valiant Trojans' city to destroy;
6150	Unconscious of the toils, the woes, that ye
6150	Around her walls await ye! for within
6150	Are warriors brave and num'rous, who will fight
6150	In her defence, for parents, children, wives.
6150	Thou too, Achilles, here shalt meet thy doom,
6150	"All-pow'rful as thou art, and warrior bold."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and threw with stalwart hand the spear;
6150	Achilles' leg he struck, below the knee,
6150	Nor miss'd his aim; and loudly rang the greaves
6150	Of new-wrought tin; but back the brazen point
6150	Rebounded, nor the heav'nly armour pierc'd.
6150	In turn Achilles on Agenor sprang:
6150	But Phoebus robb'd him of his hop'd-for prize,
6150	Who, veil'd in thickest cloud, convey'd away
6150	Antenor's son, and from the battle bore
6150	To rest in peace; while he by guile withdrew
6150	The son of Peleus from the flying crowd:
6150	For in Agenor's very likeness clad,
6150	Before him stood the far-destroying King:
6150	Then fled, Achilles hast'ning in pursuit.
6150	He o'er the fertile plain with flying foot
6150	Pursu'd; beside Scamander's eddying stream
6150	Apollo turn'd, and still but little space
6150	Before him flying, subtly lur'd him on,
6150	Each moment hoping to attain his prize.
6150	Meantime the gen'ral crowd, in panic flight,
6150	With eager haste the city's refuge sought,
6150	And all the town with fugitives was fill'd.
6150	Nor did they dare without the walls to stand
6150	For mutual aid; nor halt to know what friends
6150	Were safe, who left upon the battle-field;
6150	But through the gates pour'd in the hurrying mass
6150	Who to their active limbs their safety ow'd.

6150	THE DEATH OF HECTOR.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose
6150	Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his
6150	son to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins his entreaties, but in vain.
6150	Hector consults within himself what measures to take; but, at the
6150	advance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies: Achilles
6150	pursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning
6150	the fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.
6150	She deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and
6150	is slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot, in the sight of
6150	Priam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries
6150	reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into
6150	the inner part of the palace; she mounts up to the walls, and beholds
6150	her dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and
6150	lamentation.
6150	""
6150	The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and
6150	on the battlements of Troy.

6150	""
6150	""
6150	Thus they from panic flight, like timorous fawns.
6150	Within the walls escaping, dried their sweat,
6150	And drank, and quench'd their thirst, reclining safe
6150	On the fair battlements; but nearer drew,
6150	With slanted shields, the Greeks; yet Hector still
6150	In front of Ilium and the Scaean gate,
6150	Stay'd by his evil doom, remain'd without;
6150	Then Phoebus thus to Peleus' godlike son:
6150	"""Achilles, why with active feet pursue,"
6150	Thou mortal, me Immortal? know'st thou not
6150	My Godhead, that so hot thy fury burns?
6150	Or heed'st thou not that all the Trojan host
6150	Whom thou hast scar'd, while thou art here withdrawn,
6150	Within the walls a refuge safe have found?
6150	"On me thy sword is vain! I know not death!"""
6150	""
6150	Enrag'd, Achilles, swift of foot, replied:
6150	"""Deep is the injury, far-darting King,"
6150	Most hostile of the Gods, that at thy hand
6150	I bear, who here hast lur'd me from the walls,
6150	Which many a Trojan else had fail'd to reach,
6150	Ere by my hand they bit the bloody dust.
6150	Me of immortal honour thou hast robb'd,
6150	And them, thyself from vengeance safe, hast sav'd.
6150	"Had I the pow'r, that vengeance thou shouldst feel."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, and on mightiest deeds intent,
6150	He turn'd him city-ward, with fiery speed;
6150	As when a horse, contending for the prize,
6150	Whirls the swift car, and stretches o'er the plain,
6150	E'en so, with active limbs, Achilles rac'd.
6150	""
6150	Him first the aged Priam's eyes discern'd,
6150	Scouring the plain, in arms all dazzling bright,
6150	Like to th' autumnal star, whose brilliant ray
6150	Shines eminent amid the depth of night,
6150	Whom men the dog-star of Orion call;
6150	The brightest he, but sign to mortal man
6150	Of evil augury, and fiery heat:
6150	So shone the brass upon the warrior's breast.
6150	""
6150	The old man groan'd aloud, and lifting high
6150	His hands, he beat his head, and with loud voice
6150	Call'd on his son, imploring; he, unmov'd,
6150	Held post before the gates, awaiting there
6150	Achilles' fierce encounter; him his sire,
6150	With hands outstretch'd and piteous tone, address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, my son, await not here alone"
6150	That warrior's charge, lest thou to fate succumb,
6150	Beneath Pelides' arm, thy better far!
6150	Accurs'd be he! would that th' immortal Gods
6150	So favour'd him as I! then should his corpse
6150	Soon to the vultures and the dogs be giv'n!
6150	(So should my heart a load of anguish lose)
6150	By whom I am of many sons bereav'd,
6150	Many and brave, whom he has slain, or sold
6150	To distant isles in slav'ry; and e'en now,
6150	Within the city walls I look in vain
6150	For two, Lycaon brave, and Polydore,
6150	My gallant sons, by fair Laothoe:
6150	If haply yet they live, with brass and gold
6150	Their ransom shall be paid; good store of these
6150	We can command; for with his daughter fair
6150	A wealthy dowry aged Altes gave.
6150	But to the viewless shades should they have gone,
6150	Deep were their mother's sorrow and my own;
6150	But of the gen'ral public, well I know
6150	Far lighter were the grief, than if they heard
6150	That thou hadst fall'n beneath Achilles' hand.
6150	Then enter now, my son, the city gates,
6150	And of the women and the men of Troy,
6150	Be still the guardian; nor to Peleus' son,
6150	With thine own life, immortal glory give.
6150	Look too on me with pity; me, on whom,
6150	E'en on the threshold of mine age, hath Jove
6150	A bitter burthen cast, condemn'd to see
6150	My sons struck down, my daughters dragg'd away
6150	In servile bonds; our chambers' sanctity
6150	Invaded; and our babes by hostile hands
6150	Dash'd to the ground; and by ferocious Greeks
6150	Enslav'd the widows of my slaughter'd sons.
6150	On me at last the rav'ning dogs shall feed,
6150	When by some foeman's hand, by sword or lance,
6150	My soul shall from my body be divorc'd;
6150	Those very dogs which I myself have bred,
6150	Fed at my table, guardians of my gate,
6150	Shall lap my blood, and over-gorg'd shall lie
6150	E'en on my threshold. That a youth should fall
6150	Victim, to Mars, beneath a foeman's spear,
6150	May well beseem his years; and if he fall
6150	With honour, though he die, yet glorious he!
6150	But when the hoary head and hoary beard,
6150	And naked corpse to rav'ning dogs are giv'n,
6150	"No sadder sight can wretched mortals see."""
6150	""
6150	The old man spoke, and from, his head he tore
6150	The hoary hair; yet Hector firm remain'd.
6150	Then to the front his mother rush'd, in tears,
6150	Her bosom bare, with either hand her breast
6150	Sustaining, and with tears address'd him thus:
6150	"""Hector, my child, thy mother's breast revere;"
6150	And on this bosom if thine infant woes
6150	Have e'er been hush'd, bear now in mind, dear child,
6150	The debt thou ow'st; and from within the walls
6150	Ward off this fearful man, nor in the field
6150	Encounter; curs'd be he! should he prevail,
6150	And slay thee, not upon the fun'ral bed,
6150	My child, my own, the offspring of my womb,
6150	Shall I deplore thee, nor thy widow'd wife,
6150	But far away, beside the Grecian ships,
6150	"Thy corpse shall to the rav'ning dogs be giv'n."""
6150	""
6150	Thus they, with tears and earnest pray'rs imploring,
6150	Address'd their son; yet Hector firm remain'd,
6150	Waiting th' approach of Peleus' godlike son.
6150	As when a snake upon the mountain side,
6150	With deadly venom charg'd, beside his hole,
6150	Awaits the traveller, and fill'd with rage,
6150	Coil'd round his hole, his baleful glances darts;
6150	So fill'd with dauntless courage Hector stood,
6150	Scorning retreat, his gleaming buckler propp'd
6150	Against the jutting tow'r; then, deeply mov'd,
6150	Thus with his warlike soul communion held:
6150	""
6150	"""Oh woe is me! if I should enter now"
6150	The city gates, I should the just reproach
6150	Encounter of Polydamas, who first
6150	His counsel gave within the walls to lead
6150	The Trojan forces, on that fatal night
6150	When great Achilles in the field appear'd.
6150	I heeded not his counsel; would I had!
6150	Now, since my folly hath the people slain,
6150	I well might blush to meet the Trojan men,
6150	And long-rob'd dames of Troy, lest some might say,
6150	To me inferior far, 'This woful loss
6150	To Hector's blind self-confidence we owe.'
6150	Thus shall they say; for me, 'twere better far,
6150	Or from Achilles, slain in open fight,
6150	Back to return in triumph, or myself
6150	To perish nobly in my country's cause.
6150	What if my bossy shield I lay aside,
6150	And stubborn helmet, and my pond'rous spear
6150	Propping against the wall, go forth to meet
6150	Th' unmatch'd Achilles? What if I engage
6150	That Helen's self, and with her all the spoil,
6150	And all that Paris in his hollow ships
6150	Brought here to Troy, whence first this war arose,
6150	Should be restor'd; and to the Greeks be paid
6150	An ample tribute from the city's stores,
6150	Her secret treasures; and hereafter bind
6150	The Trojans by their Elders' solemn oaths
6150	Nought to withhold, but fairly to divide
6150	Whate'er of wealth our much-loved city holds?
6150	But wherefore entertain such thoughts, my soul?
6150	Should I so meet him, what if he should show
6150	Nor pity nor remorse, but slay me there,
6150	Defenceless as a woman, and unarm'd?
6150	Not this the time, nor he the man, with whom
6150	By forest oak or rock, like youth and maid,
6150	To hold light talk, as youth and maid might hold.
6150	Better to dare the fight, and know at once
6150	"To whom the vict'ry is decreed by Heav'n."""
6150	""
6150	Thus, as he stood, he mus'd; but near approach'd
6150	Achilles, terrible as plumed Mars;
6150	From his right shoulder brandishing aloft
6150	The ashen spear of Peleus, while around
6150	Flash'd his bright armour, dazzling as the glare
6150	Of burning fire, or of the rising sun.
6150	Hector beheld, and trembled at the sight;
6150	Nor dar'd he there await th' attack, but left
6150	The gates behind, and, terror-stricken, fled.
6150	Forward, with flying foot, Pelides rush'd.
6150	As when a falcon, bird of swiftest flight,
6150	From some high mountain-top, on tim'rous dove
6150	Swoops fiercely down; she, from beneath, in fear,
6150	Evades the stroke; he, dashing through the brake,
6150	Shrill-shrieking, pounces on his destin'd prey;
6150	So, wing'd with desp'rate hate, Achilles flew,
6150	So Hector, flying from his keen pursuit,
6150	Beneath the walls his active sinews plied.
6150	They by the watch-tow'r, and beneath the wall
6150	Where stood the wind-beat fig-tree, rac'd amain
6150	Along the public road, until they reach'd
6150	The fairly-flowing fount whence issu'd forth,
6150	From double source, Scamander's eddying streams.
6150	One with hot current flows, and from beneath,
6150	As from a furnace, clouds of steam arise;
6150	'Mid summer's heat the other rises cold
6150	As hail, or snow, or water crystalliz'd;
6150	Beside the fountains stood the washing-troughs
6150	Of well-wrought stone, where erst the wives of Troy
6150	And daughters fair their choicest garments wash'd,
6150	In peaceful times, ere came the sons of Greece.
6150	There rac'd they, one in flight, and one pursuing;
6150	Good he who fled, but better who pursu'd,
6150	With fiery speed; for on that race was stak'd
6150	No common victim, no ignoble ox:
6150	The prize at stake was mighty Hector's life.
6150	As when the solid-footed horses fly
6150	Around the course, contending for the prize,
6150	Tripod, or woman of her lord bereft;
6150	So rac'd they thrice around the walls of Troy
6150	With active feet; and all the Gods beheld.
6150	Then thus began the Sire of Gods and men:
6150	"""A woful sight mine eyes behold; a man"
6150	I love in flight around the walls! my heart
6150	For Hector grieves, who, now upon the crown
6150	Of deeply-furrow'd Ida, now again
6150	On Ilium's heights, with fat of choicest bulls
6150	Hath pil'd mine altar; whom around the walls,
6150	With flying speed Achilles now pursues.
6150	Give me your counsel, Gods, and say, from death
6150	If we shall rescue him, or must he die,
6150	"Brave as he is, beneath Pelides' hand?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom the blue-ey'd Goddess, Pallas, thus:
6150	"""O Father, lightning-flashing, cloud-girt King,"
6150	What words are these? wouldst thou a mortal man,
6150	Long doom'd by fate, again from death preserve?
6150	"Do as thou wilt, but not with our consent."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
6150	"""Be of good cheer, my child! unwillingly"
6150	I speak, yet both thy wishes to oppose:
6150	"Have then thy will, and draw not back thy hand."""
6150	""
6150	His words fresh impulse gave to Pallas' zeal,
6150	And from Olympus' heights in haste she sped.
6150	""
6150	Meanwhile on Hector, with untiring hate.
6150	The swift Achilles press'd: as when a hound,
6150	Through glen and tangled brake, pursues a fawn,
6150	Rous'd from its lair upon the mountain side;
6150	And if awhile it should evade pursuit,
6150	Low crouching in the copse, yet quests he back,
6150	Searching unwearied, till he find the trace;
6150	So Hector sought to baffle, but in vain,
6150	The keen pursuit of Peleus' active son.
6150	Oft as he sought the shelter of the gates
6150	Beneath the well-built tow'rs, if haply thence
6150	His comrades' weapons might some aid afford;
6150	So oft his foeman, with superior speed,
6150	Would cut him off, and turn him to the plain.
6150	He tow'rd the city still essay'd his flight;
6150	And as in dreams, when one pursues in vain,
6150	One seeks in vain to fly, the other seeks
6150	As vainly to pursue; so could not now
6150	Achilles reach, nor Hector quit, his foe.
6150	Yet how should Hector now the doom of death
6150	Have 'scap'd, had not Apollo once again,
6150	And for the last time, to his rescue come,
6150	And giv'n him strength and suppleness of limb?
6150	""
6150	Then to the crowd Achilles with his head
6150	Made sign that none at Hector should presume
6150	To cast a spear, lest one might wound, and so
6150	The greater glory obtain, while he himself
6150	Must be contented with the second place.
6150	But when the fourth time in their rapid course
6150	The founts were reach'd, th' Eternal Father hung
6150	His golden scales aloft, and plac'd in each
6150	The lots of doom, for great Achilles one,
6150	For Hector one, and held them by the midst:
6150	Down sank the scale, weighted with Hector's death,
6150	Down to the shades, and Phoebus left his side.
6150	""
6150	Then to Pelides came the blue-ey'd Maid,
6150	And stood beside him, and bespoke him thus:
6150	"""Achilles, lov'd of Heav'n, I trust that now"
6150	To thee and me great glory shall accrue
6150	In Hector's fall, insatiate of the fight.
6150	Escape he cannot now, though at the feet
6150	Of aegis-bearing Jove, on his behalf,
6150	With earnest pray'r Apollo prostrate fall.
6150	But stay thou here and take thy breath, while I
6150	"Persuade him to return and dare the fight."""
6150	""
6150	So Pallas spoke; and he with joy obeying,
6150	Stood leaning on his brass-barb'd ashen spear.
6150	The Goddess left him there, and went (the form
6150	And voice assuming of Deiphobus)
6150	In search of godlike Hector; him she found,
6150	And standing near, with winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Sorely, good brother, hast thou been bested"
6150	By fierce Achilles, who around the walls
6150	Hath chas'd thee with swift foot; now stand we both
6150	"For mutual succour, and his onset wait."""
6150	""
6150	To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
6150	"""Deiphobus, of all my brothers, sons"
6150	Of Hecuba and Priam, thou hast been
6150	Still dearest to my heart; and now the more
6150	I honour thee who dar'st on my behalf,
6150	Seeing my peril, from within the walls
6150	"To sally forth, while others skulk behind."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the blue-ey'd Goddess thus replied:
6150	"""With many pray'rs, good brother, both our sire"
6150	And honour'd mother, and our comrades all
6150	Successively implored me to remain;
6150	Such fear is fall'n on all; but in my soul
6150	On thine account too deep a grief I felt.
6150	Now, forward boldly! spare we not our spears;
6150	Make trial if Achilles to the ships
6150	From both of us our bloody spoils can bear,
6150	"Or by thine arm himself may be subdued."""
6150	""
6150	Thus Pallas lur'd him on with treach'rous wile;
6150	But when the two were met, and close at hand,
6150	First spoke great Hector of the glancing helm:
6150	""
6150	"""No more before thee, Peleus' son, I fly:"
6150	Thrice have I fled around the walls, nor dar'd
6150	Await thine onset; now my spirit is rous'd
6150	To stand before thee, to be slain, or slay.
6150	But let us first th' immortal Gods invoke;
6150	The surest witnesses and guardians they
6150	Of compacts: at my hand no foul disgrace
6150	Shalt thou sustain, if Jove with victory
6150	Shall crown my firm endurance, and thy life
6150	To me be forfeit; of thine armour stripp'd
6150	I promise thee, Achilles, to the Greeks
6150	"Thy body to restore; do thou the like."""
6150	""
6150	With fierce regard Achilles answer'd thus:
6150	"""Hector, thou object of my deadly hate,"
6150	Talk not to me of compacts; as 'tween men
6150	And lions no firm concord can exist,
6150	Nor wolves and lambs in harmony unite,
6150	But ceaseless enmity between them dwells:
6150	So not in friendly terms, nor compact firm,
6150	Can thou and I unite, till one of us
6150	Glut with his blood the mail-clad warrior Mars.
6150	Mind thee of all thy fence; behoves thee now
6150	To prove a spearman skill'd, and warrior brave.
6150	For thee escape is none; now, by my spear,
6150	Hath Pallas doom'd thy death; my comrades' blood,
6150	"Which thou hast shed, shall all be now aveng'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and poising, hurl'd his weighty spear;
6150	But Hector saw, and shunn'd the blow; he stoop'd,
6150	And o'er his shoulder flew the brass-tipp'd spear,
6150	And in the ground was fix'd; but Pallas drew
6150	The weapon forth, and to Achilles' hand,
6150	All unobserv'd of Hector, gave it back.
6150	Then Hector thus to Peleus' matchless son:
6150	""
6150	"""Thine aim has fail'd; nor truly has my fate,"
6150	Thou godlike son of Peleus, been to thee
6150	From Heav'n reveal'd; such was indeed thy boast;
6150	But flippant was thy speech, and subtly fram'd
6150	To scare me with big words, and make me prove
6150	False to my wonted prowess and renown.
6150	Not in my back will I receive thy spear,
6150	But through my breast, confronting thee, if Jove
6150	Have to thine arm indeed such triumph giv'n.
6150	Now, if thou canst, my spear in turn elude;
6150	May it be deeply buried in thy flesh!
6150	For lighter were to Troy the load of war,
6150	"If thou, the greatest of her foes, wert slain."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and poising, hurl'd his pond'rous spear;
6150	Nor miss'd his aim; full in the midst he struck
6150	Pelides' shield; but glancing from the shield
6150	The weapon bounded off. Hector was griev'd,
6150	That thus his spear had bootless left his hand.
6150	He stood aghast; no second spear was nigh:
6150	And loudly on Deiphobus he call'd
6150	A spear to bring; but he was far away.
6150	Then Hector knew that he was dup'd, and cried,
6150	"""Oh Heav'n! the Gods above have doom'd my death!"
6150	I deem'd indeed that brave Deiphobus
6150	Was near at hand; but he within the walls
6150	Is safe, and I by Pallas am betray'd.
6150	Now is my death at hand, nor far away:
6150	Escape is none; since so hath Jove decreed,
6150	And Jove's far-darting son, who heretofore
6150	Have been my guards; my fate hath found me now.
6150	Yet not without a struggle let me die,
6150	Nor all inglorious; but let some great act,
6150	"Which future days may hear of, mark my fall."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, his sharp-edged sword he drew,
6150	Pond'rous and vast, suspended at his side;
6150	Collected for the spring, and forward dash'd:
6150	As when an eagle, bird of loftiest flight,
6150	Through the dark clouds swoops downward on the plain,
6150	To seize some tender lamb, or cow'ring hare;
6150	So Hector rush'd, and wav'd his sharp-edg'd sword.
6150	Achilles' wrath was rous'd: with fury wild
6150	His soul was fill'd: before his breast he bore
6150	His well-wrought shield; and fiercely on his brow
6150	Nodded the four-plum'd helm, as on the breeze
6150	Floated the golden hairs, with which the crest
6150	By Vulcan's hand was thickly interlac'd;
6150	And as amid the stars' unnumber'd host,
6150	When twilight yields to night, one star appears,
6150	Hesper, the brightest star that shines in Heav'n,
6150	Gleam'd the sharp-pointed lance, which in his right
6150	Achilles pois'd, on godlike Hector's doom
6150	Intent, and scanning eagerly to see
6150	Where from attack his body least was fenc'd.
6150	All else the glitt'ring armour guarded well,
6150	Which Hector from Patroclus' corpse had stripp'd;
6150	One chink appear'd, just where the collar-bone
6150	The neck and shoulder parts, beside the throat,
6150	Where lies expos'd the swiftest road of death.
6150	There levell'd he, as Hector onward rush'd;
6150	Right through the yielding neck the lance was driv'n,
6150	But sever'd not the windpipe, nor destroy'd
6150	His pow'r of speech; prone in the dust he fell;
6150	And o'er him, vaunting, thus Achilles spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Hector, Patroclus stripping of his arms,"
6150	Thy hope was that thyself wast safe; and I,
6150	Not present, brought no terror to thy soul:
6150	Fool! in the hollow ships I yet remain'd,
6150	I, his avenger, mightier far than he;
6150	I, who am now thy conqu'ror. By the dogs
6150	And vultures shall thy corpse be foully torn,
6150	"While him the Greeks with fun'ral rites shall grace."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd Hector of the glancing helm,
6150	"Prostrate and helpless: ""By thy soul, thy knees,"
6150	Thy parents' heads, Achilles, I beseech,
6150	Let not my corpse by Grecian dogs be torn.
6150	Accept the ample stores of brass and gold,
6150	Which as my ransom by my honour'd sire
6150	And mother shall be paid thee; but my corpse
6150	Restore, that so the men and wives of Troy
6150	"May deck with honours due my fun'ral pyre."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, with fierce aspect, Achilles thus:
6150	"""Knee me no knees, vile hound! nor prate to me"
6150	Of parents! such my hatred, that almost
6150	I could persuade myself to tear and eat
6150	Thy mangled flesh; such wrongs I have to avenge,
6150	He lives not, who can save thee from the dogs;
6150	Not though with ransom ten and twenty fold
6150	He here should stand, and yet should promise more;
6150	No, not though Priam's royal self should sue
6150	To be allow'd for gold to ransom thee;
6150	No, not e'en so, thy mother shall obtain
6150	To lay thee out upon the couch, and mourn
6150	O'er thee, her offspring; but on all thy limbs
6150	"Shall dogs and carrion vultures make their feast."""
6150	""
6150	To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm,
6150	"Dying: ""I know thee well; nor did I hope"
6150	To change thy purpose; iron is thy soul.
6150	But see that on thy head I bring not down
6150	The wrath of Heav'n, when by the Scaean gate
6150	The hand of Paris, with Apollo's aid,
6150	"Brave warrior as thou art, shall strike thee down."""
6150	""
6150	E'en as he spoke, his eyes were clos'd in death;
6150	And to the viewless shades his spirit fled,
6150	Mourning his fate, his youth and vigour lost.
6150	""
6150	To him, though dead, Achilles thus replied:
6150	"""Die thou! my fate I then shall meet, whene'er"
6150	"Jove and th' immortal Gods shall so decree."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and from the corpse his spear withdrew,
6150	And laid aside; then stripp'd the armour off,
6150	With, blood besmear'd; the Greeks around him throng'd,
6150	Gazing on Hector's noble form and face,
6150	And none approach'd that did not add a wound:
6150	"And one to other look'd, and said, ""Good faith,"
6150	Hector is easier far to handle now,
6150	"Then when erewhile he wrapp'd our ships in fire."""
6150	Thus would they say, then stab the dead anew.
6150	""
6150	But when the son of Peleus, swift of foot,
6150	Had stripp'd the armour from the corpse, he rose,
6150	And, standing, thus th' assembled Greeks address'd:
6150	"""O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
6150	Since Heav'n hath granted us this man to slay,
6150	Whose single arm hath wrought us more of ill
6150	Than all the rest combin'd, advance we now
6150	Before the city in arms, and trial make
6150	What is the mind of Troy; if, Hector slain,
6150	They from the citadel intend retreat,
6150	Or still, despite their loss, their ground maintain.
6150	But wherefore entertain such thoughts, my soul?
6150	Beside the ships, unwept, unburied, lies
6150	Patroclus: whom I never can forget,
6150	While number'd with the living, and my limbs
6150	Have pow'r to move; in Hades though the dead
6150	May be forgotten, yet e'en there will I
6150	The mem'ry of my lov'd companion keep.
6150	Now to the ships return we, sons of Greece,
6150	Glad paeans singing! with us he shall go;
6150	Great glory is ours, the godlike Hector slain,
6150	"The pride of Troy, and as a God rever'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and foully Hector's corpse misus'd;
6150	Of either foot he pierc'd the tendon through,
6150	That from the ancle passes to the heel,
6150	And to his chariot bound with leathern thongs,
6150	Leaving the head to trail along the ground;
6150	Then mounted, with the captur'd arms, his car,
6150	And urg'd his horses; nothing loth, they flew.
6150	A cloud of dust the trailing body rais'd:
6150	Loose hung his glossy hair; and in the dust
6150	Was laid that noble head, so graceful once;
6150	Now to foul insult doom'd by Jove's decree,
6150	In his own country, by a foeman's hand.
6150	So lay the head of Hector; at the sight
6150	His aged mother tore her hair, and far
6150	From off her head the glitt'ring veil she threw,
6150	And with loud cries her slaughter'd son bewail'd.
6150	Piteous, his father groan'd; and all around
6150	Was heard the voice of wailing and of woe.
6150	Such was the cry, as if the beetling height
6150	Of Ilium all were smould'ring in the fire.
6150	Scarce in his anguish could the crowd restrain
6150	The old man from issuing through the Dardan gates;
6150	Low in the dust he roll'd, imploring all,
6150	Entreating by his name each sev'ral man:
6150	"""Forbear, my friends; though sorrowing, stay me not;"
6150	Leave me to reach alone the Grecian ships,
6150	And there implore this man of violence,
6150	This haughty chief, if haply he my years
6150	May rev'rence, and have pity on my age.
6150	For he too has a father, like to me;
6150	Peleus, by whom he was begot, and bred,
6150	The bane of Troy; and, most of all, to me
6150	The cause of endless grief, who by his hand
6150	Have been of many stalwart sons bereft.
6150	Yet all, though griev'd for all, I less lament,
6150	Than one, whose loss will sink me to the grave,
6150	Hector! oh would to Heav'n that in mine arms
6150	He could have died; with mourning then and tears
6150	We might have satisfied our grief, both she
6150	"Who bore him, hapless mother, and myself."""
6150	""
6150	Weeping, he spoke; and with him wept the crowd:
6150	Then, 'mid the women, Hecuba pour'd forth
6150	"Her vehement grief: ""My child, oh whither now,"
6150	Heart-stricken, shall I go, of thee bereft,
6150	Of thee, who wast to me by night and day
6150	A glory and a boast; the strength of all
6150	The men of Troy, and women? as a God
6150	They worshipp'd thee: for in thy life thou wast
6150	"The glory of all; but fate hath found thee now."""
6150	""
6150	Weeping, she spoke; but nought as yet was known
6150	To Hector's wife; to her no messenger
6150	Had brought the tidings, that without the walls
6150	Remained her husband; in her house withdrawn
6150	A web she wove, all purple, double woof,
6150	With varied flow'rs in rich embroidery,
6150	And to her neat-hair'd maidens gave command
6150	To place the largest caldrons on the fire,
6150	That with warm baths, returning from the fight,
6150	Hector might be refresh'd; unconscious she,
6150	That by Achilles' hand, with Pallas' aid,
6150	Far from the bath, was godlike Hector slain.
6150	The sounds of wailing reach'd her from the tow'r;
6150	Totter'd her limbs, the distaff left her hand,
6150	And to her neat-hair'd maidens thus she spoke:
6150	"""Haste, follow me, some two, that I may know"
6150	What mean these sounds; my honour'd mother's voice
6150	I hear; and in my breast my beating heart
6150	Leaps to my mouth; my limbs refuse to move;
6150	Some evil, sure, on Priam's house impends.
6150	Be unfulfill'd my words! yet much I fear
6150	Lest my brave Hector be cut off alone,
6150	By great Achilles, from the walls of Troy,
6150	Chas'd to the plain, the desp'rate courage quench'd,
6150	Which ever led him from the gen'ral ranks
6150	"Far in advance, and bade him yield to none."""
6150	""
6150	Then from the house she rush'd, like one distract,
6150	With beating heart; and with her went her maids.
6150	But when she reach'd the tow'r, where stood the crowd,
6150	And mounted on the wall, she look'd around,
6150	And saw the body which with insult foul
6150	The flying steeds were dragging towards the ships;
6150	Then sudden darkness overspread her eyes;
6150	Backward she fell, and gasp'd her spirit away.
6150	Far off were flung th' adornments of her head,
6150	The net, the fillet, and the woven bands;
6150	The nuptial veil by golden Venus giv'n,
6150	That day when Hector of the glancing helm
6150	Led from Eetion's house his wealthy bride.
6150	The sisters of her husband round her press'd,
6150	And held, as in the deadly swoon she lay.
6150	But when her breath and spirit return'd again,
6150	With sudden burst of anguish thus she cried:
6150	"""Hector, oh woe is me! to misery"
6150	We both were born alike; thou here in Troy
6150	In Priam's royal palace; I in Thebes,
6150	By wooded Placos, in Eetion's house,
6150	Who nurs'd my infancy; unhappy he,
6150	Unhappier I! would I had ne'er been born!
6150	Now thou beneath the depths of earth art gone,
6150	Gone to the viewless shades; and me hast left
6150	A widow in thy house, in deepest woe;
6150	Our child, an infant still, thy child and mine,
6150	Ill-fated parents both! nor thou to him,
6150	Hector, shalt be a guard, nor he to thee:
6150	For though he 'scape this tearful war with Greece,
6150	Yet nought for him remains but ceaseless woe,
6150	And strangers on his heritage shall seize.
6150	No young companions own the orphan boy:
6150	With downcast eyes, and cheeks bedew'd with tears,
6150	His father's friends approaching, pinch'd with want,
6150	He hangs upon the skirt of one, of one
6150	He plucks the cloak; perchance in pity some
6150	May at their tables let him sip the cup,
6150	Moisten his lips, but scarce his palate touch;
6150	While youths, with both surviving parents bless'd,
6150	May drive him from their feast with blows and taunts,
6150	'Begone! thy father sits not at our board:'
6150	Then weeping, to his widow'd mother's arms
6150	He flies, that orphan boy, Astyanax,
6150	Who on his father's knees erewhile was fed
6150	On choicest marrow, and the fat of lambs;
6150	And, when in sleep his childish play was hush'd,
6150	Was lull'd to slumber in his nurse's arms
6150	On softest couch, by all delights surrounded.
6150	But grief, his father lost, awaits him now,
6150	Astyanax, of Trojans so surnam'd,
6150	Since thou alone wast Troy's defence and guard.
6150	But now on thee, beside the beaked ships,
6150	Far from thy parents, when the rav'ning dogs
6150	Have had their fill, the wriggling worms shall feed;
6150	On thee, all naked; while within thy house
6150	Lies store of raiment, rich and rare, the work
6150	Of women's hands; these will I burn with fire;
6150	Not for thy need--thou ne'er shalt wear them more,--
6150	"But for thine honour in the sight of Troy."""
6150	""
6150	Weeping she spoke; the women join'd her wail.

6150	FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Achilles and the Myrmidons do honour to the body of Patroclus. After
6150	the funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep,
6150	the ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of
6150	burial: the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons
6150	to fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering
6150	their hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and
6150	lastly, twelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He
6150	pays libations to the winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and
6150	raise the flame. When the pile has burned all night, they gather the
6150	bones, place them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles
6150	institutes the funeral games: the chariot-race, the fight of the
6150	caestus, the wrestling, the footrace, the single combat, the discus,
6150	the shooting with arrows, the darting the javelin: the various
6150	descriptions of which, and the various success of the several
6150	antagonists, make the greatest part of the book.
6150	""
6150	In this book ends the thirtieth day: the night following, the ghost of
6150	Patroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in
6150	felling the timber for the pile; the two-and-thirtieth in burning it;
6150	and the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the
6150	sea-shore.

6150	BOOK XXIII.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	Thus they throughout the city made their moan;
6150	But when the Greeks had come where lay their ships
6150	By the broad Hellespont, their sev'ral ways
6150	They each pursu'd, dispersing; yet not so
6150	Achilles let his Myrmidons disperse,
6150	But thus his warlike comrades he address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""My faithful comrades, valiant Myrmidons,"
6150	Loose we not yet our horses from the cars;
6150	But for Patroclus mourn, approaching near,
6150	With horse and car; such tribute claim the dead;
6150	Then, free indulgence to our sorrows giv'n,
6150	"Loose we the steeds, and share the ev'ning meal."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and they with mingled voices rais'd
6150	The solemn dirge; Achilles led the strain;
6150	Thrice round the dead they drove their sleek-skinn'd steeds,
6150	Mourning, with hearts by Thetis grief-inspir'd;
6150	With tears the sands, with tears the warriors' arms,
6150	Were wet; so mighty was the chief they mourn'd.
6150	Then on his comrade's breast Achilles laid
6150	His blood-stain'd hands, and thus began the wail:
6150	""
6150	"""All hail, Patroclus, though in Pluto's realm;"
6150	All that I promis'd, lo! I now perform;
6150	That on the corpse of Hector, hither dragg'd,
6150	Our dogs should feed; and that twelve noble youths,
6150	The sons of Troy, before thy fun'ral pyre,
6150	"My hand, in vengeance for thy death, should slay."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and foully Hector's corpse misus'd,
6150	Flung prostrate in the dust, beside the couch
6150	Where lay Menoetius' son. His comrades then
6150	Their glitt'ring armour doff'd, of polish'd brass,
6150	And loos'd their neighing steeds; then round the ship
6150	Of Peleus' son in countless numbers sat,
6150	While he th' abundant fun'ral feast dispens'd.
6150	There many a steer lay stretch'd beneath the knife,
6150	And many a sheep, and many a bleating goat,
6150	And many a white-tusk'd porker, rich in fat,
6150	There lay extended, singeing o'er the fire;
6150	And blood, in torrents, flow'd around the corpse.
6150	To Agamemnon then the Kings of Greece
6150	The royal son of Peleus, swift of foot,
6150	Conducted; yet with him they scarce prevail'd;
6150	So fierce his anger for his comrade's death.
6150	But when to Agamemnon's tent they came,
6150	He to the clear-voic'd heralds gave command
6150	An ample tripod on the fire to place;
6150	If haply Peleus' son he might persuade
6150	To wash away the bloody stains of war:
6150	But sternly he, and with an oath refus'd.
6150	""
6150	"""No, by great Jove I swear, of all the Gods"
6150	Highest and mightiest, water shall not touch
6150	This head of mine, till on the fun'ral pyre
6150	I see the body of Patroclus laid,
6150	And build his tomb, and cut my votive hair;
6150	For while I live and move 'mid mortal men,
6150	No second grief like this can pierce my soul.
6150	Observe we now the mournful fun'ral feast;
6150	But thou, great Agamemnon, King of men,
6150	Send forth at early dawn, and to the camp
6150	Bring store of fuel, and all else prepare,
6150	That with provision meet the dead may pass
6150	Down to the realms of night; so shall the fire
6150	From out our sight consume our mighty dead,
6150	"And to their wonted tasks the troops return."""
6150	""
6150	He said; they listen'd, and his words obey'd;
6150	Then busily the ev'ning meal prepar'd,
6150	And shar'd the social feast; nor lack'd there aught.
6150	The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,
6150	Each to their sev'ral tents the rest repair'd;
6150	But on the many-dashing ocean's shore
6150	Pelides lay, amid his Myrmidons,
6150	With bitter groans; in a clear space he lay,
6150	Where broke the waves, continuous, on the beach.
6150	There, circumfus'd around him, gentle sleep,
6150	Lulling the sorrows of his heart to rest,
6150	O'ercame his senses; for the hot pursuit
6150	Of Hector round the breezy heights of Troy
6150	His active limbs had wearied: as he slept,
6150	Sudden appear'd Patroclus' mournful shade,
6150	His very self; his height, and beauteous eyes,
6150	And voice; the very garb he wont to wear:
6150	Above his head it stood, and thus it spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Sleep'st thou, Achilles, mindless of thy friend,"
6150	Neglecting, not the living, but the dead?
6150	Hasten, my fun'ral rites, that I may pass
6150	Through Hades' gloomy gates; ere those be done,
6150	The spirits and spectres of departed men
6150	Drive me far from them, nor allow to cross
6150	Th' abhorred river; but forlorn and sad
6150	I wander through the wide-spread realms of night.
6150	And give me now thy hand, whereon to weep;
6150	For never more, when laid upon the pyre,
6150	Shall I return from Hades; never more,
6150	Apart from all our comrades, shall we two,
6150	As friends, sweet counsel take; for me, stern Death,
6150	The common lot of man, has op'd his mouth;
6150	Thou too, Achilles, rival of the Gods,
6150	Art destin'd here beneath the walls of Troy
6150	To meet thy doom; yet one thing must I add,
6150	And make, if thou wilt grant it, one request.
6150	Let not my bones be laid apart from thine,
6150	Achilles, but together, as our youth
6150	Was spent together in thy father's house,
6150	Since first my sire Menoetius me a boy
6150	From Opus brought, a luckless homicide,
6150	Who of Amphidamas, by evil chance,
6150	Had slain the son, disputing o'er the dice:
6150	Me noble Peleus in his house receiv'd,
6150	And kindly nurs'd, and thine attendant nam'd;
6150	So in one urn be now our bones enclos'd,
6150	"The golden vase, thy Goddess-mother's gift."""
6150	""
6150	Whom answer'd thus Achilles, swift of foot:
6150	"""Why art thou here, lov'd being? why on me"
6150	These sev'ral charges lay? whate'er thou bidd'st
6150	Will I perform, and all thy mind fulfil;
6150	But draw thou near; and in one short embrace,
6150	"Let us, while yet we may, our grief indulge."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, he spread his longing arms,
6150	But nought he clasp'd; and with a wailing cry,
6150	Vanish'd, like smoke, the spirit beneath the earth.
6150	Up sprang Achilles, all amaz'd, and smote
6150	His hands together, and lamenting cried:
6150	""
6150	"""O Heav'n, there are then, in the realms below,"
6150	Spirits and spectres, unsubstantial all;
6150	For through the night Patroclus' shade hath stood,
6150	Weeping and wailing, at my side, and told
6150	"His bidding; th' image of himself it seem'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said; his words the gen'ral grief arous'd:
6150	To them, as round the piteous dead they mourn'd,
6150	Appear'd the rosy-finger'd morn; and straight,
6150	From all the camp, by Agamemnon sent,
6150	Went forth, in search of fuel, men and mules,
6150	Led by a valiant chief, Meriones,
6150	The follower of renown'd Idomeneus.
6150	Their felling axes in their hands they bore,
6150	And twisted ropes; their mules before them driv'n;
6150	Now up, now down, now sideways, now aslope,
6150	They journey'd on; but when they reach'd the foot
6150	Of spring-abounding Ida, they began
6150	With axes keen to hew the lofty oaks;
6150	They, loudly crashing, fell: the wood they clove,
6150	And bound it to the mules; these took their way
6150	Through the thick brushwood, hurrying to the plain.
6150	The axe-men too, so bade Meriones,
6150	The follower of renown'd Idomeneus,
6150	Were laden all with logs, which on the beach
6150	They laid in order, where a lofty mound,
6150	In mem'ry of Patroclus and himself,
6150	Achilles had design'd. When all the store
6150	Of wood was duly laid, the rest remain'd
6150	In masses seated; but Achilles bade
6150	The warlike Myrmidons their armour don,
6150	And harness each his horses to his car;
6150	They rose and donn'd their arms, and on the cars
6150	Warriors and charioteers their places took.
6150	""
6150	First came the horse, and then a cloud of foot,
6150	Unnumber'd; in the midst Patroclus came,
6150	Borne by his comrades; all the corpse with hair
6150	They cover'd o'er, which from their heads they shore.
6150	Behind, Achilles held his head, and mourn'd
6150	The noble friend whom to the tomb he bore.
6150	Then on the spot by Peleus' son assign'd,
6150	They laid him down, and pil'd the wood on high.
6150	Then a fresh thought Achilles' mind conceiv'd:
6150	Standing apart, the yellow locks he shore,
6150	Which as an off'ring to Sperchius' stream,
6150	He nurs'd in rich profusion; sorrowing then
6150	Look'd o'er the dark-blue sea, as thus lie spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Sperchius, all in vain to thee his pray'r"
6150	My father Peleus made, and vow'd that I,
6150	Return'd in safety to my native land,
6150	To thee should dedicate my hair, and pay
6150	A solemn hecatomb, with sacrifice
6150	Of fifty rams, unblemish'd, to the springs
6150	Where on thy consecrated soil is plac'd
6150	Thine incense-honour'd altar; so he vow'd;
6150	But thou the boon withhold'st; since I no more
6150	My native land may see, the hair he vow'd,
6150	"To brave Patroclus thus I dedicate."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and on his comrade's hand he laid
6150	The locks; his act the gen'ral grief arous'd;
6150	And now the setting sun had found them still
6150	Indulging o'er the dead; but Peleus' son
6150	Approaching, thus to Agamemnon spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Atrides, for to thee the people pay"
6150	Readiest obedience, mourning too prolong'd
6150	May weary; thou then from the pyre the rest
6150	Disperse, and bid prepare the morning meal;
6150	Ours be the farther charge, to whom the dead
6150	"Was chiefly dear; yet let the chiefs remain."""
6150	""
6150	The monarch Agamemnon heard, and straight
6150	Dispers'd the crowd amid their sev'ral ships.
6150	Th' appointed band remain'd, and pil'd the wood.
6150	A hundred feet each way they built the pyre,
6150	And on the summit, sorrowing, laid the dead.
6150	Then many a sheep and many a slow-paced ox
6150	They flay'd and dress'd around the fun'ral pyre;
6150	Of all the beasts Achilles took the fat,
6150	And cover'd o'er the corpse from head to foot,
6150	And heap'd the slaughter'd carcases around;
6150	Then jars of honey plac'd, and fragrant oils,
6150	Resting upon the couch; next, groaning loud,
6150	Four pow'rful horses on the pyre he threw;
6150	Then, of nine dogs that at their master's board
6150	Had fed, he slaughter'd two upon his pyre;
6150	Last, with the sword, by evil counsel sway'd,
6150	Twelve noble youths he slew, the sons of Troy.
6150	The fire's devouring might he then applied,
6150	And, groaning, on his lov'd companion call'd:
6150	""
6150	"""All hail, Patroclus, though in Pluto's realm!"
6150	All that I promis'd, lo! I now perform:
6150	On twelve brave sons of Trojan sires, with thee,
6150	The flames shall feed; but Hector, Priam's son,
6150	"Not to the fire, but to the dogs I give."""
6150	""
6150	Such was Achilles' threat, but him the dogs
6150	Molested not; for Venus, night and day
6150	Daughter of Jove, the rav'ning dogs restrain'd;
6150	And all the corpse o'erlaid with roseate oil,
6150	Ambrosial, that though dragg'd along the earth,
6150	The noble dead might not receive a wound.
6150	Apollo too a cloudy veil from Heav'n
6150	Spread o'er the plain, and cover'd all the space
6150	Where lay the dead, nor let the blazing sun
6150	The flesh upon his limbs and muscles parch.
6150	""
6150	Yet burnt not up Patroclus' fun'ral pyre;
6150	Then a fresh thought Achilles' mind conceiv'd:
6150	"Standing apart, on both the ""Winds he call'd,"
6150	Boreas and Zephyrus, and added vows
6150	Of costly sacrifice; and pouring forth
6150	Libations from a golden goblet, pray'd
6150	Their presence, that the wood might haste to burn,
6150	And with the fire consume the dead; his pray'r
6150	Swift Iris heard, and bore it to the Winds.
6150	They in the hall of gusty Zephyrus
6150	Were gather'd round the feast; in haste appearing,
6150	Swift Iris on the stony threshold stood.
6150	They saw, and rising all, besought her each
6150	To sit beside him; she with their requests
6150	Refus'd compliance, and address'd them thus:
6150	""
6150	"""No seat for me; for I o'er th' ocean stream"
6150	From hence am bound to AEthiopia's shore,
6150	To share the sacred feast, and hecatombs,
6150	Which there they offer to th' immortal Gods;
6150	But, Boreas, thee, and loud-voic'd Zephyrus,
6150	With vows of sacrifice, Achilles calls
6150	To fan the fun'ral pyre, whereon is laid
6150	"Patroclus, mourn'd by all the host of Greece."""
6150	""
6150	She said, and vanish'd; they, with rushing sound,
6150	Rose, and before them drove the hurrying clouds:
6150	Soon o'er the sea they swept; the stirring breeze
6150	Ruffled the waves; the fertile shores of Troy
6150	They reach'd, and falling on the fun'ral pyre,
6150	Loud roar'd the crackling flames; they all night long
6150	With current brisk together fann'd the fire.
6150	All night Achilles from a golden bowl
6150	Drew forth, and, in his hand a double cup,
6150	The wine outpouring, moisten'd all the earth,
6150	Still calling on his lost Patroclus' shade.
6150	As mourns a father o'er a youthful son,
6150	Whose early death hath wrung his parents' hearts;
6150	So mourn'd Achilles o'er his friend's remains,
6150	Prostrate beside the pyre, and groan'd aloud.
6150	But when the star of Lucifer appear'd,
6150	The harbinger of light, whom following close
6150	Spreads o'er the sea the saffron-robed morn,
6150	Then pal'd the smould'ring fire, and sank the flame;
6150	And o'er the Thracian sea, that groan'd and heav'd
6150	Beneath their passage, home the Winds return'd;
6150	And weary, from the pyre a space withdrawn,
6150	Achilles lay, o'ercome by gentle sleep.
6150	""
6150	Anon, awaken'd by the tramp and din
6150	Of crowds that follow'd Atreus' royal son,
6150	He sat upright, and thus address'd his speech:
6150	""
6150	"""Thou son of Atreus, and ye chiefs of Greece,"
6150	Far as the flames extended, quench we first
6150	With ruddy wine the embers of the pyre;
6150	And of Menoetius' son, Patroclus, next
6150	With care distinguishing, collect the bones;
6150	Nor are they hard to know; for in the midst
6150	He lay, while round the edges of the pyre,
6150	Horses and men commix'd, the rest were burnt.
6150	Let these, between a double layer of fat
6150	Enclos'd, and in a golden urn remain,
6150	Till I myself shall in the tomb be laid;
6150	And o'er them build a mound, not over-large,
6150	But of proportions meet; in days to come,
6150	Ye Greeks, who after me shall here remain,
6150	"Complete the work, and build it broad and high."""
6150	""
6150	Thus spoke Achilles; they his words obey'd:
6150	Far as the flames had reach'd, and thickly strown
6150	The embers lay, they quench'd with ruddy wine;
6150	Then tearfully their gentle comrade's bones
6150	Collected, and with double layers of fat
6150	Enclos'd, and in a golden urn encas'd;
6150	Then in the tent they laid them, overspread
6150	With veil of linen fair; then meting out
6150	Th' allotted space, the deep foundations laid
6150	Around the pyre, and o'er them heap'd the earth.
6150	Their task accomplished, all had now withdrawn;
6150	But Peleus' son the vast assembly stay'd,
6150	And bade them sit; then, prizes of the games,
6150	Tripods and caldrons from the tents he brought,
6150	And noble steeds, and mules, and sturdy steers,
6150	And women fair of form, and iron hoar.
6150	""
6150	First, for the contest of the flying cars
6150	The prizes he display'd: a woman fair,
6150	Well skill'd in household cares; a tripod vast,
6150	Two-handled, two and twenty measures round;
6150	These both were for the victor: for the next,
6150	A mare, unbroken, six years old, in foal
6150	Of a mule colt; the third, a caldron bright,
6150	Capacious of four measures, white and pure,
6150	By fire as yet untarnish'd; for the fourth,
6150	Of gold two talents; for the fifth, a vase
6150	With double cup, untouch'd by fire, he gave.
6150	Then, standing up, he thus address'd the Greeks:
6150	""
6150	"""Thou son of Atreus, and ye well-greav'd Greeks,"
6150	Before ye are the prizes, which await
6150	The contest of the cars; but if, ye Greeks,
6150	For any other cause these games were held,
6150	I to my tent should bear the foremost prize;
6150	For well ye know how far my steeds excel,
6150	Steeds of immortal race, which Neptune gave
6150	To Peleus, he to me, his son, transferr'd.
6150	But from the present strife we stand aloof,
6150	My horses and myself; they now have lost
6150	The daring courage and the gentle hand
6150	Of him who drove them, and with water pure
6150	Wash'd oft their manes, and bath'd with fragrant oil.
6150	For him they stand and mourn, with drooping heads
6150	Down to the ground, their hearts with sorrow fill'd;
6150	But ye in order range yourselves, who boast
6150	"Your well-built chariots and your horses' speed."""
6150	""
6150	He said: up sprang the eager charioteers;
6150	The first of all, Eumelus, King of men,
6150	Son of Admetus, matchless charioteer;
6150	Next, Tydeus' son, the valiant Diomed,
6150	With Trojan horses, from AEneas won,
6150	When by Apollo's aid himself escap'd;
6150	Then Heav'n-born Menelaus, Atreus' son,
6150	Two flying coursers harness'd to his car;
6150	His own, Podargus, had for yokefellow
6150	AEthe, a mare by Agamemnon lent:
6150	Her, Echepolus to Atrides gave,
6150	Anchises' son, that to the wars of Troy
6150	He might not be compell'd, but safe at home
6150	Enjoy his ease; for Jove had bless'd his store
6150	With ample wealth, in Sicyon's wide domain.
6150	Her now he yok'd, impatient for the course.
6150	The fourth, Antilochus, the gallant son
6150	Of Nestor, son of Neleus, mighty chief,
6150	Harness'd his sleek-skinn'd steeds; of Pylian race
6150	Were they who bore his car; to him, his sire
6150	Sage counsel pour'd in understanding ears:
6150	""
6150	"""Antilochus, though young in years thou art,"
6150	Yet Jove and Neptune love thee, and have well
6150	Instructed thee in horsemanship; of me
6150	Thou need'st no counsel; skill'd around the goal
6150	To whirl the chariot; but thou hast, of all,
6150	The slowest horses: whence I augur ill.
6150	But though their horses have the speed of thine,
6150	In skill not one of them surpasses thee.
6150	Then thou, dear boy, exert thine ev'ry art,
6150	That so thou mayst not fail to gain a prize.
6150	By skill, far more than strength, the woodman fells
6150	The sturdy oak; by skill the steersman guides
6150	His flying ship across the dark-blue sea,
6150	Though shatter'd by the blast; 'twixt charioteer
6150	And charioteer 'tis skill that draws the line.
6150	One, vainly trusting to his coursers' speed,
6150	Drives reckless here and there; o'er all the course,
6150	His horses, unrestrain'd, at random run.
6150	Another, with inferior horses far,
6150	But better skill'd, still fixing on the goal
6150	His eye, turns closely round, nor overlooks
6150	The moment when to draw the rein; but holds
6150	His steady course, and on the leader waits.
6150	A mark I give thee now, thou canst not miss:
6150	There stands a wither'd trunk, some six feet high,
6150	Of oak, or pine, unrotted by the rain;
6150	On either side have two white stones been plac'd,
6150	Where meet two roads; and all around there lies
6150	A smooth and level course; here stood perchance
6150	The tomb of one who died long years ago;
6150	Or former generations here have plac'd,
6150	As now Achilles hath decreed, a goal.
6150	There drive, as only not to graze the post;
6150	And leaning o'er the wicker body, leave
6150	Close on the left the stones; thine offside horse
6150	Then urge with voice and whip, and slack his rein,
6150	And let the nearside horse so closely graze,
6150	As that thy nave may seem to touch, the goal:
6150	But yet beware, lest, striking on the stone,
6150	Thy steeds thou injure, and thy chariot break,
6150	A source of triumph to thy rivals all,
6150	Of shame to thee; but thou sage caution use;
6150	For, following, if thou make the turn the first,
6150	Not one of all shall pass thee, or o'ertake;
6150	Not though Arion's self were in the car,
6150	Adrastus' flying steed, of heav'nly race,
6150	"Nor those which here Laomedon possess'd."""
6150	""
6150	This said, and to his son his counsels giv'n,
6150	The aged Nestor to his seat withdrew.
6150	Fifth in the lists Meriones appear'd.
6150	They mounted on their cars, and cast their lots:
6150	Achilles shook the helmet; first leaped forth
6150	The lot of Nestor's son, Antilochus;
6150	Next came the King Eumelus; after whom
6150	The valiant Menelaus, Atreus' son;
6150	The fourth, Meriones; and last of all,
6150	But ablest far, Tydides drew his place.
6150	They stood in line; Achilles pointed out,
6150	Ear on the level plain, the distant goal;
6150	And there in charge the godlike Phoenix plac'd,
6150	His father's ancient follower, to observe
6150	The course assign'd, and true report to make.
6150	Then all at once their whips they rais'd, and urg'd
6150	By rein, and hand, and voice, their eager steeds.
6150	They from the ships pursued their rapid course
6150	Athwart the distant plain; beneath their chests
6150	Rose like a cloud, or hurricane, the dust;
6150	Loose floated on the breeze their ample manes;
6150	The cars now skimm'd along the fertile ground,
6150	Now bounded high in air; the charioteers
6150	Stood up aloft, and ev'ry bosom beat
6150	With hope of vict'ry; each with eager shout
6150	Cheering his steeds, that scour'd the dusty plain.
6150	But when, the farthest limits of the course
6150	Attain'd, they turn'd beside the hoary sea,
6150	Strain'd to their utmost speed, were plainly seen
6150	The qualities of each; then in the front
6150	Appear'd Eumelus' flying mares, and next
6150	The Trojan horses of Tydides came:
6150	Nor these were far behind, but following close
6150	They seem'd in act to leap upon the car.
6150	Eumelus, on his neck and shoulders broad,
6150	Felt their warm breath; for o'er him, as they flew,
6150	Their heads were downward bent; and now, perchance,
6150	Had he or pass'd, or made an even race,
6150	But that, incens'd with valiant Diomed,
6150	Apollo wrested from his hands the whip.
6150	Then tears of anger from his eyelids fell,
6150	As gaining more and more the mares he saw,
6150	While, urg'd no more, his horses slack'd their speed.
6150	But Pallas mark'd Apollo's treach'rous wile;
6150	And hasting to the chief, restor'd his whip,
6150	And to his horses strength and courage gave.
6150	The Goddess then Admetus' son pursued,
6150	And snapp'd his chariot yoke; the mares, releas'd,
6150	Swerv'd from the track; the pole upon the ground
6150	Lay loosen'd from the car; and he himself
6150	Beside the wheel was from the chariot hurl'd.
6150	From elbows, mouth, and nose, the skin was torn;
6150	His forehead crush'd and batter'd in; his eyes
6150	Were fill'd with tears, and mute his cheerful voice.
6150	Tydides turn'd aside, and far ahead
6150	Of all the rest, pass'd on; for Pallas gave
6150	His horses courage, and his triumph will'd.
6150	Next him, the fair-hair'd Menelaus came,
6150	The son of Atreus; but Antilochus
6150	Thus to his father's horses call'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Forward, and stretch ye to your utmost speed;"
6150	I ask you not with those of Diomed
6150	In vain to strive, whom Pallas hath endued
6150	With added swiftness, and his triumph will'd;
6150	But haste ye, and o'ertake Atrides' car,
6150	Nor be by AEthe, by a mare, disgrac'd.
6150	Why, my brave horses, why be left behind?
6150	This too I warn ye, and will make it good:
6150	No more at Nestor's hand shall ye receive
6150	Your provender, but with the sword be slain,
6150	If by your faults a lower prize be ours;
6150	Then rouse ye now, and put forth all your speed,
6150	And I will so contrive, as not to fail
6150	"Of slipping past them in the narrow way."""
6150	""
6150	He said; the horses, of his voice in awe,
6150	Put forth their pow'rs awhile; before them soon
6150	Antilochus the narrow pass espied.
6150	It was a gully, where the winter's rain
6150	Had lain collected, and had broken through
6150	A length of road, and hollow'd out the ground:
6150	There Menelaus held his cautious course.
6150	Fearing collision; but Antilochus,
6150	Drawing his steeds a little from the track,
6150	Bore down upon him sideways: then in fear,
6150	The son of Atreus to Antilochus
6150	"Shouted aloud, ""Antilochus, thou driv'st"
6150	Like one insane; hold in awhile thy steeds;
6150	Here is no space; where wider grows the road,
6150	There thou mayst pass; but here, thou wilt but cause
6150	"Our cars to clash, and bring us both to harm."""
6150	""
6150	He said; but madlier drove Antilochus,
6150	Plying the goad, as though he heard him not.
6150	""
6150	Far as a discus' flight, by some stout youth,
6150	That tests his vigour, from the shoulder hurl'd,
6150	So far they ran together, side by side:
6150	Then dropp'd Atrides' horses to the rear,
6150	For he himself forbore to urge their speed,
6150	Lest, meeting in the narrow pass, the cars
6150	Should be o'erthrown, and they themselves, in haste
6150	To gain the vict'ry, in the dust be roll'd.
6150	Then thus, reproachful, to Antilochus:
6150	""
6150	"""Antilochus, thou most perverse of men!"
6150	Beshrew thy heart! we Greeks are much deceiv'd
6150	Who give thee fame for wisdom! yet e'en now
6150	"Thou shalt not gain, but on thine oath, the prize."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and to his horses call'd aloud:
6150	"""Slack not your speed, nor, as defeated, mourn;"
6150	Their legs and feet will sooner tire than yours,
6150	"For both are past the vigour of their youth."""
6150	Thus he; the horses, of his voice in awe,
6150	Put forth their pow'rs, and soon the leaders near'd.
6150	""
6150	Meanwhile the chieftains, seated in the ring,
6150	Look'd for the cars, that scour'd the dusty plain.
6150	The first to see them was Idomeneus,
6150	The Cretan King; for he, without the ring,
6150	Was posted high aloft; and from afar
6150	He heard and knew the foremost horseman's voice;
6150	Well too he knew the gallant horse that led,
6150	All bay the rest, but on his front alone
6150	A star of white, full-orbed as the moon:
6150	Then up he rose, and thus the Greeks address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
6150	Can ye too see, or I alone, the cars?
6150	A diff'rent chariot seems to me in front,
6150	A diff'rent charioteer; and they who first
6150	Were leading, must have met with some mischance.
6150	I saw them late, ere round the goal they turn'd,
6150	But see them now no more; though all around
6150	My eyes explore the wide-spread plain of Troy.
6150	Perchance the charioteer has dropp'd the reins,
6150	Or round the goal he could not hold the mares;
6150	Perchance has miss'd the turn, and on the plain
6150	Is lying now beside his broken car,
6150	While from the course his mettled steeds have flown.
6150	Stand up, and look yourselves; I cannot well
6150	Distinguish; but to me it seems a chief,
6150	Who reigns o'er Greeks, though of AEtolian race,
6150	"The son of Tydeus, valiant Diomed."""
6150	""
6150	Sharply Oileus' active son replied:
6150	"""Idomeneus, why thus, before the time,"
6150	So rashly speak? while the high-stepping steeds
6150	Are speeding yet across the distant plain.
6150	Thine eyes are not the youngest in the camp,
6150	Nor look they out the sharpest from thy head;
6150	But thou art ever hasty in thy speech,
6150	And ill becomes thee this precipitance.
6150	Since others are there here, thy betters far.
6150	The same are leading now, that led at first,
6150	"Eumelus' mares; 'tis he that holds the reins."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in anger thus the Cretan chief:
6150	"""Ajax, at wrangling good, in judgment naught,"
6150	And for aught else, among the chiefs of Greece
6150	Of small account--so stubborn is thy soul;
6150	Wilt thou a tripod or a caldron stake,
6150	And Agamemnon, Atreus' son, appoint
6150	The umpire to decide whose steeds are first?
6150	"So shalt thou gain thy knowledge at thy cost."""
6150	""
6150	He said; up sprang Oileus' active son,
6150	In anger to reply; and farther yet
6150	Had gone the quarrel, but Achilles' self
6150	Stood up, and thus the rival chiefs address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Forbear, both Ajax and Idomeneus,"
6150	This bitter interchange of wordy war;
6150	It is not seemly; and yourselves, I know,
6150	Another would condemn, who so should speak.
6150	But stay ye here, and seated in the ring,
6150	Their coming wait; they, hurrying to the goal,
6150	Will soon be here; and then shall each man know
6150	"Whose horses are the second, whose the first."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; but Tydeus' son drew near, his lash
6150	Still laid upon his horses' shoulder-points;
6150	As lightly they, high-stepping, scour'd the plain.
6150	Still on the charioteer the dust was flung;
6150	As close upon the flying-footed steeds
6150	Follow'd the car with gold and tin inlaid;
6150	And lightly, as they flew along, were left
6150	Impress'd the wheel-tracks on the sandy plain.
6150	There in the midst he stood, the sweat profuse
6150	Down-pouring from his horses' heads and chests;
6150	Down from the glitt'ring car he leap'd to earth,
6150	And lean'd his whip against the chariot yoke;
6150	Nor long delay'd the valiant Sthenelus,
6150	But eagerly sprang forth to claim the prize;
6150	Then to his brave companions gave in charge
6150	To lead away the woman, and to bear
6150	The tripod, while himself unyok'd the steeds.
6150	""
6150	Nest came the horses of Antilochus,
6150	Who had by stratagem, and not by speed,
6150	O'er Menelaus triumph'd; yet e'en so
6150	Atrides' flying coursers press'd him hard;
6150	For but so far as from the chariot-wheel
6150	A horse, when harness'd to a royal car;
6150	Whose tail, back-streaming, with the utmost hairs
6150	Brushes the felloes; close before the wheel,
6150	Small space between, he scours the wide-spread plain:
6150	So far was Menelaus in the rear
6150	Of Nestor's son; at first, a discus' cast
6150	Between them lay; but rapidly his ground
6150	He gain'd--so well the speed and courage serv'd
6150	Of AEthe, Agamemnon's beauteous mare;
6150	And, but a little farther were the course,
6150	Had pass'd him by, nor left the race in doubt.
6150	Behind the noble son of Atreus came,
6150	A jav'lin's flight apart, Meriones,
6150	The faithful follower of Idomeneus:
6150	His were the slowest horses, and himself
6150	The least experienc'd in the rapid race.
6150	Dragging his broken car, came last of all,
6150	His horses driv'n in front, Admetus' son;
6150	Achilles swift of foot with pity saw,
6150	And to the Greeks his winged words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""See where the best of all the last appears;"
6150	But let him take, as meet, the second prize;
6150	"The first belongs of right to Tydeus' son."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; they all assented to his words;
6150	And, by the gen'ral voice of Greece, the mare
6150	Had now been his; but noble Nestor's son,
6150	Antilochus, stood up, his right to claim,
6150	And to Achilles, Peleus' son, replied:
6150	"""Achilles, thou wilt do me grievous wrong,"
6150	If thou thy words accomplish; for my prize
6150	Thou tak'st away, because mishap befell
6150	His car and horses, by no fault of his;
6150	Yet had he to th' Immortals made his pray'r,
6150	He surely had not thus been last of all.
6150	But, pitying him, if so thy mind incline,
6150	Thy tents contain good store of gold, and brass,
6150	And sheep, and female slaves, and noble steeds;
6150	For him, of these, hereafter mayst thou take
6150	A prize of higher value; or e'en now,
6150	And with th' applause of all; but for the mare,
6150	I will not give her up; and let who will
6150	"Stand forth, my own right hand shall guard my prize."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and smil'd Achilles swift of foot,
6150	Delighted; for he lov'd the noble youth,
6150	To whom his winged words he thus address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Antilochus, if such be thy request,"
6150	That for Eumelus I should add a prize,
6150	This too I grant thee; and to him I give
6150	My breastplate, from Asteropaeus won,
6150	Of brass, around whose edge is roll'd a stream
6150	"Of shining tin; a gift of goodly price."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and bade Automedon, his friend
6150	And comrade, bring the breastplate from his tent;
6150	He went, and brought it; in Eumelus' hand
6150	He plac'd it; he with joy the gift receiv'd.
6150	Then Menelaus, sad at heart, arose,
6150	Burning with wrath against Antilochus;
6150	And while the herald in the monarch's hand
6150	His royal sceptre plac'd, and bade the Greeks
6150	Keep silence, thus the godlike hero spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Antilochus, till now reputed wise,"
6150	What hast thou done? thou hast impugn'd my skill,
6150	And sham'd my horses, who hast brought thine own,
6150	Inferior far, before them to the goal.
6150	But come, ye chiefs and councillors of Greece,
6150	Judge ye between us, fav'ring neither side:
6150	That none of all the brass-clad Greeks may say
6150	That Menelaus hath by false reports
6150	O'erborne Antilochus, and holds his prize:
6150	His horses fairly worsted, and himself
6150	Triumphant only by superior pow'r.
6150	Or come now, I myself will judgment give;
6150	Nor deem I any Greek will find to blame
6150	In my decision, for 'tis fair and just.
6150	Antilochus, come forward, noble chief;
6150	And standing, as 'tis meet, before the car
6150	And horses, in thy hand the slender whip
6150	Wherewith thou drov'st, upon the horses lay
6150	Thy hand, and by Earth-shaking Neptune swear
6150	That not of malice, and by set design,
6150	"Thou didst by fraud impede my chariot's course."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Antilochus with prudent speech:
6150	"""Have patience with me yet; for I, O King,"
6150	O Menelaus, am thy junior far;
6150	My elder and superior thee I own.
6150	Thou know'st th' o'er-eager vehemence of youth,
6150	How quick in temper, and in judgment weak.
6150	Set then thy heart at ease; the mare I won
6150	I freely give; and if aught else of mine
6150	Thou shouldst desire, would sooner give it all,
6150	Than all my life be low'r'd, illustrious King,
6150	"In thine esteem, and sin against the Gods."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, noble Nestor's son led forth,
6150	And plac'd in Menelaus' hands the mare:
6150	The monarch's soul was melted, like the dew
6150	Which glitters on the ears of growing corn,
6150	That bristle o'er the plain; e'en so thy soul,
6150	O Menelaus, melted at his speech;
6150	To whom were thus address'd thy winged words:
6150	""
6150	"""Antilochus, at once I lay aside"
6150	My anger; thou art prudent, and not apt
6150	To be thus led astray; but now thy youth
6150	Thy judgment hath o'erpow'r'd; seek not henceforth
6150	By trick'ry o'er thine elders to prevail.
6150	To any other man of all the Greeks
6150	I scarce so much had yielded; but for that
6150	Thyself hast labour'd much, and much endur'd,
6150	Thou, thy good sire, and brother, in my cause:
6150	I yield me to thy pray'rs; and give, to boot,
6150	The mare, though mine of right; that these may know
6150	"I am not of a harsh, unyielding mood."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and to Noemon gave in charge,
6150	The faithful comrade of Antilochus,
6150	The mare; himself the glitt'ring caldron took.
6150	Of gold two talents, to the fourth assign'd,
6150	Fourth in the race, Meriones receiv'd;
6150	Still the fifth prize, a vase with double cup,
6150	Remain'd; Achilles this to Nestor gave,
6150	Before th' assembled Greeks, as thus he spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Take this, old man, and for an heirloom keep,"
6150	In mem'ry of Patroclus' fun'ral games,
6150	Whom thou no more amid the Greeks shalt see.
6150	Freely I give it thee; for thou no more
6150	Canst box, or wrestle, or in sportive strife
6150	The jav'lin throw, or race with flying feet;
6150	"For age with heavy hand hath bow'd thee down."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and plac'd it in his hand; th' old man
6150	Beceiv'd with joy the gift, and thus replied:
6150	""
6150	"""All thou hast said, my son, is simple truth:"
6150	No firmness now my limbs and feet retain,
6150	Nor can my arms with freedom, as of old,
6150	Straight from the shoulder, right and left, strike out.
6150	Oh that such youth and vigour yet were mine,
6150	As when th' Epeians in Buprasium held
6150	The royal Amarynceus' fun'ral games,
6150	And when the monarch's sons his prizes gave!
6150	Then could not one of all th' Epeian race,
6150	Or Pylians, or AEtolians, vie with me.
6150	In boxing, Clytomedes, OEnops' son,
6150	I vanquished; then Anchaeus, who stood up
6150	To wrestle with me, I with ease o'erthrew;
6150	Iphiclus I outran, though fleet of foot;
6150	In hurling with the spear, with Phyleus strove,
6150	And Polydorus, and surpass'd them both.
6150	The sons of Actor in the chariot-race
6150	Alone o'ercame me; as in number more,                           [8]
6150	And grudging more my triumph, since remain'd,
6150	This contest to reward, the richest prize.
6150	They were twin brothers; one who held the reins,
6150	Still drove, and drove; the other plied the whip.
6150	Such was I once; but now must younger men
6150	Engage in deeds like these; and I, the chief
6150	Of heroes once, must bow to weary age.
6150	But honour thou with fitting fun'ral games
6150	Thy comrade: I accept, well-pleas'd, thy gift,
6150	My heart rejoicing that thou still retain'st
6150	Of me a kindly mem'ry, nor o'erlook'st
6150	The place of honour, which among the Greeks
6150	Belongs to me of right; for this, the Gods
6150	"Reward thee with a worthy recompense!"""
6150	""
6150	He said; Achilles listen'd to the praise
6150	Of Neleus' son; then join'd the gen'ral throng.
6150	Next, he set forth the prizes, to reward
6150	The labours of the sturdy pugilists;
6150	A hardy mule he tether'd in the ring,
6150	Unbroken, six years old, most hard to tame;
6150	And for the vanquished man, a double cup;
6150	Then rose, and to the Greeks proclaim'd aloud:
6150	""
6150	"""Thou son of Atreus, and ye well-greav'd Greeks,"
6150	For these we bid two champions brave stand forth.
6150	And in the boxer's manly toil contend;
6150	And he, whose stern endurance Phoebus crowns
6150	With vict'ry, recogniz'd by all the Greeks,
6150	He to his tent shall lead the hardy mule;
6150	"The loser shall the double cup receive."""
6150	""
6150	He said; up sprang Epeius, tall and stout,
6150	A boxer skill'd, the son of Panopeus,
6150	Who laid his hand upon the mule, and said:
6150	""
6150	"""Stand forth, if any care the cup to win;"
6150	The mule, methinks, no Greek can bear away
6150	From me, who glory in the champion's name.
6150	Is't not enough, that in the battle-field
6150	I claim no special praise? 'tis not for man
6150	In all things to excel; but this I say,
6150	And will make good my words, who meets me here,
6150	I mean to pound his flesh, and smash his bones.
6150	See that his seconds be at hand, and prompt
6150	"To bear him from the ring, by me subdued."""
6150	""
6150	He said; they all in silence heard his speech:
6150	Only Euryalus, a godlike chief,
6150	Son of Mecistheus, Talaion's son,
6150	Stood forth opposing; he had once in Thebes
6150	Join'd in the fun'ral games of OEdipus,
6150	And there had vanquish'd all of Cadmian race.
6150	On him attended valiant Diomed,
6150	With cheering words, and wishes of success.
6150	Around his waist he fasten'd first the belt,
6150	Then gave the well-cut gauntlets for his hands.
6150	Of wild bull's hide. When both were thus equipp'd,
6150	Into the centre of the ring they stepp'd:
6150	There, face to face, with sinewy arms uprais'd,
6150	They stood awhile, then clos'd; strong hand with hand
6150	Mingling, in rapid interchange of blows.
6150	Dire was the clatter of their jaws; the sweat
6150	Pour'd forth, profuse, from ev'ry limb; then rush'd
6150	Epeius on, and full upon the cheek,
6150	Half turn'd aside, let fall a stagg'ring blow;
6150	Nor stood Euryalus; but, legs and feet
6150	Knock'd from beneath him, prone to earth he fell;
6150	And as a fish, that flounders on the sand,
6150	Thrown by rude Boreas on the weedy beach,
6150	Till cover'd o'er by the returning wave;
6150	So flounder'd he beneath that stunning blow.
6150	But brave Epeius took him by the hand,
6150	And rais'd him up; his comrades crowded round
6150	And bore him from the field, with dragging steps,
6150	Spitting forth clotted gore, his heavy head
6150	Rolling from side to side; within his tent
6150	They laid him down, unconscious; to the ring
6150	Then back returning, bore away the cup.
6150	""
6150	Achilles next before the Greeks display'd
6150	The prizes of the hardy wrestlers' skill:
6150	The victor's prize, a tripod vast, fire-proof,
6150	And at twelve oxen by the Greeks apprais'd;
6150	And for the vanquish'd man, a female slave
6150	Pric'd at four oxen, skill'd in household work.
6150	Then rose, and loudly to the Greeks proclaim'd,
6150	"""Stand forth, whoe'er this contest will essay."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and straight uprose the giant form
6150	Of Ajax Telamon; with him uprose
6150	Ulysses, skill'd in ev'ry crafty wile.
6150	Girt with the belt, within the ring they stood,
6150	And each, with stalwart grasp, laid hold on each;
6150	As stand two rafters of a lofty house,
6150	Each propping each, by skilful architect
6150	Design'd the tempest's fury to withstand.
6150	Creak'd their backbones beneath the tug and strain
6150	Of those strong arms; their sweat pour'd down like rain;
6150	And bloody weals of livid purple hue
6150	Their sides and shoulders streak'd, as sternly they
6150	For vict'ry and the well-wrought tripod strove.
6150	Nor could Ulysses Ajax overthrow,
6150	Nor Ajax bring Ulysses to the ground,
6150	So stubbornly he stood; but when the Greeks
6150	Were weary of the long-protracted strife,
6150	Thus to Ulysses mighty Ajax spoke:
6150	"""Ulysses sage, Laertes' godlike son,"
6150	Or lift thou me, or I will thee uplift:
6150	"The issue of our struggle rests with Jove."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and rais'd Ulysses from the ground;
6150	Nor he his ancient craft remember'd not,
6150	But lock'd his leg around, and striking sharp
6150	Upon the hollow of the knee, the joint
6150	Gave way; the giant Ajax backwards fell,
6150	Ulysses on his breast; the people saw,
6150	And marvell'd. Then in turn Ulysses strove
6150	Ajax to lift; a little way he mov'd,
6150	But fail'd to lift him fairly from, the ground;
6150	Yet crook'd his knee, that both together fell,
6150	And side by side, defil'd with dust, they lay.
6150	""
6150	And now a third encounter had they tried
6150	But rose Achilles, and the combat stay'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Forbear, nor waste your strength, in farther strife;"
6150	Ye both are victors; both then bear away
6150	An equal meed of honour; and withdraw,
6150	"That other Greeks may other contests wage."""
6150	Thus spoke Achilles: they his words obey'd,
6150	And brushing off the dust, their garments donn'd.
6150	""
6150	The prizes of the runners, swift of foot,
6150	Achilles next set forth; a silver bowl,
6150	Six measures its content, for workmanship
6150	Unmatch'd on earth, of Sidon's costliest art
6150	The product rare; thence o'er the misty sea
6150	Brought by Phoenicians, who, in port arriv'd,
6150	Gave it to Thoas; by Euneus last,
6150	The son of Jason, to Patroclus paid,
6150	In ransom of Lycaon, Priam's son;
6150	Which now Achilles, on his friend's behalf,
6150	Assign'd as his reward, whoe'er should prove
6150	The lightest foot, and speediest in the race.
6150	A steer, well fatten'd, was the second prize,
6150	And half a talent, for the third, of gold.
6150	He rose, and to the Greeks proclaim'd aloud,
6150	"""Stand forth, whoe'er this contest will essay."""
6150	He said: uprose Oileus' active son;
6150	Uprose Ulysses, skill'd in ev'ry wile,
6150	And noble Nestor's son, Antilochus,
6150	Who all the youth in speed of foot surpass'd.
6150	They stood in line: Achilles pointed out
6150	The limits of the course; as from the goal
6150	They stretch'd them to the race, Oileus' son
6150	First shot ahead; Ulysses following close;
6150	Nor farther than the shuttle from the breast
6150	Of some fair woman, when her outstretch'd arm
6150	Has thrown the woof athwart the warp, and back
6150	Withdraws it tow'rd her breast; so close behind
6150	Ulysses press'd on Ajax, and his feet
6150	Trod in his steps, ere settled yet the dust.
6150	His breath was on his shoulders, as the plain
6150	He lightly skimm'd; the Greeks with eager shouts
6150	Still cheering, as he strain'd to win the prize.
6150	But as they near'd the goal, Ulysses thus
6150	To blue-ey'd Pallas made his mental pray'r:
6150	"""Now hear me, Goddess, and my feet befriend."""
6150	Thus as he pray'd, his pray'r the Goddess heard,
6150	And all his limbs with active vigour fill'd;
6150	And, as they stretch'd their hands to seize the prize,
6150	Tripp'd up by Pallas, Ajax slipp'd and fell,
6150	Amid the offal of the lowing kine
6150	Which o'er Patroclus Peleus' son had slain.
6150	His mouth and nostrils were with offal fill'd.
6150	First in the race, Ulysses bore away
6150	The silver bowl; the steer to Ajax fell;
6150	And as upon the horn he laid his hand,
6150	Sputt'ring the offal out, he call'd aloud:
6150	"""Lo, how the Goddess has my steps bewray'd,"
6150	"Who guards Ulysses with a mother's care."""
6150	Thus as he spoke, loud laugh'd the merry Greeks.
6150	Antilochus the sole remaining prize
6150	Receiv'd, and, laughing, thus the Greeks address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""I tell you, friends, but what yourselves do know,"
6150	How of the elder men th' immortal Gods
6150	Take special care; for Ajax' years not much
6150	Exceed mine own; but here we see a man,
6150	One of a former age, and race of men;
6150	A hale old man we call him; but for speed
6150	"Not one can match him, save Achilles' self."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he, with praise implied of Peleus' son;
6150	To whom in answer thus Achilles spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Antilochus, not unobserv'd of me"
6150	Nor unrewarded shall thy praise remain:
6150	"To thy half talent add this second half."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, in his hand he plac'd the gold;
6150	Antilochus with joy the gift receiv'd.
6150	""
6150	Next, in the ring the son of Peleus laid
6150	A pond'rous spear, a helmet, and a shield,
6150	The spoil Patroclus from Sarpedon won;
6150	Then rose, and loudly to the Greeks proclaim'd:
6150	""
6150	"""For these we call upon two champions brave"
6150	To don their arms, their sharp-edg'd weapons grasp,
6150	And public trial of their prowess make;
6150	And he who first his rival's flesh shall reach,
6150	And, through his armour piercing, first draw blood,
6150	He shall this silver-studded sword receive,
6150	My trophy from Asteropaeus won,
6150	Well-wrought, of Thracian metal; but the arms
6150	In common property they both shall hold,
6150	"And in my tent a noble banquet share."""
6150	""
6150	He said; uprose great Ajax Telamon,
6150	And Tydeus' son, the valiant Diomed.
6150	First, from the crowd apart, they donn'd their arms;
6150	Then, eager for the fight, with haughty stare
6150	Stood in the midst; the Greeks admiring gaz'd.
6150	When, each approaching other, near they came,
6150	Thrice rush'd they on, and thrice in combat clos'd.
6150	Then through the buckler round of Diomed
6150	Great Ajax drove his spear; nor reach'd the point
6150	Tydides' body, by the breastplate stay'd:
6150	While, aim'd above the mighty shield's defence,
6150	His glitt'ring weapon flash'd at Ajax' throat.
6150	For Ajax fearing, shouted then the Greeks
6150	To cease the fight, and share alike the prize;
6150	But from Achilles' hand the mighty sword,
6150	With belt and scabbard, Diomed receiv'd.
6150	""
6150	Next in the ring the son of Peleus plac'd
6150	A pond'rous mass of iron, as a quoit
6150	Once wielded by Eetion's giant strength,
6150	But to the ships with other trophies borne,
6150	When by Achilles' hand Eetion fell.
6150	Then rose, and loudly to the Greeks proclaim'd:
6150	"""Stand forth, whoe'er this contest will essay."
6150	This prize who wins, though widely may extend
6150	His fertile fields, for five revolving years
6150	It will his wants supply; nor to the town
6150	For lack of iron, with this mass in store,
6150	"Need he his shepherd or his ploughman send."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and valiant Polypoetes rose,
6150	Epeius, and Leonteus' godlike strength,
6150	And mighty Ajax, son of Telamon.
6150	In turns they took their stand; Epeius first
6150	Uprais'd the pond'rous mass, and through the air
6150	Hurl'd it, amid the laughter of the Greeks.
6150	Next came Leonteus, scion true of Mars;
6150	The third was Ajax; from whose stalwart hand
6150	Beyond the farthest mark the missile flew.
6150	But when the valiant Polypoetes took
6150	The quoit in hand, far as a herdsman throws
6150	His staff, that, whirling, flies among the herd;
6150	So far beyond the ring's extremest bound
6150	He threw the pond'rous mass; loud were the shouts;
6150	And noble Polypoetes' comrades rose,
6150	And to the ships the monarch's gift convey'd.
6150	""
6150	The archers' prizes next, of iron hoar,
6150	Ten sturdy axes, double-edg'd, he plac'd,
6150	And single hatchets ten; then far away
6150	Rear'd on the sand a dark-prow'd vessel's mast,
6150	On which, with slender string, a tim'rous dove
6150	Was fasten'd by the foot, the archers' mark;
6150	That who should strike the dove should to his tent
6150	The axes bear away; but who the string
6150	Should sever, but should fail to strike the bird,
6150	As less in skill, the hatchets should receive.
6150	Thus spoke Achilles; straight uprose the might
6150	Of royal Teucer, and Meriones,
6150	The faithful follower of Idomeneus.
6150	They in a brass-bound helmet shook the lots.
6150	The first was Teucer's; with impetuous force
6150	He shot; but vow'd not to the Archer-King
6150	Of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb.
6150	The dove he struck not, for the Archer-God
6150	Withheld his aid; but close beside her foot
6150	The arrow sever'd the retaining string.
6150	The bird releas'd, soar'd heav'nward; while the string
6150	Dropp'd, from the mast suspended, tow'rds the earth,
6150	And loudly shouted their applause the Greeks.
6150	Then snatch'd Meriones in haste the bow
6150	From Teucer's hand; his own already held
6150	His arrow, pointed straight; he drew the string,
6150	And to the far-destroying King he vow'd
6150	Of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb.
6150	Aloft amid the clouds he mark'd the dove,
6150	And struck her, as she soar'd, beneath the wing;
6150	Right through the arrow pass'd; and to the earth
6150	Returning, fell beside Meriones.
6150	The bird upon the dark-prow'd vessel's mast
6150	Lighted awhile; anon, with drooping head,
6150	And pinions flutt'ring vain, afar she fell,
6150	Lifeless; th' admiring crowd with wonder gaz'd.
6150	Meriones the axes bore away,
6150	While Teucer to the ships the hatchets bore.
6150	""
6150	Last, in the ring the son of Peleus laid
6150	A pond'rous spear, and caldron, burnish'd bright,
6150	Pric'd at an ox's worth, untouch'd by fire,
6150	For those who with the jav'lin would contend.
6150	Uprose then Agamemnon, King of men,
6150	The son of Atreus, and Meriones,
6150	The faithful follower of Idomeneus:
6150	But Peleus' godlike son address'd them thus:
6150	""
6150	"""How far, Atrides, thou excell'st us all,"
6150	And with the jav'lin what thy pow'r and skill
6150	Pre-eminent, we know; take thou this prize,
6150	And bear it to thy ships; and let us give
6150	To brave Meriones the brazen spear;
6150	"If so it please thee, such were my advice."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and Agamemnon, King of men,
6150	Assenting, gave to brave Meriones
6150	The brazen spear; while in Talthybius' care,
6150	His herald, plac'd the King his noble prize.

6150	ARGUMENT.
6150	""
6150	THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector's body. Jupiter
6150	sends Thetis to Achilles to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris
6150	to Priam, to encourage him to go in person, and treat for it. The old
6150	king, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for
6150	the journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He sets
6150	forth in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the
6150	charge of Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young
6150	man, and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation
6150	on the way* Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his
6150	feet, and begs for the body of his son; Achilles, moved with
6150	compassion, grants his request, detains him one night in his tent, and
6150	the next morning sends him home with the body; the Trojans run out to
6150	meet him. The lamentation of Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the
6150	solemnities of the funeral.
6150	""
6150	The time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of
6150	Hector lies in the tent of Achilles. And as many more are spent in the
6150	truce allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles' camp,
6150	and partly in Troy.

6150	BOOK XXIV.
6150	""
6150	""
6150	The games were ended, and the multitude
6150	Amid the ships their sev'ral ways dispers'd:
6150	Some to their supper, some to gentle sleep
6150	Yielding, delighted; but Achilles still
6150	Mourn'd o'er his lov'd companion; not on him
6150	Lighted all-conqu'ring sleep, but to and fro
6150	Restless he toss'd, and on Patroclus thought,
6150	His vigour and his courage; all the deeds
6150	They two together had achiev'd; the toils,
6150	The perils they had undergone, amid
6150	The strife of warriors, and the angry waves.
6150	Stirr'd by such mem'ries, bitter tears he shed;
6150	Now turning on his side, and now again
6150	Upon his back; then prone upon his face;
6150	Then starting to his feet, along the shore
6150	All objectless, despairing, would he roam;
6150	Nor did the morn, above the sea appearing,
6150	Unmark'd of him arise; his flying steeds
6150	He then would harness, and, behind the car
6150	The corpse of Hector trailing in the dust,
6150	Thrice make the circuit of Patroclus' tomb;
6150	Then would he turn within his tent to rest,
6150	Leaving the prostrate corpse with dust defil'd;
6150	But from unseemly marks the valiant dead
6150	Apollo guarded, who with pity view'd
6150	The hero, though in death; and round him threw
6150	His golden aegis; nor, though dragg'd along,
6150	Allow'd his body to receive a wound.
6150	""
6150	Thus foully did Achilles in his rage
6150	Misuse the mighty dead; the blessed Gods
6150	With pitying grief beheld the sight, and urg'd
6150	That Hermes should by stealth the corpse remove.
6150	The counsel pleas'd the rest; but Juno still,
6150	And Neptune, and the blue-ey'd Maid, retain'd
6150	The hatred, unappeas'd, with which of old
6150	Troy and her King and people they pursued;
6150	Since Paris to the rival Goddesses,
6150	Who to his sheepfold came, gave deep offence,
6150	Preferring her who brought him in return
6150	The fatal boon of too successful love.
6150	But when the twelfth revolving day was come,
6150	Apollo thus th' assembled Gods address'd:
6150	"""Shame on ye, Gods, ungrateful! have ye not,"
6150	At Hector's hand, of bulls and choicest goats
6150	Receiv'd your off'rings meet? and fear ye now
6150	E'en his dead corpse to save, and grant his wife,
6150	His mother, and his child, his aged sire
6150	And people, to behold him, and to raise
6150	His fun'ral pile, and with due rites entomb?
6150	But fell Achilles all your aid commands;
6150	Of mind unrighteous, and inflexible
6150	His stubborn heart; his thoughts are all of blood;
6150	E'en as a lion, whom his mighty strength
6150	And dauntless courage lead to leap the fold,
6150	And 'mid the trembling flocks to seize his prey;
6150	E'en so Achilles hath discarded ruth,
6150	And conscience, arbiter of good and ill.
6150	A man may lose his best-lov'd friend, a son,
6150	Or his own mother's son, a brother dear:
6150	He mourns and weeps, but time his grief allays,
6150	For fate to man a patient mind hath giv'n:
6150	But godlike Hector's body, after death,
6150	Achilles, unrelenting, foully drags,
6150	Lash'd to his car, around his comrade's tomb.
6150	This is not to his praise; though brave he be,
6150	Yet thus our anger he may justly rouse,
6150	"Who in his rage insults the senseless clay."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, indignant, white-arm'd Juno thus:
6150	"""Some show of reason were there in thy speech,"
6150	God of the silver bow, could Hector boast
6150	Of equal dignity with Peleus' son.
6150	A mortal one, and nurs'd at woman's breast;
6150	The other, of a Goddess born, whom I
6150	Nurtur'd and rear'd, and to a mortal gave
6150	In marriage; gave to Peleus, best belov'd
6150	By all th' Immortals, of the race of man.
6150	Ye, Gods, attended all the marriage rites;
6150	Thou too, companion base, false friend, wast there,
6150	"And, playing on thy lyre, didst share the feast."""
6150	""
6150	To whom the Cloud-compeller answer'd thus:
6150	"""Juno, restrain thy wrath; they shall not both"
6150	Attain like honour; yet was Hector once,
6150	Of all the mortals that in Ilium dwell,
6150	Dearest to all the Gods, and chief to me;
6150	For never did he fail his gifts to bring.
6150	And with, burnt-off 'rings and libations due
6150	My altars crown; such worship I receiv'd.
6150	Yet shall bold Hector's body, not without
6150	The knowledge of Achilles, be remov'd;
6150	For day and night his Goddess-mother keeps
6150	Her constant watch beside him. Then, some God
6150	Bid Thetis hither to my presence haste;
6150	And I with prudent words will counsel her,
6150	That so Achilles may at Priam's hand
6150	"Large ransom take, and set brave Hector free."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and promptly on his errand sprang
6150	The storm-swift Iris; in the dark-blue sea
6150	She plung'd, midway 'twixt Imbros' rugged shore
6150	And Samos' isle; the parting waters plash'd.
6150	As down to ocean's lowest depths she dropp'd,
6150	Like to a plummet, which the fisherman
6150	Lets fall, encas'd in wild bull's horn, to bear
6150	Destruction to the sea's voracious tribes.
6150	There found she Thetis in a hollow cave,
6150	Around her rang'd the Ocean Goddesses:
6150	She, in the midst, was weeping o'er the fate
6150	Her matchless son awaiting, doom'd to die
6150	Far from his home, on fertile plains of Troy.
6150	Swift-footed Iris at her side appear'd,
6150	"And thus address'd her: ""Hasten, Thetis; Jove,"
6150	"Lord of immortal counsel, summons thee."""
6150	To whom the silver-footed Goddess thus:
6150	"""What would with me the mighty King of Heav'n?"
6150	Press'd as I am with grief, I am asham'd
6150	To mingle with the Gods; yet will I go:
6150	"Nor shall he speak in vain, whate'er his words."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as she spoke, her veil the Goddess took,
6150	All black, than which none deeper could be found;
6150	She rose to go; the storm-swift Iris led
6150	The way before her; ocean's parted waves
6150	Around their path receded; to the beach
6150	Ascending, upwards straight to Heav'n they sprang.
6150	Th' all-seeing son of Saturn there they found,
6150	And rang'd around him all th' immortal Gods.
6150	Pallas made way; and by the throne of Jove
6150	Sat Thetis, Juno proff'ring to her hand
6150	A goblet fair of gold, and adding words
6150	Of welcome; she the cup receiv'd, and drank.
6150	Then thus began the sire of Gods and men:
6150	"""Thou, Thetis, sorrowing to Olympus com'st,"
6150	Borne down by ceaseless grief; I know it well;
6150	Yet hear the cause for which I summon'd thee.
6150	About Achilles, thy victorious son,
6150	And valiant Hector's body, for nine days
6150	Hath contest been in Heav'n; and some have urg'd
6150	That Hermes should by stealth the corpse remove.
6150	This to Achilles' praise I mean to turn,
6150	And thus thy rev'rence and thy love retain.
6150	Then haste thee to the camp, and to thy son
6150	My message bear; tell him that all the Gods
6150	Are fill'd with wrath; and I above the rest
6150	Am angry, that beside the beaked ships,
6150	He, mad with rage, the corpse of Hector keeps:
6150	So may he fear me, and restore the dead.
6150	Iris meantime to Priam I will send,
6150	And bid him seek the Grecian ships, and there
6150	Obtain his son's release: and with him bring
6150	"Such presents as may melt Achilles' heart."""
6150	""
6150	He said; the silver-footed Queen obey'd;
6150	Down from Olympus' heights in haste she sped,
6150	And sought her son; him found she in his tent,
6150	Groaning with anguish, while his comrades round,
6150	Plying their tasks, prepar'd the morning meal.
6150	For them a goodly sheep, full-fleec'd, was slain.
6150	Close by his side his Goddess-mother stood,
6150	And gently touch'd him with her hand, and said,
6150	"""How long, my son, wilt thou thy soul consume"
6150	With grief and mourning, mindful nor of food
6150	Nor sleep? nor dost thou wisely, to abstain
6150	From woman's love; for short thy time on earth:
6150	Death and imperious fate are close at hand.
6150	Hear then my words; a messenger from Jove
6150	To thee I come, to tell thee that the Gods
6150	Are fill'd with wrath, and he above the rest
6150	Is angry, that beside the beaked ships
6150	Thou, mad with rage, the corpse of Hector keep'st.
6150	"Then ransom take, and liberate the dead."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Achilles, swift of foot, replied:
6150	"""So be it; ransom let him bring, and bear"
6150	"His dead away, if such the will of Jove."""
6150	""
6150	Thus, in the concourse of the ships, they two,
6150	Mother and son, their lengthen'd converse held.
6150	""
6150	Then Saturn's son to Iris gave command:
6150	"""Haste thee, swift Iris, from Olympus' height,"
6150	To Troy, to royal Priam bear my words;
6150	And bid him seek the Grecian ships, and there
6150	Obtain his son's release; and with him take
6150	Such presents as may melt Achilles' heart.
6150	Alone, no Trojan with him, must he go;
6150	Yet may a herald on his steps attend,
6150	Some aged man, his smoothly-rolling car
6150	And mules to drive; and to the city back
6150	To bring his dead, whom great Achilles slew.
6150	Nor let the fear of death disturb his mind:
6150	Hermes shall with him, as his escort, go,
6150	And to Achilles' presence safely bring.
6150	Arriv'd within the tent, nor he himself
6150	Will slay him, but from others will protect.
6150	Not ignorant is he, nor void of sense,
6150	Nor disobedient to the Gods' behest
6150	"But will with pitying eyes his suppliant view."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and on his errand sped in haste
6150	The storm-swift Iris; when to Priam's house
6150	She came, the sounds of wailing met her ear.
6150	Within the court, around their father, sat
6150	His sons, their raiment all bedew'd with tears;
6150	And in the midst, close cover'd with his robe,
6150	Their sire, his head and neck with dirt defil'd,
6150	Which, wallowing on the earth, himself had heap'd,
6150	With his own hands, upon his hoary head.
6150	Throughout the house his daughters loudly wail'd
6150	In mem'ry of the many and the brave
6150	Who lay in death, by Grecian warriors slain.
6150	Beside him stood the messenger of Jove,
6150	And whisper'd, while his limbs with terror shook:
6150	"""Fear nothing, Priam, son of Dardanus,"
6150	Nor let thy mind be troubled; not for ill,
6150	But here on kindly errand am I sent:
6150	To thee I come, a messenger from Jove,
6150	Who from on high looks down on thee with eyes
6150	Of pitying love; he bids thee ransom home
6150	The godlike Hector's corpse; and with thee take
6150	Such presents as may melt Achilles' heart.
6150	Alone, no Trojan with thee, must thou go;

6150	Swift-footed Iris said, and vanish'd straight:
6150	He to his sons commandment gave, the mules
6150	To yoke beneath the smoothly-rolling car,
6150	And on the axle fix the wicker seat.
6150	Himself the lofty cedar chamber sought,
6150	Fragrant, high-roof'd, with countless treasures stor'd;
6150	And call'd to Hecuba his wife, and said,
6150	"""Good wife, a messenger from Jove hath come,"
6150	Who bids me seek the Grecian ships, and there
6150	Obtain my son's release; and with me take
6150	Such presents as may melt Achilles' heart.
6150	Say then, what think'st thou? for my mind inclines
6150	"To seek the ships within the Grecian camp."""
6150	""
6150	So he; but Hecuba lamenting cried,
6150	"""Alas, alas! where are thy senses gone?"
6150	And where the wisdom, once of high repute
6150	'Mid strangers, and 'mid those o'er whom thou reign'st?
6150	How canst thou think alone to seek the ships,
6150	Ent'ring his presence, who thy sons hath slain,
6150	Many and brave? an iron heart is thine!
6150	Of that bloodthirsty and perfidious man,
6150	If thou within the sight and reach shalt come,
6150	No pity will he feel, no rev'rence show:
6150	Rather remain we here apart and mourn;
6150	For him, when at his birth his thread of life
6150	Was spun by fate, 'twas destin'd that afar
6150	From home and parents, he should glut the maw
6150	Of rav'ning dogs, by that stern warrior's tent,
6150	Whose inmost heart I would I could devour:
6150	Such for my son were adequate revenge,
6150	Whom not in ignominious flight he slew;
6150	But standing, thoughtless of escape or flight,
6150	"For Trojan men and Troy's deep-bosom'd dames."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:
6150	"""Seek not to hinder me; nor be thyself"
6150	A bird of evil omen in my house;
6150	For thou shalt not persuade me. If indeed
6150	This message had been brought by mortal man,
6150	Prophet, or seer, or sacrificing priest,
6150	I should have deem'd it false, and laugh'd to scorn
6150	The idle tale; but now (for I myself
6150	Both saw and heard the Goddess) I must go;
6150	Nor unfulfill'd shall be the words I speak:
6150	And if indeed it be my fate to die
6150	Beside the vessels of the brass-clad Greeks,
6150	I am content! by fierce Achilles' hand
6150	Let me be slain, so once more in my arms
6150	"I hold my boy, and give my sorrow vent."""
6150	Then raising up the coffer's polish'd lid,
6150	He chose twelve gorgeous shawls, twelve single cloaks.
6150	As many rugs, as many splendid robes,
6150	As many tunics; then of gold he took
6150	Ten talents full; two tripods, burnish'd bright,
6150	Four caldrons; then a cup of beauty rare,
6150	A rich possession, which the men of Thrace
6150	Had giv'n, when there he went ambassador;
6150	E'en this he spar'd not, such his keen desire
6150	His son to ransom. From the corridor
6150	With angry words he drove the Trojans all:
6150	""
6150	"""Out with ye, worthless rascals, vagabonds!"
6150	Have ye no griefs at home, that here ye come
6150	To pester me? or is it not enough
6150	That Jove with deep affliction visits me,
6150	Slaying my bravest son? ye to your cost
6150	Shall know his loss: since now that he is gone,
6150	The Greeks shall find you easier far to slay.
6150	But may my eyes be clos'd in death, ere see
6150	"The city sack'd, and utterly destroy'd."""
6150	""
6150	He said, and with his staff drove out the crowd;
6150	Before the old man's anger fled they all;
6150	Then to his sons in threat'ning tone he cried;
6150	To Paris, Helenus, and Agathon,
6150	Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites brave,
6150	Deiphobus, and bold Hippothous,
6150	And godlike Dius; all these nine with threats
6150	And angry taunts the aged sire assail'd:
6150	"""Haste, worthless sons, my scandal and my shame!"
6150	Would that ye all beside the Grecian ships
6150	In Hector's stead had died! Oh woe is me,
6150	Who have begotten sons, in all the land
6150	The best and bravest; now remains not one;
6150	Mestor, and Troilus, dauntless charioteer,
6150	And Hector, who a God 'mid men appear'd,
6150	Nor like a mortal's offspring, but a God's:
6150	All these hath Mars cut off; and left me none,
6150	None but the vile and refuse; liars all,
6150	Vain skipping coxcombs, in the dance alone,
6150	And in nought else renown'd; base plunderers,
6150	From their own countrymen, of lambs and kids.
6150	When, laggards, will ye harness me the car
6150	"Equipp'd with all things needed for the way?"""
6150	""
6150	He said; they quail'd beneath their father's wrath,
6150	And brought the smoothly-running mule-wain out,
6150	Well-fram'd, new-built; and fix'd the wicker seat;
6150	Then from the peg the mule-yoke down they took,
6150	Of boxwood wrought, with boss and rings complete;
6150	And with the yoke, the yoke-band brought they forth,
6150	Nine cubits long; and to the polish'd pole
6150	At the far end attach'd; the breast-rings then
6150	Fix'd to the pole-piece: and on either side
6150	Thrice round the knob the leathern thong they wound.
6150	And bound it fast, and inward turn'd the tongue.
6150	Then the rich ransom, from the chambers brought,
6150	Of Hector's head, upon the wain they pil'd;
6150	And yok'd the strong-hoof'd mules, to harness train'd,
6150	The Mysians' splendid present to the King:
6150	To Priam's car they harness'd then the steeds,
6150	Which he himself at polish'd manger fed.
6150	""
6150	Deep thoughts revolving, in the lofty halls
6150	Were met the herald and the aged King,
6150	When Hecuba with troubled mind drew near;
6150	In her right hand a golden cup she bore
6150	Of luscious wine, that ere they took their way
6150	They to the Gods might due libations pour;
6150	Before the car she stood, and thus she spoke:
6150	"""Take, and to father Jove thine off'ring pour,"
6150	And pray that he may bring thee safely home
6150	From all thy foes; since sore against my will
6150	Thou needs wilt venture to the ships of Greece.
6150	Then to Idaean Jove, the cloud-girt son
6150	Of Saturn, who th' expanse of Troy surveys,
6150	Prefer thy pray'r, beseeching him to send,
6150	On thy right hand, a winged messenger,
6150	The bird he loves the best, of strongest flight;
6150	That thou thyself mayst see and know the sign,
6150	And, firm in faith, approach the ships of Greece.
6150	But should all-seeing Jove the sign withhold,
6150	Then not with my consent shouldst thou attempt,
6150	"Whate'er thy wish, to reach the Grecian ships."""
6150	""
6150	To whom, in answer, godlike Priam thus:
6150	"""O woman, I refuse not to obey"
6150	Thy counsel; good it is to raise the hands
6150	"In pray'r to Heav'n, and Jove's protection seek."""
6150	The old man said; and bade th' attendant pour
6150	Pure water on his hands; with ewer she,
6150	And basin, stood beside him: from his wife,
6150	The due ablutions made, he took the cup;
6150	Then in the centre of the court he stood,
6150	And as he pour'd the wine, look'd up to Heav'n,
6150	And thus with voice uplifted pray'd aloud:
6150	"""O father Jove, who rul'st on Ida's height,"
6150	Most great, most glorious! grant that I may find
6150	Some pity in Achilles' heart; and send,
6150	On my right hand, a winged messenger,
6150	The bird thou lov'st the best, of strongest flight,
6150	That I myself may see and know the sign,
6150	"And, firm in faith, approach the ships of Greece."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he pray'd, the Lord of counsel heard;
6150	And sent forthwith an eagle, feather'd king,
6150	Dark bird of chase, and Dusky thence surnam'd:
6150	Wide as the portals, well secur'd with bolts,
6150	That guard some wealthy monarch's lofty hall,
6150	On either side his ample pinions spread.
6150	On the right hand appear'd he, far above
6150	The city soaring; they the fav'ring sign
6150	With joy beheld, and ev'ry heart was cheer'd.
6150	Mounting his car in haste, the aged King
6150	Drove thro' the court, and thro' the echoing porch;
6150	The mules in front, by sage Idaeus driv'n,
6150	That drew the four-wheel'd wain; behind them came
6150	The horses, down the city's steep descent
6150	Urg'd by th' old man to speed; the crowd of friends
6150	That follow'd mourn'd for him, as doom'd to death.
6150	Descended from the city to the plain,
6150	His sons and sons-in-law to Ilium took
6150	Their homeward way; advancing o'er the plain
6150	They two escap'd not Jove's all-seeing eye;
6150	Pitying he saw the aged sire; and thus
6150	At once to Hermes spoke, his much-lov'd son:
6150	"""Hermes, for thou in social converse lov'st"
6150	To mix with men, and hear'st whome'er thou wilt;
6150	Haste thee, and Priam to the Grecian ships
6150	So lead, that none of all the Greeks may see
6150	"Ere at Achilles' presence he attain."""
6150	""
6150	He said; nor disobey'd the heav'nly Guide;
6150	His golden sandals on his feet he bound,
6150	Ambrosial work; which bore him o'er the waves,
6150	Swift as the wind, and o'er the wide-spread earth;
6150	Then took his rod, wherewith he seals at will
6150	The eyes of men, and wakes again from sleep.
6150	This in his hand he bore, and sprang for flight.
6150	Soon the wide Hellespont he reach'd, and Troy,
6150	And pass'd in likeness of a princely youth,
6150	In op'ning manhood, fairest term of life.
6150	""
6150	The twain had pass'd by Ilus' lofty tomb,
6150	And halted there the horses and the mules
6150	Beside the margin of the stream to drink;
6150	For darkness now was creeping o'er the earth:
6150	When through the gloom the herald Hermes saw
6150	Approaching near, to Priam thus he cried:
6150	"""O son of Dardanus, bethink thee well;"
6150	Of prudent counsel great is now our need.
6150	A man I see, and fear he means us ill.
6150	Say, with the horses shall we fly at once,
6150	"Or clasp his knees, and for his mercy sue?"""
6150	The old man heard, his mind confus'd with dread;
6150	So grievously he fear'd, that ev'ry hair
6150	Upon his bended limbs did stand on end;
6150	He stood astounded; but the Guardian-God
6150	Approach'd, and took him by the hand, and said:
6150	"""Where, father, goest thou thus with horse and mule"
6150	In the still night, when men are sunk in sleep?
6150	And fear'st thou not the slaughter-breathing Greeks,
6150	Thine unrelenting foes, and they so near?
6150	If any one of them should see thee now,
6150	So richly laden in the gloom of night,
6150	How wouldst thou feel? thou art not young thyself,
6150	And this old man, thy comrade, would avail
6150	But little to protect thee from assault.
6150	I will not harm thee, nay will shield from harm,
6150	"For like my father's is, methinks, thy face."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:
6150	"""'Tis as thou say'st, fair son; yet hath some God"
6150	Extended o'er me his protecting hand,
6150	Who sends me such a guide, so opportune.
6150	Bless'd are thy parents in a son so grac'd
6150	"In face and presence, and of mind so wise."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer thus the Guardian-God:
6150	"""O father, well and wisely dost thou speak;"
6150	But tell me this, and truly: dost thou bear
6150	These wealthy treasures to some foreign land,
6150	That they for thee in safety may be stor'd?
6150	Or have ye all resolv'd to fly from Troy
6150	In fear, your bravest slain, thy gallant son,
6150	"Who never from the Greeks' encounter flinch'd?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:
6150	"""Who art thou, noble Sir, and what thy race,"
6150	"That speak'st thus fairly of my hapless son?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer thus the Guardian-God:
6150	"""Try me, old man; of godlike Hector ask;"
6150	For often in the glory-giving fight
6150	These eyes have seen him; chief, when to the ships
6150	The Greeks he drove, and with the sword destroy'd.
6150	We gaz'd in wonder; from the fight restrain'd
6150	By Peleus' son, with Agamemnon wroth.
6150	His follower I; one ship convey'd us both;
6150	One of the Myrmidons I am; my sire
6150	Polyctor, rich, but aged, e'en as thou.
6150	Six sons he hath, besides myself, the sev'nth;
6150	And I by lot was drafted for the war.
6150	I from the ships am to the plain come forth;
6150	For with the dawn of day the keen-ey'd Greeks
6150	Will round the city marshal their array.
6150	They chafe in idleness; the chiefs in vain
6150	"Strive to restrain their ardour for the fight."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:
6150	"""If of Achilles, Peleus' son, thou art"
6150	Indeed a follower, tell me all the truth;
6150	Lies yet my son beside the Grecian ships,
6150	Or hath Achilles torn him limb from limb,
6150	"And to his dogs the mangled carcase giv'n?"""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer thus the Guardian-God:
6150	"""On him, old man, nor dogs nor birds have fed,"
6150	But by the ship of Peleus' son he lies
6150	Within the tent; twelve days he there hath lain,
6150	Nor hath corruption touch'd his flesh, nor worms,
6150	That wont to prey on men in battle slain.
6150	The corpse, indeed, with each returning morn,
6150	Around his comrade's tomb Achilles drags,
6150	Yet leaves it still uninjur'd; thou thyself
6150	Mightst see how fresh, as dew-besprent, he lies,
6150	From blood-stains cleans'd, and clos'd his many wounds,
6150	For many a lance was buried in his corpse.
6150	So, e'en in death, the blessed Gods above,
6150	"Who lov'd him well, protect thy noble son."""
6150	""
6150	He said; th' old man rejoicing heard his words,
6150	"And answer'd, ""See, my son, how good it is"
6150	To give th' immortal Gods their tribute due;
6150	For never did my son, while yet he liv'd,
6150	Neglect the Gods who on Olympus dwell;
6150	And thence have they remember'd him in death.
6150	Accept, I pray, this goblet rich-emboss'd;
6150	Be thou my guard, and, under Heav'n, my guide,
6150	"Until I reach the tent of Peleus' son."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer thus the Guardian-God:
6150	"""Old father, me thy younger wouldst thou tempt,"
6150	In vain; who bidd'st me at thy hands accept
6150	Thy proffer'd presents, to Achilles' wrong.
6150	I dread his anger; and should hold it shame
6150	To plunder him, through fear of future ill.
6150	But, as thy guide, I could conduct thee safe,
6150	As far as Argos, journeying by thy side,
6150	On ship-board or on foot; nor by the fault
6150	"Of thy conductor shouldst thou meet with harm."""
6150	""
6150	Thus spoke the Guardian-God, and on the car
6150	Mounting in haste, he took the whip and reins,
6150	And with fresh vigour mules and horses fill'd.
6150	When to the ship-tow'rs and the trench they came,
6150	The guard had late been busied with their meal;
6150	And with deep sleep the heav'nly Guide o'erspread
6150	The eyes of all; then open'd wide the gates,
6150	And push'd aside the bolts, and led within
6150	Both Priam, and the treasure-laden wain.
6150	But when they reach'd Achilles' lofty tent,
6150	(Which for their King the Myrmidons had built
6150	Of fir-trees fell'd, and overlaid the roof
6150	With rushes mown from off the neighb'ring mead;
6150	And all around a spacious court enclos'd
6150	With cross-set palisades; a single bar
6150	Of fir the gateway guarded, which to shut
6150	Three men, of all the others, scarce suffic'd,
6150	And three to open; but Achilles' hand
6150	Unaided shut with ease the massive bar)
6150	Then for the old man Hermes op'd the gate,
6150	And brought within the court the gifts design'd
6150	For Peleus' godlike son; then from the car
6150	Sprang to the ground, and thus to Priam spoke:
6150	"""Old man, a God hath hither been thy guide;"
6150	Hermes I am, and sent to thee from Jove,
6150	Father of all, to bring thee safely here.
6150	I now return, nor to Achilles' eyes
6150	Will I appear; beseems it not a God
6150	To greet a mortal in the sight of all.
6150	But go thou in, and clasp Achilles' knees,
6150	And supplicate him for his father's sake,
6150	His fair-hair'd mother's, and his child's, that so
6150	"Thy words may stir an answer in his heart."""
6150	""
6150	Thus saying, Hermes to Olympus' heights
6150	Return'd; and Priam from his chariot sprang,
6150	And left Idaeus there, in charge to keep
6150	The horses and the mules, while he himself
6150	Enter'd the dwelling straight, where wont to sit
6150	Achilles, lov'd of Heav'n. The chief he found
6150	Within, his followers seated all apart;
6150	Two only in his presence minister'd,
6150	The brave Automedon, and Alcimus,
6150	A warrior bold; scarce ended the repast
6150	Of food and wine; the table still was set.
6150	Great Priam enter'd, unperceiv'd of all;
6150	And standing by Achilles, with his arms
6150	Embrac'd his knees, and kiss'd those fearful hands,
6150	Blood-stain'd, which many of his sons had slain.
6150	As when a man, by cruel fate pursued,
6150	In his own land hath shed another's blood,
6150	And flying, seeks beneath some wealthy house
6150	A foreign refuge; wond'ring, all behold:
6150	On godlike Priam so with wonder gaz'd
6150	Achilles; wonder seiz'd th' attendants all,
6150	And one to other looked; then Priam thus
6150	To Peleus' son his suppliant speech address'd:
6150	"""Think, great Achilles, rival of the Gods,"
6150	Upon thy father, e'en as I myself
6150	Upon the threshold of unjoyous age:
6150	And haply he, from them that dwell around
6150	May suffer wrong, with no protector near
6150	To give him aid; yet he, rejoicing, knows
6150	That thou still liv'st; and day by day may hope
6150	To see his son returning safe from Troy;
6150	While I, all hapless, that have many sons,
6150	The best and bravest through the breadth of Troy,
6150	Begotten, deem that none are left me now.
6150	Fifty there were, when came the sons of Greece;
6150	Nineteen the offspring of a single womb;
6150	The rest, the women of my household bore.
6150	Of these have many by relentless Mars
6150	Been laid in dust; but he, my only one,
6150	The city's and his brethren's sole defence,
6150	He, bravely fighting in his country's cause,
6150	Hector, but lately by thy hand hath fall'n:
6150	On his behalf I venture to approach
6150	The Grecian ships; for his release to thee
6150	To make my pray'r, and priceless ransom pay.
6150	Then thou, Achilles, reverence the Gods;
6150	And, for thy father's sake, look pitying down
6150	On me, more needing pity; since I bear
6150	Such grief as never man on earth hath borne.
6150	"Who stoop to kiss the hand that slew my son."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, within Achilles' breast
6150	Fond mem'ry of his father rose; he touch'd
6150	The old man's hand, and gently put him by;
6150	Then wept they both, by various mem'ries stirr'd:
6150	One, prostrate at Achilles' feet, bewail'd
6150	His warrior son; Achilles for his sire,
6150	And for Patroclus wept, his comrade dear;
6150	And through the house their weeping loud was heard.
6150	But when Achilles had indulg'd his grief,
6150	And eas'd the yearning of his heart and limbs,
6150	Uprising, with his hand the aged sire,
6150	Pitying his hoary head and hoary beard,
6150	He rais'd, and thus with gentle words address'd:
6150	""
6150	"""Alas, what sorrows, poor old man, are thine!"
6150	How couldst thou venture to the Grecian ships
6150	Alone, and to the presence of the man
6150	Whose hand hath slain so many of thy sons,
6150	Many and brave? an iron heart is thine!
6150	But sit thou on this seat; and in our hearts,
6150	Though filled with grief, let us that grief suppress;
6150	For woful lamentation nought avails.
6150	Such, is the thread the Gods for mortals spin,
6150	To live in woe, while they from cares are free.
6150	Two coffers lie beside the door of Jove,
6150	With gifts for man: one good, the other ill;
6150	To whom from each the Lord of lightning gives,
6150	Him sometimes evil, sometimes good befalls;
6150	To whom the ill alone, him foul disgrace
6150	And grinding mis'ry o'er the earth pursue:
6150	By God and man alike despis'd he roams.
6150	Thus from his birth the Gods to Peleus gave
6150	Excellent gifts; with wealth and substance bless'd
6150	Above his fellows; o'er the Myrmidons
6150	He rul'd with sov'reign sway; and Heav'n bestow'd
6150	On him, a mortal, an immortal bride.
6150	Yet this of ill was mingled in his lot,
6150	That in his house no rising race he saw
6150	Of future Kings; one only son he had,
6150	One doom'd to early death; nor is it mine
6150	To tend my father's age; but far from home
6150	Thee and thy sons in Troy I vex with war.
6150	Much have we heard too of thy former wealth;
6150	Above what Lesbos northward, Macar's seat,
6150	Contains, and Upper Phrygia, and the shores
6150	Of boundless Hellespont, 'tis said that thou
6150	In wealth and number of thy sons wast bless'd.
6150	But since on thee this curse the Gods have brought,
6150	Still round thy city war and murder rage.
6150	Bear up, nor thus with grief incessant mourn;
6150	Vain is thy sorrow for thy gallant son;
6150	"Thou canst not raise him, and mayst suffer more."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire;
6150	"""Tell me not yet, illustrious chief, to sit,"
6150	While Hector lies, uncar'd for, in the tent;
6150	But let me quickly go, that with mine eyes
6150	I may behold my son; and thou accept
6150	The ample treasures which we tender thee:
6150	Mayst thou enjoy them, and in safety reach
6150	Thy native land, since thou hast spar'd my life,
6150	"And bidd'st me still behold the light of Heav'n."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Achilles thus with stern regard:
6150	"""Old man, incense me not; I mean myself"
6150	To give thee back thy son; for here of late
6150	Despatch'd by Jove, my Goddess-mother came,
6150	The daughter of the aged Ocean-God:
6150	And thee too, Priam, well I know, some God
6150	(I cannot err) hath guided to our ships.
6150	No mortal, though in vent'rous youth, would dare
6150	Our camp to enter; nor could hope to pass
6150	Unnotic'd by the watch, nor easily
6150	Remove the pond'rous bar that guards our doors.
6150	But stir not up my anger in my grief;
6150	Lest, suppliant though thou be, within my tent
6150	"I brook thee not, and Jove's command transgress."""
6150	""
6150	He said; the old man trembled, and obey'd;
6150	Then to the door-way, with a lion's spring,
6150	Achilles rush'd; not unaccompanied;
6150	With him Automedon and Aleimus,
6150	His two attendants, of his followers all,
6150	Next to the lost Patroclus, best-esteem'd;
6150	They from the yoke the mules and horses loos'd;
6150	Then led the herald of the old man in,
6150	And bade him sit; and from the polish'd wain
6150	The costly ransom took of Hector's head.
6150	Two robes they left, and one well-woven vest,
6150	To clothe the corpse, and send with honour home.
6150	Then to the female slaves he gave command
6150	To wash the body, and anoint with oil,
6150	Apart, that Priam might not see his son;
6150	Lest his griev'd heart its passion unrestrain'd
6150	Should utter, and Achilles, rous'd to wrath,
6150	His suppliant slay, and Jove's command transgress.
6150	When they had wash'd the body, and with oil
6150	Anointed, and around it wrapp'd the robe
6150	And vest, Achilles lifted up the dead
6150	With his own hands, and laid him on the couch;
6150	Which to the polish'd wain his followers rais'd.
6150	Then groaning, on his friend by name he call'd:
6150	"""Forgive, Patroclus! be not wroth with me,"
6150	If in the realm of darkness thou shouldst hear
6150	That godlike Hector to his father's arms,
6150	For no mean ransom, I restore; whereof
6150	"A fitting share for thee I set aside."""
6150	""
6150	This said, Achilles to the tent return'd;
6150	On the carv'd couch, from whence he rose, he sat
6150	Beside the wall; and thus to Priam spoke:
6150	""
6150	"""Old man, thy son, according to thy pray'r,"
6150	Is giv'n thee back; upon the couch he lies;
6150	Thyself shalt see him at the dawn of day.
6150	Meanwhile the ev'ning meal demands our care.
6150	Not fair-hair'd Niobe abstain'd from food
6150	When in the house her children lay in death,
6150	Six beauteous daughters and six stalwart sons.
6150	The youths, Apollo with his silver bow,
6150	The maids, the Archer-Queen, Diana, slew,
6150	With anger fill'd that Niobe presum'd
6150	Herself with fair Latona to compare,
6150	Her many children with her rival's two;
6150	So by the two were all the many slain.
6150	Nine days in death they lay; and none was there
6150	To pay their fun'ral rites; for Saturn's son
6150	Had given to all the people hearts of stone.
6150	At length th' immortal Gods entomb'd the dead.
6150	Nor yet did Niobe, when now her grief
6150	Had worn itself in tears, from food refrain.
6150	And now in Sipylus, amid the rocks,
6150	And lonely mountains, where the Goddess nymphs
6150	That love to dance by Achelous' stream,
6150	'Tis said, were cradled, she, though turn'd to stone,
6150	Broods o'er the wrongs inflicted by the Gods.
6150	So we too, godlike sire, the meal may share;
6150	And later, thou thy noble son mayst mourn,
6150	"To Troy restor'd--well worthy he thy tears."""
6150	""
6150	This said, he slaughter'd straight a white-fleec'd sheep;
6150	His comrades then the carcase flay'd and dress'd:
6150	The meat prepar'd, and fasten'd to the spits;
6150	Roasted with care, and from the fire withdrew.
6150	The bread Automedon from baskets fair
6150	Apportion'd out; the meat Achilles shar'd.
6150	They on the viands set before them fell.
6150	The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,
6150	In wonder Priam on Achilles gaz'd,
6150	His form and stature; as a God he seem'd;
6150	And he too look'd on Priam, and admir'd
6150	His venerable face, and gracious speech.
6150	With mutual pleasure each on other gaz'd,
6150	Till godlike Priam first address'd his host:
6150	""
6150	"""Dismiss me now, illustrious chief, to rest;"
6150	And lie we down, in gentle slumbers wrapp'd;
6150	For never have mine eyes been clos'd in sleep,
6150	Since by thy hand my gallant son was slain:
6150	But groaning still, I brood upon my woes,
6150	And in my court with dust my head defile.
6150	Now have I tasted bread, now ruddy wine
6150	"Hath o'er my palate pass'd; but not till now."""
6150	""
6150	Thus he; his comrades and th' attendant maids
6150	Achilles order'd in the corridor
6150	Two mattresses to place, with blankets fair
6150	Of purple wool o'erlaid; and on the top
6150	Rugs and soft sheets for upper cov'ring spread.
6150	They from the chamber, torch in hand, withdrew,
6150	And with obedient haste two beds prepar'd.
6150	Then thus Achilles spoke in jesting tone:
6150	"""Thou needs must sleep without, my good old friend;"
6150	Lest any leader of the Greeks should come,
6150	As is their custom, to confer with me;
6150	Of them whoe'er should find thee here by night
6150	Forthwith to Agamemnon would report,
6150	And Hector might not be so soon, restor'd.
6150	But tell me truly this; how many days
6150	For godlike Hector's fun'ral rites ye need;
6150	That for so long a time I may myself
6150	"Refrain from combat, and the people stay."""
6150	""
6150	To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:
6150	"""If by thy leave we may indeed perform"
6150	His fun'ral rites, to thee, Achilles, great
6150	Will be our gratitude, if this thou grant.
6150	Thou know'st how close the town is hemm'd around;
6150	And from the mountain, distant as it is,
6150	The Trojans well may fear to draw the wood.
6150	Nine days to public mourning would we give;
6150	The tenth, to fun'ral rites and fun'ral feast;
6150	Then on th' eleventh would we raise his mound;
6150	"The twelfth, renew the war, if needs we must."""
6150	""
6150	To whom Achilles swift of foot replied:
6150	"""So shall it be, old Priam; I engage"
6150	"To stay the battle for the time requir'd."""
6150	""
6150	Thus speaking, with his hand the old man's wrist
6150	He grasp'd, in token that he need not fear.
6150	Then in the corridor lay down to rest
6150	Old Priam and the herald, Elders sage;
6150	While in his tent's recess Achilles slept,
6150	The fair Briseis resting by his side.
6150	""
6150	In night-long slumbers lay the other Gods,
6150	And helmed chiefs, by gentle sleep subdued;
6150	But on the eyes of Hermes, Guardian-God,
6150	No slumber fell, deep pond'ring in his mind
6150	How from the ships in safety to conduct
6150	The royal Priam, and the guard elude.
6150	Above the sleeper's head he stood, and cried:
6150	"""Old man, small heed thou tak'st of coining ill,"
6150	Who, when Achilles gives thee leave to go,
6150	Sleep'st undisturb'd, surrounded by thy foes.
6150	Thy son hath been restor'd, and thou hast paid
6150	A gen'rous price; but to redeem thy life,
6150	If Agamemnon and the other Greeks
6150	Should know that thou art here, full thrice so much
6150	"Thy sons, who yet are left, would have to pay."""
6150	""
6150	He said; the old man trembled, and arous'd
6150	The herald; while the horses and the mules
6150	Were yok'd by Hermes, who with silent speed
6150	Drove through th' encampment, unobserv'd of all.
6150	But when they came to eddying Xanthus' ford,
6150	Fair-flowing stream, born of immortal Jove,
6150	To high Olympus Hermes took his flight,
6150	As morn, in saffron robe, o'er all the earth
6150	Was light diffusing; they with fun'ral wail
6150	Drove cityward the horses; following came
6150	The mules that drew the litter of the dead.
6150	The plain they travers'd o'er, observ'd of none,
6150	Or man or woman, till Cassandra, fair
6150	As golden Venus, from the topmost height
6150	Of Pergamus, her father in his car
6150	Upstanding saw, the herald at his side.
6150	Him too she saw, who on the litter lay;
6150	Then lifted up her voice, and cried aloud
6150	"To all the city, ""Hither, Trojans, come,"
6150	Both men and women, Hector see restor'd;
6150	If, while he liv'd, returning from the fight,
6150	Ye met him e'er rejoicing, who indeed
6150	"Was all the city's chiefest joy and pride."""
6150	""
6150	She said; nor man nor woman then was left
6150	Within the city; o'er the minds of all
6150	Grief pass'd, resistless; to the gates in throngs
6150	They press'd, to crowd round him who brought the dead.
6150	The first to clasp the body were his wife
6150	And honour'd mother; eagerly they sprang
6150	On the smooth-rolling wain, to touch the head
6150	Of Hector; round them, weeping, stood the crowd
6150	Weeping, till sunset, all the live-long day
6150	Had they before the gates for Hector mourn'd;
6150	Had not old Priam from the car address'd
6150	"The crowd: ""Make way, that so the mules may pass;"
6150	When to my house I shall have brought my dead,
6150	"Ye there may vent your sorrow as ye will."""
6150	""
6150	Thus as he spoke, obedient to his word
6150	They stood aside, and for the car made way:
6150	But when to Priam's lordly house they came,
6150	They laid him on a rich-wrought couch, and call'd
6150	The minstrels in, who by the hero's bed
6150	Should lead the melancholy chorus; they
6150	Pour'd forth the music of the mournful dirge,
6150	While women's voices join'd in loud lament.
6150	White-arm'd Andromache the wail began,
6150	The head of Hector clasping in her hands:
6150	"""My husband, thou art gone in pride of youth,"
6150	And in thine house hast left me desolate;
6150	Thy child an infant still, thy child and mine,
6150	Unhappy parents both! nor dare I hope
6150	That he may reach the ripeness of his youth;
6150	For ere that day shall Troy in ruin fall,
6150	Since thou art gone, her guardian! thou whose arm
6150	Defended her, her wives, and helpless babes!
6150	They now shall shortly o'er the sea be borne,
6150	And with them I shall go; thou too, my child,
6150	Must follow me, to servile labour doom'd,
6150	The suff'ring victim of a tyrant Lord;
6150	Unless perchance some angry Greek may seize
6150	And dash thee from the tow'r--a woful death!
6150	Whose brother, or whose father, or whose son
6150	By Hector hath been slain; for many a Greek
6150	By Hector's hand hath bit the bloody dust;
6150	Not light in battle was thy father's hand!
6150	Therefore for him the gen'ral city mourns;
6150	Thou to thy parents bitter grief hast caus'd,
6150	Hector! but bitt'rest grief of all hast left
6150	To me! for not to me was giv'n to clasp
6150	The hand extended from thy dying bed,
6150	Nor words of wisdom catch, which night and day,
6150	"With tears, I might have treasur'd in my heart."""
6150	""
6150	Weeping she spoke--the women join'd the wail.
6150	Then Hecuba took up the loud lament:
6150	"""Hector, of all my children dearest thou!"
6150	Dear to th' Immortals too in life wast thou,
6150	And they in death have borne thee still in mind;
6150	For other of my sons, his captives made,
6150	Across the wat'ry waste, to Samos' isle
6150	Or Imbros, or th' inhospitable shore
6150	Of Lemnos, hath Achilles, swift of foot,
6150	To slav'ry sold; thee, when his sharp-edg'd spear
6150	Had robb'd thee of thy life, he dragg'd indeed
6150	Around Patroclus' tomb, his comrade dear,
6150	Whom thou hadst slain; yet so he rais'd not up
6150	Ilis dead to life again; now liest thou here,
6150	All fresh and fair, as dew-besprent; like one
6150	Whom bright Apollo, with his arrows keen,
6150	"God of the silver bow, hath newly slain."""
6150	""
6150	Weeping, she spoke; and rous'd the gen'ral grief.
6150	Then Helen, third, the mournful strain renew'd:
6150	"""Hector, of all my brethren dearest thou!"
6150	True, godlike Paris claims me as his wife,
6150	Who bore me hither--would I then had died!
6150	But twenty years have pass'd since here I came,
6150	And left my native land; yet ne'er from thee
6150	I heard one scornful, one degrading word;
6150	And when from others I have borne reproach,
6150	Thy brothers, sisters, or thy brothers' wives,
6150	Or mother, (for thy sire was ever kind
6150	E'en as a father) thou hast check'd them still
6150	With tender feeling, and with gentle words.
6150	For thee I weep, and for myself no less:
6150	For, through the breadth of Troy, none love me now,
6150	"None kindly look on me, but all abhor."""
6150	""
6150	Weeping she spoke, and with her wept the crowd.
6150	At length the aged Priam gave command:
6150	"""Haste now, ye Trojans, to the city bring"
6150	Good store of fuel; fear no treach'rous wile;
6150	For when he sent me from the dark-ribb'd ships,
6150	Achilles promis'd that from hostile arms
6150	"Till the twelfth morn we should no harm sustain."""
6150	""
6150	He said; and they the oxen and the mules
6150	Yok'd to the wains, and from the city throng'd:
6150	Nine days they labour'd, and brought back to Troy
6150	Good store of wood; but when the tenth day's light
6150	Upon the earth appear'd, weeping, they bore
6150	Brave Hector out; and on the fun'ral pile
6150	Laying the glorious dead, applied the torch.
6150	""
6150	While yet the rosy-finger'd morn was young
6150	Round noble Hector's pyre the people press'd:
6150	When all were gather'd round, and closely throng'd
6150	First on the burning mass, as far as spread
6150	The range of fire, they pour'd the ruddy wine,
6150	And quench'd the flames: his brethren then and friends
6150	Weeping, the hot tears flowing down their cheeks,
6150	Collected from the pile the whiten'd bones;
6150	These in a golden casket they enclos'd,
6150	And o'er it spread soft shawls of purple dye;
6150	Then in a grave they laid it, and in haste
6150	With stone in pond'rous masses cover'd o'er;
6150	And rais'd a mound, and watch'd on ev'ry side,
6150	From sudden inroad of the Greeks to guard.
6150	The mound erected, back they turn'd; and all
6150	Assembled duly, shar'd the solemn feast
6150	In Priam's palace, Heav'n-descended King.
6150	""
6150	Such were the rites to glorious Hector paid.

6150	FOOTNOTES
6150	""
6150	[1]
6150	""
6150	The text of the original leaves it somewhat in doubt whether
6150	the anger of the Greeks were directed against Thersites or Agamemnon. I
6150	believe the preponderance of authority, ancient and modern, is in
6150	favour of the former interpretation; but the latter is not without the
6150	support of some eminent scholars, and after much consideration I have
6150	been induced to adopt it. The original represents the Greeks as filled
6150	with anger _and resentment_ against _some one._ Thersites was an
6150	object of general contempt, but he had done nothing to excite those
6150	feelings: indeed, apart from the offensiveness of his tone, the public
6150	sympathy was with him; for the army was deeply dissatisfied, and
6150	resented the conduct of Agamemnon against Achilles, mainly perhaps
6150	because they had ceased to be enriched with the plunder of his
6150	successful forays (see i. 202, and ix. 387). This dissatisfaction and
6150	resentment are referred to by Neptune (xiii. 126), and by Agamemnon
6150	himself (xiv. 55). They had lately manifested themselves in the
6150	alacrity with which the whole army had caught at the insidious
6150	suggestion of abandoning the war; and, just before the second assembly,
6150	Thersites avails himself of the general feeling, constituting himself
6150	the representative of a popular grievance, to vent his personal spite
6150	against Agamemnon. Ulysses saw how dangerous such a display might be at
6150	such a moment; and artfully assuming (line 281) that the feeling was
6150	confined to Thersites alone (though in his subsequent speech, line 335,
6150	he admits and excuses the general discontent), he proceeds to cut short
6150	its expression by summary chastisement. Thereupon the fickle multitude,
6150	"""despite their anger"" (against Agamemnon), cannot refrain from laughing"
6150	at the signal discomfiture of their self-constituted champion.
6150	""
6150	This view is very fully set forth in a note on the passage appended to
6150	a translation of the Iliad by Mr. Barter, published in 1859, but which
